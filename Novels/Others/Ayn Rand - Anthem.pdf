T* T* T* (It is a sin to write this.  It is a sin) Tj
T* (to think words no others think and to put) Tj
T* (them down upon a paper no others are to see.) Tj
T* (It is base and evil.  It is as if we were) Tj
T* (speaking alone to no ears but our own.) Tj
T* (And we know well that there is no transgression) Tj
T* (blacker than to do or think alone.) Tj
T* (We have broken the laws.  The laws say) Tj
T* (that men may not write unless the Council) Tj
T* (of Vocations bid them so.  May we be forgiven!) Tj
T* T* (But this is not the only sin upon us.) Tj
T* (We have committed a greater crime, and for) Tj
T* (this crime there is no name.  What punishment) Tj
T* (awaits us if it be discovered we know not,) Tj
T* (for no such crime has come in the memory) Tj
T* (of men and there are no laws to provide for it.) Tj
T* T* (It is dark here.  The flame of the candle) Tj
T* (stands still in the air.  Nothing moves in) Tj
T* (this tunnel save our hand on the paper.  We are) Tj
T* (alone here under the earth.  It is a fearful) Tj
T* (word, alone.  The laws say that none among) Tj

T* (before us the shadow of our one head.) Tj

T* (mercy upon us!--we wish to speak for once) Tj
T* (to no ears but our own.) Tj
T* T* (Our name is Equality 7-2521, as it is) Tj
T* (written on the iron bracelet which all men) Tj
T* (wear on their left wrists with their names) Tj
T* (upon it.  We are twenty-one years old.  We) Tj
T* (are six feet tall, and this is a burden, for) Tj
T* (there are not many men who are six feet tall.) Tj
T* (Ever have the Teachers and the Leaders pointed) Tj
T* (to us and frowned and said:) Tj
T* T* ("There is evil in your bones, Equality 7-2521,) Tj
T* (for your body has grown beyond the bodies) Tj
T* (of your brothers."  But we cannot change) Tj
T* (our bones nor our body.) Tj
T* T* (We were born with a curse.  It has always) Tj
T* (driven us to thoughts which are forbidden.) Tj
T* (It has always given us wishes which men) Tj
T* (may not wish.  We know that we are evil,) Tj
T* (but there is no will in us and no power) Tj
T* (to resist it.  This is our wonder and our) Tj
T* (secret fear, that we know and do not resist.) Tj
T* T* (We strive to be like all our brother men,) Tj
T* (for all men must be alike.  Over the portals) Tj
T* (of the Palace of the World Council, there) Tj
T* (are words cut in the marble, which we) Tj
T* (repeat to ourselves whenever we are tempted:) Tj
T* T* T* (  "WE ARE ONE IN ALL AND ALL IN ONE.) Tj
T* (  THERE ARE NO MEN BUT ONLY THE GREAT _WE_,) Tj
T* (  ONE, INDIVISIBLE AND FOREVER.") Tj
T* T* T* (We repeat this to ourselves, but it helps us not.) Tj
T* T* (These words were cut long ago.  There is) Tj
T* (green mould in the grooves of the letters) Tj
T* (and yellow streaks on the marble, which) Tj
T* (come from more years than men could) Tj
T* (count.  And these words are the truth,) Tj
T* (for  they are written on the Palace of the) Tj
T* (World Council, and the World Council is the) Tj
T* (body of all truth.  Thus has it been ever) Tj
T* (since the Great Rebirth, and farther back) Tj
T* (than that no memory can reach.) Tj
T* T* (But we must never speak of the times before) Tj
T* (the Great Rebirth, else we are sentenced to) Tj
T* (three years in the Palace of Corrective Detention.) Tj
T* (It is only the Old Ones who whisper about it in) Tj
T* (the evenings, in the Home of the Useless.) Tj
T* (They whisper many strange things, of the towers) Tj
T* (which rose to the sky, in those Unmentionable) Tj

T* (burned without flame.  But those times) Tj
T* (were evil.  And those times passed away,) Tj
T* (when men saw the Great Truth which is this:) Tj
T* (that all men are one and that there is no) Tj
T* (will save the will of all men together.) Tj
T* T* (All men are good and wise.  It is only we,) Tj
T* (Equality 7-2521, we alone who were born) Tj
T* (with a curse.  For we are not like our brothers.) Tj
T* (And as we look back upon our life,) Tj
T* (we see that it has ever been thus and that) Tj
T* (it has brought us step by step to our last,) Tj
T* (supreme transgression, our crime of crimes) Tj
T* (hidden here under the ground.) Tj
T* T* (We remember the Home of the Infants) Tj
T* (where we lived till we were five years old,) Tj
T* (together with all the children of the City) Tj
T* (who had been born in the same year.) Tj
T* (The sleeping halls there were white and clean) Tj
T* (and bare of all things save one hundred beds.) Tj
T* (We were just like all our brothers) Tj
T* (then, save for the one transgression:) Tj
T* (we fought with our brothers.  There are few) Tj
T* (offenses blacker than to fight with our) Tj
T* (brothers, at any age and for any cause) Tj
T* (whatsoever.  The Council of the Home told) Tj
T* (us so, and of all the children of that year,) Tj
T* (we were locked in the cellar most often.) Tj
T* T* (When we were five years old, we were) Tj
T* (sent to the Home of the Students, where) Tj
T* (there are ten wards, for our ten years of) Tj
T* (learning.  Men must learn till they reach) Tj
T* (their fifteenth year.  Then they go to work.) Tj
T* (In the Home of the Students we arose when) Tj
T* (the big bell rang in the tower and we went) Tj
T* (to our beds when it rang again.  Before we) Tj
T* (removed our garments, we stood in the) Tj
T* (great sleeping hall, and we raised our right) Tj
T* (arms, and we said all together with the) Tj
T* (three Teachers at the head:) Tj
T* T* ("We are nothing.  Mankind is all.  By the grace) Tj
T* (of our brothers are we allowed our lives.) Tj
T* (We exist through, by and for our brothers) Tj
T* (who are the State.  Amen.") Tj
T* T* (Then we slept.  The sleeping halls were white) Tj
T* (and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds.) Tj
T* T* (We, Equality 7-2521, were not happy in) Tj
T* (those years in the Home of the Students.) Tj
T* (It was not that the learning was too hard) Tj
T* (for us.  It was that the learning was too easy.) Tj
T* (This is a great sin, to be born with a) Tj
T* (head which is too quick.  It is not good) Tj
T* (to be different from our brothers, but it) Tj
T* (is evil to be superior to them.  The Teachers) Tj

T* (told us so, and they frowned when they looked upon us.) Tj
T* T* (So we fought against this curse.  We tried) Tj
T* (to forget our lessons, but we always remembered.) Tj
T* (We tried not to understand what the Teachers taught,) Tj
T* (but we always understood it before the Teachers) Tj
T* (had spoken.  We looked upon Union 5-3992,) Tj
T* (who were a pale boy with only half a brain,) Tj
T* (and we tried to say and do as they did,) Tj
T* (that we might be like them, like Union 5-3992,) Tj
T* (but somehow the Teachers knew that we were not.) Tj
T* (And we were lashed more often than all the other children.) Tj
T* T* (The Teachers were just, for they had) Tj
T* (been appointed by the Councils, and the) Tj
T* (Councils are the voice of all justice,) Tj
T* (for they are the voice of all men.  And if) Tj
T* (sometimes, in the secret darkness of our heart,) Tj
T* (we regret that which befell us on our) Tj
T* (fifteenth birthday, we know that it was) Tj
T* (through our own guilt.  We had broken) Tj
T* (a law, for we had not paid heed to the) Tj
T* (words of our Teachers.  The Teachers) Tj
T* (had said to us all:) Tj
T* T* ("Dare not choose in your minds the) Tj
T* (work you would like to do when you leave) Tj
T* (the Home of the Students.  You shall do) Tj
T* (that which the Council of Vocations shall) Tj
T* (prescribe for you.  For the Council of) Tj
T* (Vocations knows in its great wisdom where) Tj
T* (you are needed by your brother men, better) Tj
T* (than you can know it in your unworthy) Tj
T* (little minds.  And if you are not needed by) Tj
T* (your brother man, there is no reason for) Tj
T* (you to burden the earth with your bodies.") Tj
T* T* (We knew this well, in the years of our) Tj
T* (childhood, but our curse broke our will.) Tj
T* (We were guilty and we confess it here:) Tj
T* (we were guilty of the great Transgression) Tj
T* (of Preference.  We preferred some work) Tj
T* (and some lessons to the others.  We did not) Tj
T* (listen well to the history of all the) Tj
T* (Councils elected since the Great Rebirth.) Tj
T* (But we loved the Science of Things.  We wished) Tj
T* (to know.  We wished to know about all the) Tj
T* (things which make the earth around us.) Tj
T* (We asked so many questions that) Tj
T* (the Teachers forbade it.) Tj
T* T* (We think that there are mysteries in the) Tj
T* (sky and under the water and in the plants) Tj
T* (which grow.  But the Council of Scholars) Tj
T* (has said that there are no mysteries,) Tj
T* (and the Council of Scholars knows all things.) Tj

T* (of all the winds which blow over the seas) Tj
T* (and push the sails of our great ships.) Tj
T* (We learned how to bleed men to cure them) Tj
T* (of all ailments.) Tj
T* T* (We loved the Science of Things.  And in) Tj
T* (the darkness, in the secret hour, when we) Tj
T* (awoke in the night and there were no) Tj
T* (brothers around us, but only their shapes) Tj
T* (in the beds and their snores, we closed our) Tj
T* (eyes, and we held our lips shut, and we) Tj
T* (stopped our breath, that no shudder might) Tj
T* (let our brothers see or hear or guess,) Tj
T* (and we thought that we wished to be sent) Tj
T* (to the Home of the Scholars when our time) Tj
T* (would come.) Tj
T* T* (All the great modern inventions come) Tj
T* (from the Home of the Scholars, such as) Tj
T* (the newest one, which was found only a) Tj
T* (hundred years ago, of how to make candles) Tj
T* (from wax and string; also, how to make glass,) Tj
T* (which is put in our windows to protect) Tj
T* (us from the rain.  To find these things,) Tj
T* (the Scholars must study the earth and learn) Tj
T* (from the rivers, from the sands, from the) Tj
T* (winds and the rocks.  And if we went to the) Tj
T* (Home of the Scholars, we could learn from) Tj
T* (these also.  We could ask questions of these,) Tj
T* (for they do not forbid questions.) Tj
T* T* (And questions give us no rest.  We know not) Tj
T* (why our curse makes us seek we know not what,) Tj
T* (ever and ever.  But we cannot resist it.) Tj
T* (It whispers to us that there are great things) Tj
T* (on this earth of ours, and that we can know them) Tj
T* (if we try, and that we must know them.  We ask,) Tj
T* (why must we know, but it has no answer to give us.) Tj
T* (We must know that we may know.) Tj
T* T* (So we wished to be sent to the Home of) Tj
T* (the Scholars.  We wished it so much that) Tj
T* (our hands trembled under the blankets in) Tj
T* (the night, and we bit our arm to stop that) Tj
T* (other pain which we could not endure.) Tj
T* (It was evil and we dared not face our brothers) Tj
T* (in the morning.  For men may wish nothing) Tj
T* (for themselves.  And we were punished) Tj
T* (when the Council of Vocations came to) Tj
T* (give us our life Mandates which tell those) Tj
T* (who reach their fifteenth year what their) Tj
T* (work is to be for the rest of their days.) Tj
T* T* (The Council of Vocations came on the first day) Tj
T* (of spring, and they sat in the great hall.) Tj

T* (and they had but two words to speak to each) Tj
T* (of the Students.  They called the Students' names,) Tj
T* (and when the Students stepped before them,) Tj
T* (one after another, the Council said:) Tj
T* ("Carpenter" or "Doctor" or "Cook" or "Leader.") Tj
T* (Then each Student raised their right arm and said:) Tj
T* ("The will of our brothers be done.") Tj
T* T* (Now if the Council has said "Carpenter" or "Cook,") Tj
T* (the Students so assigned go to work and they do not) Tj
T* (study any further.  But if the Council has said "Leader,") Tj
T* (then those Students go into the Home of the Leaders,) Tj
T* (which is the greatest house in the City, for it has) Tj

T* (so that they may become candidates and be elected) Tj

T* (to the dais, and our legs did not tremble,) Tj
T* (and we looked up at the Council.  There were) Tj
T* (five members of the Council, three of) Tj
T* (the male gender and two of the female.) Tj
T* (Their hair was white and their faces were) Tj
T* (cracked as the clay of a dry river bed.) Tj
T* (They were old.  They seemed older than) Tj
T* (the marble of the Temple of the World Council.) Tj
T* (They sat before us and they did not move.) Tj
T* (And we saw no breath to stir the folds) Tj
T* (of their white togas.  But we knew that) Tj
T* (they were alive, for a finger of the hand) Tj
T* (of the oldest rose, pointed to us, and fell down again.) Tj
T* (This was the only thing which moved, for the lips of) Tj
T* (the oldest did not move as they said:  "Street Sweeper.") Tj

T* (as our head rose higher to look upon the) Tj
T* (faces of the Council, and we were happy.) Tj
T* (We knew we had been guilty, but now we) Tj
T* (had a way to atone for it.  We would accept) Tj
T* (our Life Mandate, and we would work for) Tj
T* (our brothers, gladly and willingly,) Tj
T* (and we would erase our sin against them,) Tj
T* (which they did not know, but we knew.) Tj

T* T* ("It is forbidden," they answered.) Tj
T* T* (We said:  "The Council does not know) Tj

T* T* (We had broken so many laws, and today) Tj

T* T* (The other women were far off in the) Tj

T* (kneeling alone at the moat which runs) Tj
T* (through the field.  And the drops of water) Tj
T* (falling from their hands, as they raised the) Tj
T* (water to their lips, were like sparks of fire) Tj
T* (in the sun.  Then the Golden One saw us,) Tj
T* (and they did not move, kneeling there,) Tj
T* (looking at us, and circles of light played) Tj
T* (upon their white tunic, from the sun on the) Tj
T* (water of the moat, and one sparkling drop) Tj
T* (fell from a finger of their hand held as) Tj
T* (frozen in the air.) Tj
T* T* (Then the Golden One rose and walked) Tj
T* (to the hedge, as if they had heard a) Tj
T* (command in our eyes.  The two other Street) Tj
T* (Sweepers of our brigade were a hundred) Tj
T* (paces away down the road.  And we) Tj
T* (thought that International 4-8818 would) Tj
T* (not betray us, and Union 5-3992 would) Tj
T* (not understand.  So we looked straight upon) Tj
T* (the Golden One, and we saw the shadows) Tj
T* (of their lashes on their white cheeks and) Tj
T* (the sparks of sun on their lips.  And we said:) Tj
T* T* ("You are beautiful, Liberty 5-3000.") Tj
T* T* (Their face did not move and they did not) Tj
T* (avert their eyes.  Only their eyes grew wider,) Tj
T* (and there was triumph in their eyes,) Tj
T* (and it was not triumph over us,) Tj
T* (but over things we could not guess.) Tj
T* T* (Then they asked:) Tj
T* T* ("What is your name?") Tj
T* T* ("Equality 7-2521," we answered.) Tj

T* (I have learned from the books, and I wonder.) Tj
T* (It was a long story, and the spirit which moved it) Tj
T* (was the spirit of man's freedom.) Tj
T* (But what is freedom?  Freedom from what?) Tj
T* (There is nothing to take a man's freedom away) Tj
T* (from him, save other men.  To be free,) Tj
T* (a man must be free of his brothers.) Tj
T* (That is freedom.  That and nothing else.) Tj
T* T* (At first, man was enslaved by the gods.) Tj
T* (But he broke their chains.  Then he was) Tj
T* (enslaved by the kings.  But he broke their chains.) Tj
T* (He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin,) Tj
T* (by his race.  But he broke their chains.) Tj
T* (He declared to all his brothers that) Tj
T* (a man has rights which neither god nor) Tj
T* (king nor other men can take away from him,) Tj
T* (no matter what their number, for his is) Tj
T* (the right of man, and there is no right) Tj
T* (on earth above this right.  And he stood on) Tj
T* (the threshold of the freedom for which the) Tj
T* (blood of the centuries behind him had been spilled.) Tj
T* T* (But then he gave up all he had won,) Tj
T* (and fell lower than his savage beginning.) Tj
T* T* (What brought it to pass?  What disaster took) Tj
T* (their reason away from men?  What whip) Tj
T* (lashed them to their knees in shame and) Tj
T* (submission?  The worship of the word) Tj
T* ("We.") Tj
T* T* (When men accepted that worship,) Tj
T* (the structure of centuries collaped) Tj
T* (about them, the structure whose every beam) Tj
T* (had come from the thought of some one man,) Tj
T* (each in his day down the ages, from the depth) Tj
T* (of some one spirit, such spirit as existed) Tj
T* (but for its own sake.  Those men who survived) Tj
T* (those eager to obey, eager to live for one) Tj
T* (another, since they had nothing else to) Tj

T* (in those graceless years of transition,) Tj
T* (long ago, that men did not see whither they) Tj
T* (were going, and went on, in blindness and) Tj
T* (cowardice, to their fate.  I wonder, for it) Tj
T* (is hard for me to conceive how men who) Tj

T* (not know what they lost.  But such has been) Tj
T* (the story, for I have lived in the City of) Tj
T* (the damned, and I know what horror men) Tj

T* (their banners smeared by their own blood.) Tj
T* (And they chose to perish, for they knew.) Tj
T* (To them, I send my salute across the centuries,) Tj

T* T* (Theirs is the banner in my hand.  And I wish) Tj
T* (I had the power to tell them that the despair) Tj
T* (of their hearts was not to be final,) Tj
T* (and their night was not without hope.) Tj
T* (For the battle they lost can never be lost.) Tj
T* (For that which they died to save can never perish.) Tj
T* (Through all the darkness, through) Tj
T* (all the shame of which men are capable,) Tj
T* (the spirit of man will remain alive on this) Tj
T* (earth.  It may sleep, but it will awaken.) Tj
T* (It may wear chains, but it will break through.) Tj
T* (And man will go on.  Man, not men.) Tj
T* T* (Here on this mountain, I and my sons) Tj
T* (and my chosen friends shall build our new) Tj
T* (land and our fort.  And it will become as) Tj
T* (the heart of the earth, lost and hidden at) Tj
T* (first, but beating, beating louder each day.) Tj
T* (And word of it will reach every corner) Tj
T* (of the earth.  And the roads of the world) Tj
T* (will become as veins which will carry the) Tj
T* (best of the world's blood to my threshold.) Tj
