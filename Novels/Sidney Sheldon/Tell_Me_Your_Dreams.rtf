She turned to study herself in her bedroom mirror. She was looking at the image of a woman in her late twenties, neatly dressed, with patrician features, a slim figure and intelligent, anxious brown eyes. There was a quiet elegance about her, a subtle att
ractiveness. Her dark hair fell softly to her shoulders.}{\fs24\lang1024\langfe1024\cgrid0\noproof\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538  }{\i\fs24\lang1024\langfe1024\cgrid0\noproof\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 I}{

ley had thought of it as a comfortable nest, a haven. Now it had turned into a fortress, a place where no one could get in to harm her. Ashley walked to the front door and examined the lock. }{\fs24\cf1\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 I}{

ed off all the lights, checked to make sure the door was firmly locked behind her and took the elevator to the basement garage.
\par The garage was deserted. Her car was twenty feet from the elevator. She looked around carefully, then ran to the car, slid inside and locked the doors, her heart pounding. She headed downtown, under a sky the color of malice, dark and forebo}{

 Ashley thought. }{\i\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 The sun is going to come out. I'll make a deal with you, God. If it doesn't rain, it means that everything is all right, that I've been imagining things.
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 Ten minutes later, Ashley }{\fs24\cf1\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 Patterson}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538  was driving through downtown Cupertino. She was still awed by the mira
cle of what this once sleepy little corner of Santa Clara Valley had become. Located fifty miles south of San Francisco, it was where the computer revolution had started, and it had been appropriately nicknamed Silicon Valley.
\par Ashley was employed at Global Computer Graphics Corporation, a successful, fast-growing young company with two hundred employees.
\par As Ashley tu}{\fs24\cf1\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 rn}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 ed the car onto }{\fs24\cf1\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 Silverado}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538

\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538  She looked into her rearview}{\fs24\cf1\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538  }{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 
mirror. Everything seemed normal. Every instinct told her otherwise. Ahead of Ashley was the sprawling, modem-looking building that housed Global Computer Graphics. She turned into the parking lot, showed the guard her id
entification and pulled into her parking space. She felt safe here. As she got out of the car, it began to rain.
\par At nine o'clock in the morning, Global Computer Graphics was already humming with activity. There were eighty mod}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 u}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 lar cubicles, occupied by com

 for record and book publishing companies and composing illustrations for magazines. The work floor was divided into several divisions: administr}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 a}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 tion, sale

ning, he had tried to persuade Ashley to go to bed with him, but he had finally given up, and they had become good friends.
\par He handed Ashley a copy of the latest }{\i\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 Time}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538  magazine. "Seen this?"
\par Ashley looked at the cover. It featured a picture of a distinguished-looking man in his fifties, with silver hair. The caption read "Dr. }{\fs24\cf1\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 Steven}{\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538  }{

\par "I've seen it."
\par "How does it feel to have a famous father?" 
\par Ashley smiled. "Wonderful." 
\par "He's a great man."
\par "I'll tell him you said so. We're having lunch."

 a portico. It was there that her father had become famous.

 therapy. His specialty was treating multiple personality disorder, and while he had had failures, his success rate was high. In cases like this, there were no easy answers. His first job was to get the patient to trust him, to feel comfortable with him, 
and then to bring out the alters, one by one, so that in the end they could communicate with one another and understand why they existed, and finally, why there was no more need for them. T}{\fs24\cf1\cgrid0\insrsid13389741\charrsid1206538 h}{

\par He looked at Ashley, asleep in her chair, then leaned forward. "Good morning, Tonni. Can you hear me?" 
\par He watched Ashley's face transform, taken over by an entirely different personality. There was a sudden vivacity in her face. She began to sing:

sharp edge and placed it on her wrist. In one fast, deep movement, she cut into her veins and her blood began to pour out. Ashley placed the jagged edge on her other wrist and repeated the movement. She stood there, watching the blood stain the carpet. Sh

\par "Do you remember how hard we tried to find the trauma that had caused her condition, and we failed?"
\par David remembered it well. It had been a major weakness in their case. "Yes."
