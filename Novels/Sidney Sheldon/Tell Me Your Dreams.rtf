\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\cf1\i0\fs80 S\fs24 omeone\cf0  was\scaps  \scaps0 following \cf1 h\cf0 er. She had \cf1 r\cf0 ead about \cf1 stalkers,\cf0  but they belonged in a different, violent world. She had no idea who it could be, who would want to harm her. She was trying desperately hard not to panic, but lately her sleep had been filled with unbearable nightmares, and she had awakened each morning with a feeling of impending doom. \i Perhaps it's all in my imagination,\i0  \cf1 Ashley\cf0  \cf1 Patterson\cf0  thought. \i I'm working too hard. I need a vacation.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi200\sl-260\slmult0\qj\i0 She turned to study herself in her bedroom mirror. She was looking at the image of a woman in her late twenties, neatly dressed, with patrician features, a slim figure and intelligent, anxious brown eyes. There was a quiet elegance about her, a subtle attractiveness. Her dark hair fell softly to her shoulders.\lang1024  \i I\lang1033\i0  \i hate my looks,\i0  Ashley though\cf1 t.\cf0  \i I'm too thin. I must start eating more.\i0  S\cf1 h\cf0 e\f3  \f0 walked into the kitchen and began to fix breakfast, forcing her mind to forget about the \cf1 f\cf0 rightening thing that was happening, and concentrating on preparing a fluffy omelette. She turned on the \cf1 coffeemaker\cf0  and put a slice of bread in the toaster. Ten minutes later, everything was ready. \cf1 Ashley\cf0  placed the dishes on the table and sat down. She picked up a fork, stared at the food for a moment, then shook her head in despair. Fear had taken away her appetite.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj This can\cf1 't\cf0  go on, she thought angrily. Whoever he is, I won't let him do this to me. I won't.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284 Ashley glanced at her watch. It was time to leave for work. She looked around the familiar apartment, as though seeking some kind of reassurance from it. It was an \cf1 attractively\cf0  furnished third-floor apartment on Via \cf1 Camino\cf0  Court, with a living room, bedroom a\cf1 n\cf0 d den, bathroom, kitchen and guest powder room. She had lived here in \cf1 Cupertino,\cf0  California, for three years. Until two weeks ago, Ashley had thought of it as a comfortable nest, a haven. Now it had turned into a fortress, a place where no one could get in to harm her. Ashley walked to the front door and examined the lock. \cf1 I\cf0 'll have a dead bolt put in, she thought. Tomorrow. She tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed off all the lights, checked to make sure the door was firmly locked behind her and took the elevator to the basement garage.\par
\pard\brdrt\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 \brdrb\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 \nowidctlpar\f3\tab\f0 The garage was deserted. Her car was twenty feet from the elevator. She looked around carefully, then ran to the car, slid inside and locked the doors, her heart pounding. She headed downtown, under a sky the color of malice, dark and foreboding. The weather report had\f3  \lang1024\i\f1\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\sb80\sl-260\slmult0\lang1033\i0\f0 said rain. \i But it's not going to rain,\i0  Ashley thought. \i The sun is going to come out. I'll make a deal with you, God. If it doesn't rain, it means that everything is all right, that I've been imagining things.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i0\par
Ten minutes later, Ashley \cf1 Patterson\cf0  was driving through downtown Cupertino. She was still awed by the miracle of what this once sleepy little corner of Santa Clara Valley had become. Located fifty miles south of San Francisco, it was where the computer revolution had started, and it had been appropriately nicknamed Silicon Valley.\par
Ashley was employed at Global Computer Graphics Corporation, a successful, fast-growing young company with two hundred employees.\par
As Ashley tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed the car onto \cf1 Silverado\cf0  Street, she had the uneasy feeling that \i he\i0  was behind her, following her. \i But who? And why?\i0  She looked into her rearview\cf1  \cf0 mirror. Everything seemed normal. Every instinct told her otherwise. Ahead of Ashley was the sprawling, modem-looking building that housed Global Computer Graphics. She turned into the parking lot, showed the guard her identification and pulled into her parking space. She felt safe here. As she got out of the car, it began to rain.\par
\par
At nine o'clock in the morning, Global Computer Graphics was already humming with activity. There were eighty modular cubicles, occupied by computer whizzes, all young, busily building Web sites, creating logos for\par

The work floor was divided into several divisions: administration, sales, marketing and technical support. The atmosphere was casual. The employees wa\cf1 l\cf0 ked around in jeans, tank tops and sweaters.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj As \cf1 Ashley\cf0  headed toward her desk, her supervisor, \cf1 Shane\cf0  Miller, approached her. "Mo\cf1 rn\cf0 ing, Ashley."\par
\cf1 Shane\cf0  Miller was in his early thirties, a burly, earnest man wit\cf1 h\cf0  a pleasant personality. In the beginning, he had tried to persuade Ashley to go to bed with him, but he had finally given up, and they had become good friends.\par
He handed Ashley a copy of the latest \i Time\i0  magazine. "Seen this?"\par
Ashley looked at the cover. It featured a picture of a distinguished-looking man in his fifties, with silver hair. The caption read "Dr. \cf1 Steven\cf0  \cf1 Patterson,\cf0  Father of Mini Heart Surgery." \par
"I've seen it."\par
"How does it feel to have a famous father?" \par
Ashley smiled. "Wonderful." \par
"He's a great man."\par
"I'll tell him you said so. We're having lunch." \par
"Good. By the way\cf1\lang1024 ..."\cf0\lang1033  Shane Miller showed Ashley a photograph of a movie star who was going to be used in an ad for a client. "We have a little prob\cf1 l\cf0 em here. \cf1 Desiree\cf0  has gained about ten pounds, and it shows. Look at those dark circles under her eyes. And even with makeup, her skin is splotchy. Do you think you can help this?"\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\lang1033\i0\f0 Ashley studied the picture. "I can fix her eyes by applying the blur filter. I could try to thin her face by using the distort tool, but-No. That would probably end up making her look odd." She studied the picture again. "I'll have to airbrush or use the clone tool in some areas."\par
"Thanks. Are we on for Saturday night?" \par
"Yes."\par
Shane Miller \cf1 nodded\cf0  toward the photograph. "There's no hurry on this. They want it last month." Ashley smiled. "What else is new?"\par
\par
She went to work. Ashley was an expert in advertising and graphic design, creating layouts with text and images.\par
Half an hour later, as Ashley was working on the photograph, she sensed someone watching her. She looked up. \cf1 I\cf0 t was Dennis Tibble. "Morning, honey."\par
His voice grated on her nerves. Tibble was the company's computer genius. He was known around the plant as "The Fixer." Whenever a computer crashed, Tibb\cf1 l\cf0 e was sent for. He was in his early thirties, thin and bald with an unpleasant, arrogant attitude. He had an \cf1 obsessive\cf0  personality, and the word around the plant was that he was \cf1 fixated\cf0  on Ashley. \par
"Need any help?" \par
"No, thank you."\par
"Hey, what about us having a little dinner Saturday night?" \par
"Thank you. I'm busy."\par

\cf0\lang1033 "I don't know what you see in him, anyway. He's a \cf1 nerd,\cf0  cubed. I can give you a better time." He winked. "You know what I mean?"\par
Ashley was trying to control her temper. "I have work to do, Dennis."\par
Tibb\cf1 l\cf0 e leaned close to her and whispered, "There's something you're going to learn about me, honey. I don't give up. Ever."\par
She watched him walk away, and wondered: \i Cou\cf1 l\cf0 d he be the one?\par
\i0 At\lang1024  12:30,\lang1033  Ashley put her computer in suspend mode and headed for \cf1 Margherita\cf0  \cf1 di\cf0  Roma, where she was joining her father for lunch.\par
\par
She sat at a corner table in the crowded restaurant, watching her father come toward her. She had to admit that he was handsome. People were turning to stare at him as he walked to Ashley\cf1 's\cf0  table. \i "How does it feel to have a famous father?"\par
\i0 Years earlier, Dr. \cf1 Steven\cf0  \cf1 Patterson\cf0  had pioneered a breakthrough in \cf1 minimally\cf0  invasive heart surgery. He was constantly invited to lecture at major hospitals around the world. Ashley\cf1 '\cf0 s mother had died when Ashley was twelve, and she had no one b\cf1 u\cf0 t her father.\par
"Sorry I'm late, Ashley." He leaned over and kissed \cf1 h\cf0 er on the c\cf1 h\cf0 eek. \par
"That's all right. I just got here." \par
He sat down. "Have you seen \i Time\i0  magazine?"\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\lang1033\i0\f0 "Yes. \cf1 Shane\cf0  showed it to me." \par
He \cf1 frowned.\cf0  "Shane? Your boss?" \par
"He's not my boss. He's\lang1024 -\lang1033 he's one of the supervisors."\par
"It's never good to mix business with pleasure, Ashley. You're seeing him socially, aren't you? That's a mistake."\par
 "Father, we're just good\lang1024 -\cf1 "\par
\cf0\lang1033 A waiter came up to the table. "Would you like to see a menu?"\par
Dr. Patterson turned to him and snapped, "Can't you see we're in the middle of a conversation? Go away until you're sent for."\par
"I\lang1024 -\lang1033 I'm sorry." The waiter turned and hurried off. Ashley cringed with embarrassmen\cf1 t.\cf0  She had forgotten how savage her father's temper was. He had once punched an inte\cf1 rn\cf0  during an operation for making an error in judgment. Ashley remembered the screaming arguments between her mother and father when she was a little girl. They had terrified her. Her parents had always fought about the same thing, but try as s\cf1 h\cf0 e might, Ashley could not remember what it was. She had blocked it from her mind.\par
Her father went on, as tho\cf1 u\cf0 gh there had been no interruption. "Where were we? Oh, yes. Going o\cf1 u\cf0 t with Shane Miller is a mistake. A big mistake." And his words brought back another terrible memory.\par
\par
She co\cf1 u\cf0 ld hear her father's voice saying, "Going out with Jim \cf1 Cleary\cf0  is a mistake. A big mistake\lang1024 ..." \lang1033 Ashley had just turned eighteen and was living in\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\cf0\i0\f0 Bedford, Pennsylvania, where she was bo\cf1 rn\cf0 . Jim \cf1 Cleary \cf0 was the most popular boy in Bedford Area High School. He was on the football team, was handsome and amusing and had a killer smile. It seemed to \cf1 Ashley\cf0  that every girl in school wanted to sleep with him. \i And most of them probably have,\i0  she had thought, wryly. When Jim Cleary started asking Ashley out, she was determined not to go to bed with him. She was sure he was interested in her only for sex, but as time went on, she changed her mind. She liked being with him, and he seemed to genuinely enjoy her company.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj That winter, the senior class went for a weekend skiing trip in the mountains. Jim Cleary loved to ski. \par
"We'll have a great time," he assured Ashley. \par
"I'm not going."\par

"I hate cold weather. Even with gloves, my fingers get numb." \par
"But it will be fun to\lang1024 -\cf1 "\par
"\cf0\lang1033 I'm not going."\par
And he had stayed in Bedford to be with her. \par
They shared the same interests and had the same ideals, and they always had a wonderful time together.\par
When Jim Cleary had said to Ashley, "Someone asked me this morning if you're my \cf1 girlfriend.\cf0  What shall I tell him?" Ashley had smiled and said, "Tell him yes."\par
\par
Dr. \cf1 Patterson\cf0  was worried. "You're seeing too much of that Cleary boy." \par
"Father, he's very decent, and I love him."\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\lang1033\i0\f0 "How can you love him? He's a \cf1 goddamned\cf0\i  football \i0 player. I'm not going to let you marry a football player. He's not good enough for you, Ashley."\par
He had said that about every boy she had gone out with.\par
Her father kept making disparaging rema\cf1 r\cf0 ks about Jim Cleary, but the explosion occurred on the night of the high school graduation. Jim Cleary was taking Ashley to an evening graduation party. When he came to pick her up, she was \cf1 sobbing. \par
\cf0 "What's the matter? What's happened?" \par
"My\lang1024 -\lang1033 my father told me he's taking me away to London. He's registered me in\lang1024 -\lang1033 in a college there."\par
Jim Cleary looked at her, stunned. "He's doing this because of us, isn't he?" \par
Ashley \cf1 nodded,\cf0  miserable. \par
"When do you leave?" \par
"Tomorrow."\par
"No! Ashley, for God's sake, don't let him do this to us. Listen to me. I want to marry you. My uncle offered me a really good job in Chicago with his advertising agency. We'll run away. Meet me tomorrow morning at the railroad station. There's a train leaving for Chicago at seven \scaps a.m. w\scaps0 ill you come with me?"\par
She looked at him a long moment and said softly, "Yes."\par
\par
Thinking about it later, Ashley could not remember what the graduation party was like. She and Jim had spent the entire evening excitedly discussing their plans. \par
"Why don't we fly to Chicago?" Ashley asked.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0\i0\f0 "Because we would have to give our names to the airline. If we go by train, nobody will know where we've gone."\par
As they were leaving the party, Jim \cf1 Cleary\cf0  asked softly, "Would you like to stop off at my place? My folks are out of town for the weekend."\par
\cf1 Ashley\cf0  hesitated, torn. "Jim... we've waited this long. A few more days won't matter."\par
"You're right." He \cf1 grinned.\cf0  "I may be the only man on this continent ma\cf1 r\cf0 rying a virgin."\par
\par
When Jim Cleary brought Ashley home from the party, Dr. \cf1 Patterson\cf0  was waiting, in a rage. "Do you have any idea how late it is?" \par
"I'm sorry, sir. The party\lang1024 -\cf1 " \par
\cf0\lang1033 "Don't give me any of your \cf1 goddamn\cf0  excuses, Cleary. Who the hell do you think you're fooling?" \par

\cf0 "From now on, you keep your \cf1 goddamned\cf0  hands off my daughter, do you understand?" \par

\cf0 "Get up to your room." \par
"Sir\cf1 -"\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i I'm not going to let my father do this to me,\i0  Ashley thought, \cf1 determinedly.\cf0  \i He's trying to ruin my life.\i0  She sat on her bed for a long time. \i Jim is my future. I want to be with him. I don\cf1 't\cf0  belong here anymore.\i0  She rose and began to pack an overnight bag. Thirty minutes later, Ashley slipped out the back door and started toward Jim Cleary's home, a dozen blocks away. \i I'll stay with him tonight, and we'll take the morning train to Chicago. \i0 But as she got nearer to his house, Ashley thought\cf1 .\cf0  \i No. This is wrong. I don't want to spoil everything. I'll meet lam at the station. \par
\i0 And she turned and headed back home.\par
\par
Ashley was up the rest of that night thinking about her life with Jim and how wonderful it was going to be. At \lang1024 5:30,\lang1033  she picked up her suitcase and moved silently past the closed door of her father's bedroom. She crept o\cf1 u\cf0 t of the house and took a bus to the railroad station. When s\cf1 h\cf0 e reached the station, Jim had not arrived. She was early. The train was not due for another hour. Ashley sat on a bench eagerly waiting. She thought about her father awakening and finding her gone. He would be furious.\par
\i But I can't let him live my life. One day he'll really get to know Jim, and he'll see how lucky I am.\lang1024  6:30\cf1 ... \cf0 6:40\cf1 ...\cf0  6:45\cf1 ...\cf0  6:50\cf1 ...\cf0\lang1033\i0  There was still no sign of Jim.

She waited another half hour and tried to telephone Jim again. When there was still no answer, she slowly headed home, desolate.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj At noon, Ashley and her father were on a plane to London.\cf1\lang1024 ...\par
\cf0\lang1033\par
She had attended a college in London for two years, and when Ashley decided s\cf1 h\cf0 e wanted to be involved in working with computers, she applied for the prestigious \cf1 MEI\cf0  \cf1 Wang\cf0  Scholarship for Women in Engineering at the University of California at Santa Cruz. She had been accepted, and three years later, she was recruited by the Global Computer Graphics Corporation.\par
In the beginning, Ashley had written half a dozen letters to Jim \cf1 Cleary,\cf0  but she had to\cf1 rn\cf0  them all up. His actions and his silence had told her only too clearly how he felt about her.\par
\par
Her father's voice jarred Ashley back to the present.\par
"You're a million miles away. What are you thinking about?"\par
Ashley studied her father across the table. "Nothing." \par
Dr. \cf1 Patterson\cf0  signaled the waiter, smiled at \cf1 h\cf0 im genially and said, "We're ready to look at menus now."\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\lang1033\i0\f0 It was only when Ashley was on her way back to the office that she remembered she had forgotten to congratulate her father on his cover of \i Time\i0  magazine.\par
When Ashley walked up to her desk, Dennis Tibb\cf1 l\cf0 e was waiting for her. \par
"I hear you had lunch with yo\cf1 u\cf0 r father." \par
\i He's an eavesdropping little creep. He m\cf1 ak\cf0 es it his business to know everything that's going on here.\i0  "Yes, I did."\par
"That can't have been much f\cf1 u\cf0 n." He lowered his voice. "Why don't you ever have lunch with me?" \par
"Dennis\lang1024 .\cf1 ..\cf0\lang1033  I've told you before. I'm not interested." \par
He \cf1 grinned.\cf0  "You will be. Just wai\cf1 t\cf0 " \par
There was something eerie about him, somet\cf1 h\cf0 ing scary. She wondered again whet\cf1 h\cf0 er he could be t\cf1 h\cf0 e one who\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  She shook her head. \i No.\i0  S\cf1 h\cf0 e had to forget about it, move on.\par
\par
On her way home, Ashley stopped and par\cf1 k\cf0 ed \cf1 h\cf0 er car in front of the Apple Tree Book House. Bef\cf1 o\cf0 re she went in, she studied the reflection in t\cf1 h\cf0 e storefront mirror to see if there was anyone behind \cf1 h\cf0 er whom she recognized. No one. She went inside the store.\par
A young male clerk walked up to her. "May I help you?"\par
"Yes. I\lang1024 -\lang1033  Do you have a book on \cf1 stalkers?" \par
\cf0 He was looking at her strangely. \i "Stalkers?" \par
\i0 Ashley felt like an idiot. She said quickly, "Yes. I also want a book on\lang1024 -\cf1\lang1033 er\cf0\lang1024 -\lang1033 gardening and\lang1024 -\lang1033 and animals of Africa." \par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0\i0\f0 "That's right," she said firmly. \par
\i Who knows? Maybe \cf1 someday\cf0  I'll have a garden and I'll ta\cf1 k\cf0 e a trip to Africa.\par
\i0 When \cf1 Ashley\cf0  retu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed to the car, it began to rain again. As she drove, the rain beat against the windshield, fracturing space and turning the streets ahead into \cf1 surreal pointillistic\cf0  paintings. She tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed on the windshield wipers. They began to sweep across the window, hissing, "He's \cf1 gonna\cf0  get you\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  \cf1 gonna\cf0  get you\lang1024 .\cf1 ..\cf0\lang1033  \cf1 gonna\cf0  get you.\lang1024 ..."\lang1033  Hastily, Ashley turned them off. \i No,\i0  she thought. \i They're saying, "No one's there, no one's there, no one's there."\par
\i0 She tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed the windshield wipers on again. "He's gonna get you\lang1024 .\cf1 ..\cf0\lang1033  gonna get you\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  gonna get you...\cf1\lang1024 ."\par
\cf0\lang1033\par
Ashley parked her car in the garage and pressed the button for the elevator. Two minutes later, she was heading for her apartment. She reached the front door, put the key in the lock, opened the door and froze. Every light in the apartment had been turned on.\par

"Yes, Mother."\i0  And Toni would sing it again and again, under her breath. That had been long ago, but the memory of defying her mother still gave her a glow.\par
\par
Toni Prescott hated working at Global Computer Graphics. She was twenty-two years old, \cf1 impish,\cf0  vivacious, and daring. She was half smoldering, half \cf1 firecracker.\lang1024\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0\i0\f0 Her face was \cf1 puckishly\cf0  heart shaped, her eyes were a mischievous brown, her figure alluring. She had been bo\cf1 rn\cf0  in London and she spoke with a delightful British accen\cf1 t\cf0  She was athletic and loved sports, particularly winter sports: s\cf1 i\cf0 ding and \cf1 bobsledding\cf0  and ice-skating.\par
\par
Going to college i\cf1 n\cf0  London, \cf1 Toni\cf0  had dressed conservatively during the day, but at night, she had donned miniskirts and \cf1 disco\cf0  gear and made the swinging rounds. She had spent her evenings and nights at the Electric \cf1 Ballroom\cf0  on \cf1 Camden\cf0  High Street, and at \cf1 Subterania\cf0  and the Leopard Lounge, mixing with the \cf1 trendy\cf0  West End crowd. She had a beautiful voice, sultry and sensuous, and at some of the clubs, she would go to the piano and play and sing, and the patrons would cheer her. That was when she felt most alive.\par
The routine inside the clubs would always follow the same patte\cf1 rn\cf0 :\par
"Do you know you're a fantastic singer, Toni?" \par
\cf1 "Ta." \par
\cf0 "Can I buy you a drink?" \par
She smiled. "A \cf1 Pimm's\cf0  would be lovely." \par
"My pleasu\cf1 r\cf0 e."\par
And it would end the same way. Her date would lean close to her and whisper in her ear, "Why don't we go up to my flat and have a shag?"\par
"Buzz off." And Toni would be out of there. She would lie in her bed at night, thinking about how stupid men were and how bloody easy it was to control them. The poor sods did not know it, but they \i wanted\i0  to be controlled. They \i needed\i0  to be controlled.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0\lang1033\i0\f0 And then came the move from London to \cf1 Cupertino.\cf0  In the beginning, it had been a disaster. Toni hated Cupertino and she loathed working at Global Computer Graphics. She was bored with hearing about plug-ins and \cf1 dpi's \cf0 and halftones and grids. She desperately missed the exciting \cf1 nightlife\cf0  of London. There were a few \cf1 nightspots \cf0 in the Cupertino area, and Toni frequented those: San Jose Live or P. \cf1 J.\cf0  \cf1 Mulligan's\cf0  or Hollywood Junction. She wore tight-fitting miniskirts and tube tops with open-toed shoes having five-inch heels or platform shoes with thick cork soles. She used a lot of makeup\lang1024 -\lang1033 thick, dark eye-liner, false eyelashes, colored eye shadow and bright lipstick. It was as though she were trying to hide her beauty.\par
\par
Some weekends, Toni would drive up to San Francisco, where the real action was. She haunted the restaurants and clubs that had music bars. She would visit Harry \cf1 Denton's\cf0  and One Market restaurant and the California Cafe, and during the evening, while the musicians took their break, Toni would go to the piano and play and sing. The customers loved it. When Toni tried to pay her dinner bills, the owners would say, "No, this is on the house. You're wonderful. Please come back again."\par
\i Did you hear that\cf1 ?\cf0  Mother? "You're wonderful. Please come back again."\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj Toni\cf0  rose and walked across the room to the piano. She sat down and began to play and sing an early Cole Porter number. When she was finished, there was enthusiastic applause. She sang two more songs and returned to her table.\par
A bald, middle-aged man came up to her. "Excuse me. May I join you for a moment?"\par
Toni started to say no, when he added, "I'm Norman \cf1 Zimmerman.\cf0  I'm producing a road company of \i The King and\lang1024  I.\lang1033\i0  I'd like to talk to you about it."\par
Toni had just read a glowing article about him. He was a theatrical genius.\par

"I work at a computer company." \par

\i If I did explain, he wouldn't understand,\i0  Toni thought miserably. \i No one would. It's the unholy curse I have to live with. Forever.\par
\i0\par
A few months after Toni started working at Global Computer Graphics, she learned about the Internet, the worldwide open door to meeting men.\par
She was having dinner at the Duke of Edinburgh with \cf1 Kathy\cf0  \cf1 Healy,\cf0  a friend who worked for a rival computer company. The restaurant was an authentic pub from England that had been to\cf1 rn\cf0  down, packed in containers and shipped to California. Toni would go there for Cockney fish and chips, prime ribs with Yorkshire pudding, \cf1 bangers\cf0  and mash and English sherry trifle. \i One foot on t\cf1 il\cf0 e ground,\i0  she would say.\lang1024  \i I \lang1033 have to remember my roots.\par
\i0 Toni looked up at Kathy. "I want you to do me a favor." \par
"Name it."\par
"I want you to help me with the Inte\cf1 rn\cf0 et, \cf1 luv.\cf0  Tell me how to use it."\par
"Toni, the only computer I have access to is at work, and it's against company policy to\lang1024 -\cf1 "\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0\i0\f0 "Sod company policy. You know how to use the Inte\cf1 rn\cf0 et, don't you?" \par
"Yes."\par
\cf1 Toni\cf0  patted \cf1 Kathy\cf0  \cf1 Healy's\cf0  hand and smiled. "Great." The following evening, Toni went to Kathy Healy's office, and Kathy introduced Toni to the world of the Inte\cf1 rn\cf0 et. After clicking on the Internet icon, Kathy entered her password and waited a moment to connect, then double clicked another icon and entered a chat room. Toni sat in amazement, watching rapid, typed conversations taking place among people all over the globe.\par
"I've got to have that!" Toni said. "I'll get \cf1 a\cf0  computer for my flat. Would you be an angel and set me up on the Internet?"\par
"Sure. It's easy. All you do is click your mouse into the \cf1 URL\cf0  field, the uniform resource locator, and\lang1024 -\cf1 " \par
\cf0\lang1033 "Like the song says, \cf1 '\cf0 Don't tell me, show me\cf1 .\lang1024 "\par
\cf0\lang1033\par
The next night, Toni was on the Internet, and from that time on, her life changed. She was no longer bored. The Inte\cf1 rn\cf0 et became a magic carpet that flew her all over the world. When Toni got home from work, she would immediately turn on her computer and go on-line to explore various chat rooms that were available.\par
It was so simple. She accessed the Internet, pressed a key and a window opened on the screen, split into an upper portion and a lower portion. Toni typed in "Hello. Is anyone there?"\par
The lower portion of the screen flashed the words "Bob. I'm here. I'm waiting for you." \par
She was ready to meet the world.\par

"Why don't you let me cheer you up? What are the chances of our meeting?" \par

\par
There was Paul, in South Africa: \par

"I'm here. I'm dying to know all about you, Paul." \par
"I'm thirty-two. I'm a doctor at a hospital in Johannesburg. I-"\par
Toni angrily signed off. \i A doctor!\i0  Terrible memories came flooding through her. She closed her eyes a moment, her heart pounding. She took several deep breaths. \i No more tonight,\i0  she thought, shakily. She went to bed.\par
\par
The following evening, Toni was back on the Internet. On-line was \cf1 Sean\cf0  from Dublin: \par
"Toni... That's a pretty name." \par
"Thank you, Sean." \par
"Have you ever been to Ireland?" \par
"No."\par

"I'm a bartender. I-" \par
Toni ended the chat session.\par
\par
Every night was different. There was a polo player in Argentina, an automobi\cf1 l\cf0 e salesman in Japan, a department store clerk in Chicago, a television technician in New York. The Internet was a fascinating game, and Toni enjoyed it to the fullest. She could go as far as she wanted and yet know that she was safe because she was anonymous.\par
And then one night, in an on-line chat room, she met Jean Claude Parent. \par
\cf1\i "Bon\cf0  \cf1 soir.\cf0\i0  I am happy to meet you, Toni." \par
"Nice to meet you, Jean Claude. Where are you?" \par
"In Quebec City."\par
"I've never been to Quebec. Would I like it?" Toni expected to see the word \i yes\i0  on the screen.\par
Instead, Jean Claude typed, "I do not know. It depends on what kind of person you are."\par
Toni found his answer intriguing. "Really? What kind of person would I have to be to enjoy Quebec?"\par
"Quebec is like the early North American frontier. It is very French. \cf1 Quebecois\cf0  are independent. We do not like to take orders from anyone." \par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj Looking at the typed words appearing on her screen, Toni could almost feel Jean Claude's enthusiasm. "It sounds great. Tell me about yourself."\par
\cf1\i "Moi?\cf0\i0  There is not much to tell. I am thirty-eight years old, unmarried. I just ended a relationship, and I would like to settle down with the right woman. \cf1\i Et\cf0  \cf1 vous? \cf0\i0 Are you married?"\par
Toni typed back, "No. I'm looking for someone, too. What do you do?"\par
"I own a little jewelry store. I hope you will come and visit it one day." \par
"Is that an invitation?" \par
\cf1\i "Mais\cf0  \cf1 oui.\cf0\i0  Yes."\par
Toni typed in, "It sounds interesting." And she meant it. \i Maybe I'll find a way to go there,\i0  Toni thought. \i Maybe he's the person who can save me.\par

Toni communicated with Jean Claude Parent almost every night. He had scanned in a picture of himself, and Toni found herself looking at a ve\cf1 r\cf0 y attractive, intelligent-looking man.\par

Ashley was a \cf1 stick-in-the-mud\cf0  who liked to stay home at night and read a book or watch the History Channel or \cf1 CNN.\cf0  She had no interest in sports. \i Boring!\i0  She had never entered a chat room.

\i0 Toni thought about how much her mother would have hated the Inte\cf1 rn\cf0 et. But then her mother had hated everything. She had only two means of communicating: screaming or whining.

Alette Peters was twenty years old. She could be plain-looking, attractive or stunningly beautiful, depending on her mood or how she was feeling about herself. But she was never simply pretty. Part of her charm was that she was completely unaware of her looks. She was shy and\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sl-260\slmult0\qj\cf0\i0\f0 soft-spoken, with a gentleness that was almost an anachronism.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf1 Alette\cf0  had been bo\cf1 rn\cf0  in Rome, and she had a musical Italian accent. She loved everything about Rome. She had stood at the top of the Spanish Steps and looked over the city and felt that it was hers. When she gazed at the ancient temples and the giant Colosseum, she knew she belonged to that era. She had strolled in the Piazza \cf1 Navona,\cf0  listened to the music of the waters in the Fountain of the Four Rivers and walked the Piazza \cf1 Venezia,\cf0  with its wedding cake monument to Victor \cf1 Emanuel.\cf0  She had spent endless hours at St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican Museum and the \cf1 Borghese\cf0  Gallery, enjoying the timeless works of Raphael and \cf1 Fra\cf0  \cf1 Bartolommeo\cf0  and \cf1 Andrea\cf0  del \cf1 Sarto\cf0  and \cf1 Pontormo.\cf0  Their talent both transfixed her and frustrated her. She wished she had been bo\cf1 rn\cf0  in the sixteenth century and had known them. They were more real to Alette than the passers-by on the streets. She wanted desperately to be an artist.\par
She could hear her mother's dark brown voice: \i "You're wasting paper and paint. You have no talent.\lang1024  \cf1 "\par
\cf0\lang1033\i0\par
The move to California had been unsettling at first. Alette had been conce\cf1 rn\cf0 ed as to how she would adjust, but \cf1 Cupertino\cf0  had tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed out to be a pleasant surprise. She enjoyed the privacy that the small town afforded, and she liked working for Global Computer Graphics Corporation. There were no major art galleries in Cupertino, but on weekends, Alette would drive to San Francisco to visit the galleries there.\par

"Don't you care about art?" \par
Toni laughed. "Sure. What's his last name?"\par
\par
There was only one cloud hanging over Alette Peters' life. She was \cf1 manic-depressive.\cf0  She suffered from \cf1 anomie,\cf0  a feeling of alienation from others. Her mood swings always caught her unaware, and in an instant, she could go from a blissful euphoria to a desperate misery. She had no control over her emotions.\par
Toni was the only one with whom Alette wo\cf1 u\cf0 ld disc\cf1 u\cf0 ss her problems. Toni had a solution for everything, and it was usually: "Let's go and have some fun!"\par
\cf1 Toni's\cf0  favorite subject was \cf1 Ashley\cf0  \cf1 Patterson.\cf0  She was watching \cf1 Shane\cf0  Miller talking to Ashley.\par
"Look at that \cf1 tight-assed\cf0  bitch," Toni said contempt\cf1 u\cf0 ously. "She's the ice queen."\par
Alette \cf1 nodded.\cf0  "She's very serious. Someone should teach her how to laugh."\par
Toni snorted. "Someone should teach her how to fuck."\par
\par
One night a week, Alette would go to the mission for \cf1 t\cf0 he homeless in San Francisco and help serve dinner. There was one little old woman in particular who looked forwa\cf1 r\cf0 d to Alette\cf1 's\cf0  visits. She was in a \cf1 wheelchair,\cf0  and Alette would help her to a table and bring her hot food.\par
The woman said gratefully, "Dear, if I had a daughter, I'd want her to be exactly like you."\par
\pard\brdrt\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 \brdrb\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 \nowidctlpar\cf1\i\f1 30 * Sidney Sheldon\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i0\f0 Alette\cf0  squeezed her hand. "That's such a g\cf1 r\cf0 eat compliment. Thank you." And her inner voice said\cf1 .\cf0  \i If you had a daughter, she'd look li\cf1 k\cf0 e a pig li\cf1 k\cf0 e you.\i0  And Alette was horrified by her thoughts. It was as though someone else inside her was saying those words. It happened constantly.\par
She was out shopping with Betty Hardy, a woman who was a member of Alette\cf1 's\cf0  church. They stopped in \cf1 f\cf0 ront of a department store. Betty was admiring a dress in the window. "Isn't that beautiful\cf1 ?'"\par
\cf0 "Lovely," Alette said. \i That's the ugliest dress I've ever seen. Pe\cf1 rfect\cf0  for you.\par
\i0 One evening, Alette had dinner with Ronald, a sexton at the church. "I really enjoy being with you, Alette. Let's do this more often."\par
She smiled \cf1 shyly.\cf0  "I'd like that." And she thought, \cf1\i Non faccia,\cf0  lo \cf1 stupido.\cf0  Maybe in another lifetime, creep. \i0 And again she was horrified. \i What's wrong with me? \i0 And she had no answer.\par
The smallest slights, whether intended or not, drove Alette into a rage. Driving to work one morning, a car cut in front of her. She \cf1 gritted\cf0  her teeth and thought, \i I'll kill you, you bastard.\i0  The man waved apologetically, and Alette smiled sweetly. But the rage was still there.\par
\par
When the black cloud descended, Alette would imagine people on the street \cf1 h\cf0 aving \cf1 h\cf0 eart attacks or being struck by automobiles or being mugged and killed. S\cf1 h\cf0 e would play the scenes out in her mind, and they were vividly real. Moments later, she would be filled with shame.\par

\par
Eve\cf1 r\cf0 y Sunday morning, Alette went to church. The ch\cf1 urch\cf0  had volunteer programs to feed the homeless, to t\cf1 e\cf0 ach after-school art lessons and to tutor students. Alette would lead children's Sunday sc\cf1 h\cf0 ool classes and \cf1 h\cf0 elp in \cf1 the\cf0  nursery. She volunteered for all of the charitable activities and devoted as much time as she could to them. S\cf1 h\cf0 e particularly enjoyed giving painting classes for the young.\par
One Sunday, the church had a fair for a \cf1 fund-raiser, \cf0 and Alette brought in some of her own paintings for the church to sell. The pastor, Frank \cf1 Selvaggio,\cf0  looked at them in amazement.\par
"These are\lang1024 -\lang1033 These are brilliant\cf1 !\cf0  You should be selling them at a gallery."\par
Alette \cf1 blushed.\cf0  "No, not really. I just do them for fun."\par
\cf1\par
\cf0 The fair was crowded. The \cf1 churchgoers\cf0  had brought t\cf1 h\cf0 eir friends and families, and game booths as well as \cf1 arts-and-crafts\cf0  booths had been set up for their enjoyment. There were beautifully decorated cakes, incredible handmade quilts, \cf1 homemade\cf0  jams in beautiful jars, carved wooden toys. People were going from booth to booth, sampling the sweets, buying things they would have no use for the next day.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0\i0\f0 "But it's in the name of charity," \cf1 Alette\cf0  heard one woman explain to her husband.\par
Alette looked at t\cf1 h\cf0 e paintings that she had placed around the booth, most of them landscapes in bright, vivid col\cf1 o\cf0 rs that leaped from the canvas. She was filled with misgivings. \i "You're wasting good money on paint, child."\par
\i0 A man came up to the booth. "Hi, the\cf1 r\cf0 e. Did you paint these?" \par
His voice was a deep blue.\par
\i No, stupid. Michelangelo dropped by and painted them. \par
\i0 "You're very talented." \par
"Thank you." \i What do you know about talent? \par
\i0 A young couple stopped at Alette\cf1 's\cf0  booth. "Look at those colors! I have to have that one. You're really good."\par
And all afte\cf1 rn\cf0 oon people came to her booth to buy her paintings and to tell her how much talent she had. And Alette wanted to believe them, but each time the black c\cf1 u\cf0 rtain came down and she thought\cf1 .\cf0  \i They're all being cheated.\par
\i0 An art dealer came by. "These are really lovely. You should merchandise your talent."\par
"I'm just an amateur," Alette insisted. And she refused to discuss it any further.\par
At the end of the day, Alette had sold every one of her paintings. She gathered the money that people had paid her, put it in an envelope and handed it to Pastor Frank \cf1 Selvaggio.\par

When Alette was in San Francisco, she spent hours visiting the Museum of Modem Art, and she haunted the \cf1 De\cf0  Young Museum to study their collection of American art.\par
Several young artists were copying some of the paintings on the museum's walls. One young man in partic\cf1 u\cf0 lar caught Alette\cf1 '\cf0 s eye. He was in his late twenties, slim and blond, with a strong, intelligent face. He was copying Georgia \cf1 O'Keeffe's\cf0  \i Petunias,\i0  and his wo\cf1 r\cf0 k was remarkably good. The artist noticed Alette watching him. "Hi." \par
His voice was a warm yellow. \par
"Hello," Alette said shyly\cf1 .\par
\cf0 The artist \cf1 nodded\cf0  toward the painting he was working on. "What do you think?"\par
\cf1\i "Bellissimo.\cf0\i0  I think it's wonderful." And she waited for her inner voice to say\cf1 .\cf0  \i For a stupid amateur.\i0  But it didn't happen. She was surprised. "It's really wonderful."\par
He smiled. "Thank you. My name is Richard, Richard Melton."\par
"Alette Pete\cf1 r\cf0 s."\par
"Do you come here often?" Richard asked. \par

\cf1 Alette\cf0  hesitated only a momen\cf1 t.\cf0  \cf1 "Va\cf0  \cf1 bene.\cf0  I'd like that." \i Not-"You look stupid" or "I don't have lunch with strangers," but-"I'd like that.\lang1024  \cf1 "\cf0\lang1033\i0  It was a new, exhilarating experience for Alette.\par

"I've never been to Rome," he said. "Maybe one day."\par
And Alette thought, \i It would be fun to go to Rome with you.\par
\i0 As they were finishing their lunch, Richard saw his roommate across the room and called him over to the table. "Gary, I didn't know you were going to be here. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Alette Peters. Gary King."\par
Gary was in his late twenties, with bright blue eyes and hair down to his shoulders. \par

They watched Gary leave. Richard said, "Alette..."\par
"Yes?"\par
"May I see you again?" \par
"I would like that." \i Very much\i0 .\par
\par
Monday morning, Alette told \cf1 Toni\cf0  about her experience. "Don't get involved with an artist," Toni warned. "You'll be living on the fruit he paints. Are you going to see him again?"\par
Alette smiled. "Yes. I think he likes me. And I like him. I really like him."\par
\par
It started as a small disagreement and ended up as a ferocious argumen\cf1 t\cf0  Pastor Frank was retiring after forty years of service. He had been a very good and caring pastor, and the congregation was sorry to see him leave. There were secret meetings held to decide what to give him as a \cf1 going-away\cf0  presen\cf1 t\cf0  A watch\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  money\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  a vacation\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  a painting\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  He loved art.\par
"Why don't we have someone do a portrait of him, with the church in the background?" They turned to Alette. "Will you do it?" \par
"Of course," she said happily. \par
Walter Manning was one of the senior members of the church and one of its biggest contributors. He was a very successful businessman, but he seemed to resent\par

Alette\cf0  went to work. The painting took her five days, and it was a masterpiece, glowing with the compassion and goodness of her subject. The following Sunday, the group met to look at the paintings. There were exclamations of appreciation over Alette\cf1 '\cf0 s painting.\par
"It's so real, he could almost walk off the canvas..\cf1\lang1024 .."\par

\cf0\lang1033 "That should be in a museum, Alette..\lang1024 .." \par
\lang1033 Walter Manning unwrapped the canvas painted by his daughter. It was a competent painting, but it lacked the fire of Alette\cf1 '\cf0 s portrait.\par

"But, Walter\cf1 -"\par
\cf0 "No, sir. This has to be unanimous. We're either giving him my daughter's painting or we don't give him anything at all."\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj There were Mystery Village evenings and live theater and the Great Pumpkin Festival. \cf1 Ashley\cf0  smiled at the thought of the good times she had had there. \i Maybe I will go back,\i0  she thought. \i Jim \cf1 Cleary\cf0  won't have t\cf1 h\cf0 e\cf1  \cf0 nerve to show up.\par

Ashley told \cf1 Shane\cf0  Miller of her decision. "It's a week \cf1 I \cf0 from Friday," she said. "I'll be back Sunday night."\par
"Grea\cf1 t.\cf0  Let me know what time you're getting back. I'll pick you up at the airport." \par
"Thank you, Shane."\par

When Ashley retu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed f\cf1 ro\cf0 m lunch, she walked into her work cubicle and tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed her computer on. To her surprise, a sudden hail of pixels began rolling down the screen, creating an image. She stared at it, bewildered. \cf1 T\cf0 he dots were forming a picture of her. As Ashley watched, horrified, a hand holding a butcher knife appeared at the top of the screen. The hand was racing toward her image, ready to plunge the knife into her ches\cf1 t.\par
Ashley screamed, "No!"\par
\cf0 She snapped off the monitor and jumped to her feet. Shane Miller had hurried to her side. "Ashley! What is it?" \par
She was trembling. "On the\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  the screen\lang1024 -\cf1 "\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\lang1033\i0\f0 Shane turned on the computer. A picture of a kitten chasing a ball of yarn across a green lawn appeared. \par
Shane turned to look at Ashley, bewildered. What-?" \par
"It's-it's gone," she whispered. \par
"What's gone?"\par
She shook her head. "Nothing. I-I've been under a of stress lately, Shane. I'm sorry." \par
"Why don't you go have a talk with Dr. Speakman?", Ashley had seen Dr. Speakman before. He was the company psychologist hired to counsel stressed-out computer whizzes. He was not a medical doctor, but he is intelligent and understanding, and it was helpful to be able to talk to someone. \par
"I'll go," Ashley said.\par
\cf1\par
Dr\cf0 . Ben Speakman was in his fifties, a patriarch at the \cf1 f\cf0 ountain of youth. His office was a quiet oasis at the far \cf1 e\cf0 nd of the building, relaxed and comfortable.\par
"I had a terrible dream last night," Ashley said. She closed her eyes, reliving it. "I was running. I was in a huge garden filled with flowers\'85 They had weird, \cf1 u\cf0 gly faces..\cf1\lang1024 .\cf0\lang1033  They were screaming at me..\cf1\lang1024 .\cf0\lang1033  I couldn't hear what they were saying.

"I don't know. I\lang1024 -I\lang1033  think I'm being followed\cf1 .\cf0  Dr. Speakman. It sounds crazy, but\lang1024 -I\lang1033  think someone wants to kill me."\par

"I\lang1024 -I\lang1033  have no idea." \par
"Have you \i seen\i0  anyone following you?" \par
"No." \par
"You live alone, don't you?" \par

"Are you seeing anyone? I mean \cf1 romantically?" \par

"I'll try."\par
\cf1 Shane\cf0  Miller was waiting for her. "What did Dr. \cf1 Speakman\cf0  say?"\par
Ashley managed a smile. "He says I'm fine. I've just been working too hard."\par
"Well, we'll have to do something about that," Shane said. "For openers, why don't you take the rest of the day off?" His voice was filled with concern.\par

\par
During the following week, Ashley could think of nothing but the reunion. \i I wonder if my going is a mistake? What if Jim Cleary does show up? Does he have any a how much he hurt me? Does he care? Will he even remember me\i0 ?\par
The night before Ashley was to leave for Bedford, she was unable to sleep. She was tempted to cancel her flight. I'm being silly, she thought. The past is the past.\par
\par
When Ashley picked up her ticket at the airport, she \cf1 examined\cf0  it and said, "I'm afraid there's been some \cf1 mistake.\cf0  I'm flying tourist. This is a first-class ticket."\par
"Yes. You changed it."\par
She stared at the clerk. "I what?" \par
"You telephoned and said to change it to a first-class ticket." He showed Ashley a slip of paper. "Is this your \cf1 'Credit\cf0  card number?" \par
She looked at it and said slowly, "Yes\lang1024 ..." \par
\lang1033 She had not made that phone call.\par
Ashley arrived in Bedford early and checked in at the Bedford Springs Resort. The reunion festivities did not \cf1 s\cf0 tart until six o'clock that evening, so she decided to explore the town. She hailed a taxi in front of the hotel. \par
"Where to, miss?" \par
"Let's just drive around." \par
\cf1 Hometowns\cf0  were supposed to look smaller when a\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\cf0\i0\f0 native retu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed years later, but to \cf1 Ashley,\cf0  Bedford looked larger than she had remembered. The taxi drove up and down familiar streets, passing the offices of the \i Bedford Gazette\i0  and television station \cf1 WKYE\cf0  and a dozen familiar restaurants and art galleries. The Baker's Loaf of Bedford was still there and Clara's Place, the Fort Bedford Museum and Old Bedford Village. They passed the Memorial Hospital, a graceful three-story brick building with a portico. It was there that her father had become famous.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj She recalled again the terrible, screaming fights between her mother and father. They had always been about the same thing. \i About what?\i0  She could not remember.\par
\par
At five o'clock, Ashley retu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed to her hotel room. She changed clothes three times before finally deciding on what she was going to wear. She settled on a simple, flattering black dress.\par
When Ashley entered the festively decorated gymnasium of Bedford Area High School, she found herself surrounded by\lang1024  120\lang1033  \cf1 vaguely\cf0  familiar-looking strangers. Some of her former \cf1 classmates\cf0  were completely unrecogni\cf1 z\cf0 able, others had changed little. Ashley was looking for one person: Jim \cf1 Cleary.\cf0  \i Would he have changed much? Would he have his wife with him?\i0  People were approaching Ashley.\par
"Ashley, it's Trent \cf1 Waterson.\cf0  You look great!" \par
"Thanks. So do you, Trent." \par
"I want you to meet my wife..\lang1024 .."\par

 "How is everything going, Art?"\par

"\cf0 Ashley! It's \cf1 Lenny\cf0  Holland. For God's sake, you look beautiful!"\par
"Thank you, Lenny." He had gained weight and was wearing a large diamond ring on his little finger.\par
"I'm in real estate now, doing great. Did you ever get married?" \par
Ashley hesitated. "No."\par
"Remember \cf1 Nicki\cf0  \cf1 Brandt?\cf0  We got married. We have twins." \par
"Congratulations."\par
\par
It was amazing how much people could change in ten years. They were fatter and thinner..\cf1\lang1024 .\cf0\lang1033  prosperous and downtrodden. They were married and divorced\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  parents and parentless.\cf1\lang1024 ...\par
\cf0\lang1033 As the evening wore on, there was dining and music and dancing. Ashley made conversation with her former \cf1 classmates\cf0  and caught up on their \cf1 l\cf0 ives, but her mind was on Jim Cleary. There was still no sign of him. \i He\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i0 An attractive-looking woman was approaching. "Ashley! I was \i hoping\i0  I'd see you." It was Florence \cf1 Schiffer. Ashley\cf0  was genuinely glad to see her. Florence had been one of her closest friends. The two of them found a table in the corner, where they could talk. \par
"You look great, Florence," Ashley said. \par
"So do you. Sorry I'm so late. The baby wasn't feeling well. Since I last saw you, I've gotten married and divorced. I'm going out with Mr. Wonderful now. What about you? After the graduation party, you disappeared. I tried to find you, but you'd left town."\par
"I went to London," Ashley said. "My father enrolled me in a college over there. We left here the mo\cf1 rn\cf0 ing after our graduation."\par
"I tried every way I could think of to reach you. The detectives thought I might know where you were. They were looking for you because you and Jim \cf1 Cleary\cf0  were going together." \par
Ashley said slowly, "The \cf1\i detectives\i0 ?" \par
\cf0 "Yes. The ones investigating the murder." \par
Ashley felt the blood drain from her face. "What\cf1\lang1024 ... \cf0\lang1033 murder?"\lang1024 .\cf1\par
\cf0\lang1033 Florence was staring at her. "My God! You don't know?"\par
"\i Know what\i0 ?" Ashley demanded fiercely. "What are you talking about?"\par
"The day after the graduation party, Jim's parents came back and found his body. He had been stabbed to death and\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  castrated."\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\lang1033\i0\f0 The room started to spin. Ashley held on to the edge of the table. Florence grabbed her arm.\par
"I'm\lang1024 -\lang1033 I'm sorry, Ashley. I thought you would have read about it, but of course\cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  you had left for London."\par
Ashley squeezed her eyes tightly shut. She saw herself \cf1 s\cf0 neaking out of the house that night, heading toward Jim Cleary's house. But she had turned and gone back home to wait for him in the morning. \i If only I had gone to him,\i0  Ashley thought miserably, \i he would still be alive. And all these years I've hated him. Oh, my God. Who could have killed him? Who\cf1 -?\par
\cf0\i0 She could hear her father's voice, \i "You keep your \cf1 goddamned\cf0  hands off my daughter, do you understand? \cf1\lang1024 ...\cf0\lang1033  If I ever see you around here again, I'll break every bone in your body."\par
\i0 She got to her feet. "You'll have to excuse me, Florence. I\lang1024 -\cf1\lang1033 I\cf0 'm not feeling very well." And Ashley fled.\par
The detectives. They must have gotten in touch with her father. \i Why didn't he tell me?\par
\i0 She took the first plane back to California. It was early in the morning before she could fall asleep. She had a nightmare. A figure standing in the dark was stabbing Jim and screaming at him. The figure stepped into the light. \par
It was her father.\par

She awakened slowly, knowing that something was terribly wrong. She felt as though she had been drugged. It was an enormous effort merely to open her eyes. Ashley looked around the room and began to panic. She was lying in a bed, naked, in a cheap hotel room. She managed to sit up, and her head started to pound. She had no idea where she was or how she had gotten there. There was a room service menu on the \cf1 nightstand,\cf0  and she reached over and picked it up. \i The Chicago Loop Hotel.\i0  She read it again, stunned. \i What am I doing in Chicago?

"Oh. Today is Monday. Can I\cf1 -" \cf0 Ashley replaced the receiver in a daze. \i Monday.\i0  She had lost two days and two nights. She sat up at the edge of the bed, trying to remember. She had gone to Dennis Tibble's apartment.... She had had a glass of wine....\cf1\lang1024  \cf0\lang1033 After that, everything was a blank.\par
He had put something in \cf1 h\cf0 er glass of wine that had made her temporarily lose her memory. She had read about incidents where a drug like that had been used. It was called the "date rape drug." That was what he had given her. The talk about wanting her advice had been a ruse. \i And like a fool, I fell for it.\i0  She had no recollection of going to the airport, flying to Chicago or checking into this seedy hotel room with Tibble. And worse\lang1024 - \lang1033 no recollection of what had happened in this room.\par
\i I've got to get out of here,\i0  Ashley thought desperately. She felt unclean, as though every inch of her body had been violated. What had he done to her? Trying not to think about it, she got out of bed, walked into the tiny bathroom and stepped into the shower. She let the stream of hot water pound against her body, t\cf1 r\cf0 ying to wash away whatever terrible, dirty things had happened to her. What if he had gotten her pregnant?

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj Ashley examined her purse. Only forty dollars. Her \cf1 checkbook\cf0  and credit card were still there. \i Thank God!\par

"I'll be sure to tell him."\par
\par
She sat in the lobby for almost an hour, willing the telephone to ring. People passing by stared at her or ogled her, and she felt naked in the tawdry outfit she was wearing. When the phone finally rang, it \cf1 startled\cf0  her. She hurried back into the phone booth. "Hello\cf1\lang1024 ..."\par

When Ashley got back to her apartment, she felt as though she had retu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed to a sanctuary. She could not wait to get out of the tacky outfit she was wearing.

The patrolman nodded toward the bedroom. "In there, sir." He looked pale.\par
Blake wa\cf1 l\cf0 ked to the bedroom and stopped, in shock. A man's naked body was sprawled across the bed, and Blake's first impression was that the room was soaked in blood. As he stepped closer to the bed, he saw where the blood had come from. The ragged edge of a broken bottle had punctured the victim's back, over and over\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj Looking at it, Blake felt a pain in his groin. "How\cf1  \cf0 the hell could a human being do a thing like this?" he said aloud. There was no sign of the weapon, but they would make a thorough search.\par
Deputy Blake went back into the living room to talk to the building superintendent. \cf1 "\cf0 Did you know the deceased?"\par
"Yes, sir. This is his apartment."\par
"What's his name?"\par
"Tibble. Dennis Tibble."\par
Deputy Blake made a note. "How long had he lived\cf1  \cf0 here?"\par
"Almost th\cf1 r\cf0 ee years."\par
"What can you tell me about him?"\par
"Not too much, sir. Tibble kept pretty much to himself, always paid his rent on time. Once in a while he'd have a woman in here. I think they were mostly pros."\par
"Do you know where he worked?"\par
"Oh, yes. Global Computer Graphics Corporation. He was one of them computer \cf1 nerds."\par
\cf0 Deputy Blake made another note. "Who found the body?"\cf1\lang1024\par

Ashley stood the\cf1 r\cf0 e, listening in disbelief. \i I'm going \cf1 crazy\i0 ,\cf0  she thought.\lang1024  \i This\lang1033  has nothing to do with Father. Someone else must be behind all this. B\cf1 u\cf0 t who? And why?\par

Ashley\cf0  anxiously watched the news every night, but, there still no new developments in the Dennis Tibble murder. She began to relax. If the police could not con\cf1 nect\cf0  her with the case, there was no way they could a connection to her father. Half a dozen times she ste\cf1 eled\cf0  herself to ask him about it, but each time she backed off. What if he were innocent? Could he ever forgive her for accusing him of being a murderer? \i And if he is guilty, I don't want to know,\i0  Ashley thought.\lang1024  \i I co\cf1\lang1033 uldn't\cf0  bear it.

\i0\par
\cf1 Ashley\cf0  telephoned her father in San Francisco. She said, \cf1 without\cf0  preamble, "I'm not going to be able to spend Christmas with you this year, Father. My company is sending me to a convention in Canada." \par

Alette\cf0  was excited. She said to \cf1 Toni,\cf0  "I've never been to Quebec City. Do they have museums there?"\par

Toni and Jean Claude had lunch together every day, and every afternoon, Jean Claude took Toni on a tour. She had never seen any place like Quebec City. It was like finding a \cf1 turn-of-the-century\cf0  picturesque French village in North America. The ancient streets had colorful names like Break Neck Stairs and Below the Fort and Sailor's Leap. It was a \cf1 Currier\cf0\lang1024  &\lang1033  I\cf1 ves\cf0  city, framed in snow.\par
They visited La \cf1 Citadelle,\cf0  with its walls protecting Old Quebec, and they watched the traditional changing of the guard inside the walls of the fort.

Jean Claude took \cf1 Toni\cf0  \cf1 snowmobiling\cf0  in the countryside. As they raced down a narrow slope, he called out, \cf1 "\cf0 Are you having a good time?"\par
Toni sensed that it was not an idle question. She \cf1 nodded\cf0  and said softly, "I\cf1 '\cf0 m having a wonderful time."\par
\cf1\par
Alette\cf0  spent her time at museums. She visited the Basilica of \cf1 Notre-Dame\cf0  and the Good Shepherd Chapel and the Augustine Museum, but she had no interest in anything else that Quebec City offered. There we\cf1 r\cf0 e dozens of gourmet restaurants, but when she was not dining at t\cf1 h\cf0 e hotel, she ate at \cf1 Le\cf0  Commensal, a vegetarian cafeteria.\par
\cf1 F\cf0 rom time to time, Alette thought about her artist friend, Richard Melton, in San Francisco, and wondered what he was doing and if he would remember her.\par

Ashley\cf0  was dreading Christmas. She was tempted to call her father and tell him not to come. \i But what excuse can I give? You're a murderer. I don't want to see you? \par
\i0 And each day Christmas was coming closer.\par

"I would like to show you my jewelry store," Jean Claude told Toni. "Would you care to see it?" \par

"I am, too," Toni said softly. \par
The music began. Jean Claude looked at Toni. "Would you like to dance?" \par
"I'd love to."\par
Dancing was one of Toni\cf1 's\cf0  passions, and when she got out on the dance floor, she forgot everything else. \i She was a little girl dancing with her father, and her mother said, "The child is clumsy."\par

He pulled over to the curb and stepped out to investigate. He walked to the front door and called, \cf1\i "Bon\cf0  \cf1 soir.\cf0  \cf1 Y\cf0  \cf1 a-t-il,\cf0  \cf1 quelqu'un?"\par

\i0 There was no response. The house was unnaturally quiet. Unbuttoning his g\cf1 u\cf0 n holster\cf1 ,\cf0  Officer Picard began to go through the downstairs rooms, calling out as he moved from room to room. The only response was an eerie silence. He returned to the foyer. There was a graceful staircase leading to the floor above. \cf1 "Allo!" \cf0 Nothing.\par
Officer Picard started up the stairs. When he got to the top of the stairs, his gun was in his hand. He called out again, then started down the long hallway. Ahead, a bedroom door was ajar. He walked over to it, opened it wide and turned pale. \cf1\i "Mon\cf0  \cf1 Dieu!"\par

\cf0 "How was Quebec City?"\par
"It was very interesting," \cf1 Ashley\cf0  said. "It's a beautiful place."\par

And this was a doctor, a man dedicated to saving lives. \i I'll never understand him,\i0  Ashley thought.\lang1024  \cf1\i I\cf0\lang1033  don't think I want to.\par

"Fantastic!" She was delighted. And she could not help thinking\cf1 .\cf0  \i It's so different when I'm with him.

"What would you like?" Richard asked. "They have great roast beef here."\par
"I'm a vegetarian. I'll just have a salad. Thank you."\par
"Okay."\par
A young, attractive waitress came over to the table. "Hello, Richard." \par

Unexpectedly, Alette felt a pang of jealousy. Her reaction surprised her. \par
"Are you ready to order?"\par
"Yes. Miss Peters is going to have a salad, and I'm going to have a roast beef sandwich."\par

"One day I want to go to \cf1 Giverny,"\cf0  Alette said, "where Monet painted."\par
"Did you know Monet started out as a caricaturist?" \par
"No."\par
"It's true. Then he met \cf1 Boudin,\cf0  who became his\cf1\lang1024 ;\cf0\lang1033  teacher and persuaded him to start painting out of doors. There's a great story about that. Monet got so hooked on painting out of doors that when he decided to paint a picture of a woman in the garden, with a canvas over e\cf1 ight\cf0  feet high, he had a trench dug in the garden so he c\cf1 ould\cf0  raise or lower the canvas by pulleys. The picture \cf1 is\cf0  hanging at the \cf1 Musee\cf0  \cf1 d'Orsay\cf0  in Paris." \par
The time went by swiftly and happily.\par
\cf1\par
After\cf0  lunch, Alette and Richard walked around looking at the various exhibits. There were more than forty thousand objects in the collection, everything from ancient Egyptian \cf1 artifacts\cf0  to contemporary American paintings.\par
Alette was filled with the wonderment of being with Richa\cf1 r\cf0 d and her complete lack of negative thoughts. \cf1\i Che cosa\cf0  \cf1 significa?\par

Alette looked at \cf1 Richard.\cf0  "You are?" \par
Richard said modestly, "Oh, I'm just guiding him little bi\cf1 t.\cf0 "\par
"He's doing more than that, miss. I've always \cf1 wanted \cf0 to be a painter. That's why I took this job at the \cf1 museum \cf0 because I love art. Anyway, Richard comes here and paints.

"Whatever you say. I'll see you next weekend?" \par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj They were an attractive couple, obviously very much in love. David Singer was in his early thirties, blond and intelligent-looking, with an engaging boyishness about him. His wife, \cf1 Sandra,\cf0  was lovely looking and warm.\par
Robert \cf1 Crowther\cf0  had noticed the bulge around her stomach and had said, "The second guest room would be perfect for a nursery. There's a playground a block away and two schools in the neighborhood." He had watched them exchange that secret smile again.\par
The duplex penthouse consisted of an upstairs master bedroom with a bath and a guest room. On the first floor was a spacious living room, a dining room, a library, a kitchen, a second guest bedroom and two bathrooms. Almost every room had a view of the city.\par
Robert watched the two of them as they walked through the apartment again. They stood in a corner whispering.\par
"I love it," Sandra was saying to David. "And it would be great for the baby. But, darling, can we afford it? It's six hundred thousand dollars!"\par
"Plus maintenance," David added. "The bad news is that we can't afford it today. The good news is that we're going to be able to afford it on Thursday. The genie is coming out of the magic bottle, and our lives are going to change."\par
"I know," she said happily. "Isn't it wonderful!"\par

Crowther smiled benevolently. "Take all the time you want, Mrs. Singer. It's yours."\par

Out of a possible twenty-five candidates, six would be chosen to enter the ra\cf1 r\cf0 efied air of the firm's partnership, and everyone agreed that David was one of those who would be \cf1 s\cf0 elected. Kincaid, Turner, Rose & Ripley, with offices in San Francisco, New York, London, Paris and Tokyo, was one of the most prestigious law firms in the world, and it was usually the number one target for graduates of all the top law schools.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj The firm used the \cf1 stick-and-carrot\cf0  appr\cf1 o\cf0 ach on their young associates. The senior partners took merciless advantage of them, disregarding their hours and illnesses and handing the younger lawyers the donkey's work that \cf1 t\cf0 hey themselves did not want to be \cf1 bothered\cf0  with. It was a heavy pressure, \cf1 twenty-four-hour-a-day\cf0  job. That was the stick. Those who stayed on did so because of the carro\cf1 t.\cf0  T\cf1 h\cf0 e carrot was the promise of a partnership in the firm. Becoming a partner meant a larger salary, a piece of the huge corporate-profit pie, a spacious office with a view, a private \cf1 washroom,\cf0  assignments overseas and myriad other perks.\par
David had practiced corporate law with Kincaid, Turner, Rose & Ripley for six years, and it had been a mixed blessing. The hours were horrific and the stress was enormous, but David, determined to hang in there for the partnership, had stayed and had done a brilliant job. Now the day was finally at hand.\par
\par
When David and \cf1 Sandra\cf0  left the real estate agent, they went shopping. They bought a bassinet, \cf1 highchair,\par

"There's plenty of time for that." Sandra laughed. After shopping, they wandered around the city, walking along the \cf1 waterfront\cf0  at \cf1 Ghirardelli\cf0  Square, past the Cannery to Fisherman's Wharf. They had lunch at the American Bistro.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj It was Saturday, a perfect San \cf1 F\cf0 rancisco day for \cf1 monogrammed\cf0  leather briefcases and power ties, da\cf1 r\cf0 k suits and discreetly \cf1 monogrammed\cf0  shirts, a day for power lunches and penthouses. A lawyer's day.\par

David and Sandra had met three years ear\cf1 l\cf0 ier at a small dinner party. David had gone to t\cf1 h\cf0 e party wit\cf1 h\cf0  the daug\cf1 h\cf0 ter of a c\cf1 l\cf0 ient of the firm. Sandra was a paralegal, working for a rival firm. At dinn\cf1 e\cf0 r, Sandra and David had gotten into an argument about a decision that had been rendered in a political case in Washington. As the others at the dinner table watched, the argument between the two of them had become more and more heated. And in the middle of it, David and Sandra realized that neither of them cared about the court's decision. They were showing off for each other, engaged in a verbal mating dance.\par
David telephoned Sandra the next day. "I'd like to finish discussing that decision," David said. "I think it's important."\par
"So do I," Sandra agreed. "Could we talk about it at dinner tonight?" Sandra hesitated. She had already made a dinner date\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj They were together from that night on. One year from the day they met, they were married.\par
Joseph \cf1 Kincaid,\cf0  the firm's senior partner, had given David the weekend off.\par
\par
David's sala\cf1 r\cf0 y at Kincaid, Tu\cf1 rn\cf0 er, Rose & \cf1 Ripley\cf0  was $45,000 a year. \cf1 Sandra\cf0  kept her job as a paralegal. But now, with the baby coming, their expenses were about to go up.\par
"I'll have to give up my job in a few months," Sandra said. "I don't want a nanny bringing up our baby, darling. I want to be here for him." The \cf1 sonogram\cf0  had shown that the baby was a boy.\par
"We'll be able to handle it," David assured her. The partnership was going to transform their lives.\par
David had begun to put in even longer hours. He wanted to make sure that he was not overlooked on partnership day.\par
\par
Thursday morning, as David got dressed, he was watching the news on television.\par
An \cf1 anchorman\cf0  was saying breathlessly, "We have a breaking story...\cf1 .\cf0  \cf1 Ashley\cf0  \cf1 Patterson,\cf0  the daughter of the prominent San Francisco doctor \cf1 Steven\cf0  Patterson, has been arrested as the suspected serial killer the police and the FBI have been searching for...."

He was twenty-one years old and just starting law school. He came home from class one day to find his mother on the bedroom floor, unconscious. He called 911, and an ambulance took his mother to San Francisco Memorial Hospital. David waited outside the emergency room until a doctor came to talk to him. "Is she-Is she going to be all right?" The doctor hesitated. "We had one of our \cf1 cardiologists\cf0  examine her. She has a ruptured cord in her mitral valve."\par
"What does that mean?" David demanded. "I'm afraid there's nothing we can do for her. She's too weak to have a transplant, and mini heart surgery is new and too risky."\par
David felt suddenly fain\cf1 t\cf0  "How-how long can she\cf1 -?"\par
\cf0 "I'd say a few more days, maybe a week. I'm sorry, son."\par
David stood there, panicky. "Isn't there \i anyone\i0  who can help her?"\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i0\f0 David went to visit his mother in intensive care that evening.\par
"You can only stay a minute," a nurse warned him. "She's very weak."\par
David stepped inside the room, and his eyes filled with tears. His mother was attached to a respirator with tubes running into her arms and through her nose. S\cf1 h\cf0 e looked whiter than the sheets she lay on. Her eyes were closed.\par
David moved close to her and said, "It's me\cf1 ,\cf0  Mom. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. You're going to be fine." Tears were running down his cheeks. "Do you hear me? We're going to fight this thing. Nobody can lick the two of us, not as long as we're together. I'm going to get you the best doctor in the world. You just hang in there. I'll be back tomorrow." He bent down and gently kissed her cheek. \i Will she be alive tomorrow?\par

The following afte\cf1 rn\cf0 oon, David went to the garage in the basement of the building where Dr. Patterson had his offices. An attendant was pa\cf1 r\cf0 king cars. He came up to David. "May I help you?"\par
"I'm waiting for my wife," David said. "She's seeing Dr. Patterson." The attendant smiled. "He's a great guy."\par
"He was te\cf1 l\cf0 ling us about some fancy car that he owns." David paused, trying to remember. "Was it a \cf1 Cadillac?" \cf0 The attendant shook his head. \cf1 "No."\cf0  He pointed to\par

"Wo\cf1 u\cf0 ldn't surprise me," the attendant \cf1 s\cf0 aid. He hurried off to park an incoming car.\par
David walked casually toward the Rolls. When he was sure no one was watching, he opened the door, slipped into the backseat and got down on the floor. He lay there, cramped and uncomfortable, willing Dr. \cf1 Patterson\cf0  to come ou\cf1 t\par
\cf0 At 6:15, David felt a slight jar as the front door of the car opened and someone moved into the driver's sea\cf1 t. \cf0 He heard the engine start, and t\cf1 h\cf0 en the car began to move. "Good night\cf1 .\cf0  Dr. Patterson."\par
"Good night, \cf1 Marco."\par
\cf0 The car left the garage, and David felt it tu\cf1 rn\cf0  a corner. He waited for two minutes, then took a deep breath and sat up.\par
Dr. Patterson saw him in the \cf1 rearview\cf0  mirror. He said calmly, "If this is a holdup, I have no cash with me."\par
"Turn onto a side street and pull over to the curb." Dr. Patterson \cf1 nodded.\cf0  David watched warily as the doctor turned the car onto a side street, pulled over to the curb and stopped.\par

Today was the day. Finally. \i "Mr. Kincaid would like \cf1 t\cf0 o see you in his office at five o'clock..\cf1 ..\cf0  You're at the top of the list."\par
\i0 He was tempted to telephone \cf1 Sandra\cf0  with the news. Something held him back. \i I'll wait until it happens,\i0  he thought.\par

Dr. Patterson rose. "Thank you." David watched him walk out the door.\par

Because I made a mistake, and an innocent woman I loved is dead. I swore I would never take anyone's life in my hands again. Ever. \par

\i0 David pressed down the intercom button. "Holly, would you ask Mr. \cf1 Kincaid\cf0  if he can see me now?"\par
"Yes, sir."\par

Thirty minutes later, David was walking into the elaborate offices of Joseph Kincaid. Kincaid was in his sixties, a gray monochrome of a man, physically, mentally and emotionally.\par

"I know you didn't. Someone's made an awful mistake, but we're going to straighten everything out."\par

Ashley looked at him \cf1 f\cf0 or a full minute, and when she spoke, she said in a quiet voice, "I told you the truth. I have nothing more to say."\par
Listening to her, David thought\cf1 .\cf0  \i She really believes what she's saying. I'm talking to a nut case. What am I going to tell \cf1 Jesse\cf0  \cf1 Quiller? \cf0\i0 "Would you talk to a psychiatrist?"\par
"I don't-Yes. If you want me to."\par
"I'll ar\cf1 ra\cf0 nge it." On his way back to San Francisco, David thought, \cf1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\f0 I kept my end of the bargain. I talked to her. If she really thinks she's telling the truth, then she's cra\cf1 z\cf0 y. I'll get her to Jesse, who will plead insanity, and that will be the end of it. \par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i0 His heart went out to \cf1 Steven\cf0  Patterson.\par
\par
At San Francisco Memorial Hospital, Dr. Patterson was receiving the condolences of his fellow doctors.\par
"It's a damn shame, Steven. You s\cf1 u\cf0 re don't deserve anything like this...\cf1 ."\par
\cf0 "It must be a terrible burden for you. If there's anything I can do\cf1 ..."\par
\cf0 "I don't know what gets into kids these days. Ashley always seemed so normal.\cf1 ..."\par
\cf0 And behind eac\cf1 h\cf0  expression of condolence was the thought: Thank God it's not my kid.\par
\par
When David \cf1 returned\cf0  to the law firm, he hurried in to \cf1 s\cf0 ee Joseph \cf1 Kincaid.\par
Kincaid\cf0  look\cf1 e\cf0 d up and said, "Well, it's after six o'clock, David, but I waited for you. Did you see Dr. Patterson\cf1 '\cf0 s da\cf1 u\cf0 ghter?"\par
"Yes, I did."\par
"And did you find an attorney to defend her?" David hesitated. "Not yet, Joseph. I'm arranging for a psychiatrist to see her. I'll be going back in the mo\cf1 rn\cf0 ing to ta\cf1 l\cf0 k to her again."\par
Joseph Kincaid looked at David, pu\cf1 z\cf0 zled. "Oh? Frankly, I'm surprised that you're getting this involved. Naturally, we can't have this fir\cf1 m\cf0  associated with anything as ugly as this trial is going to be."\par

"There's nothing in writing, is there?"\par
"No."\par
"So it's only a moral obligation?" David studied him a moment, started to say something, then stopped. "Yes. It's only a moral obligation."\par
"Well, when you're through with Miss \cf1 Patterson, \cf0 I come back and we'll talk." \par
Not a word about the partnership.\par
\par
When David got home that evening, the apartment was in darkness. \par
\cf1 "Sandra?"\par
\cf0 There was no answer. As David started to turn on the lights in the hallway, Sandra suddenly appeared from the kitchen, ca\cf1 r\cf0 rying a cake with lit candles.\par
"Surprise! We're having a celebration-\cf1 "\cf0  She saw the look on David's face and stopped. "Is something wrong, darling? Didn't you get it, David? Did they give it to someone else?"\par
"No, no," he said \cf1 reassuringly.\cf0  "Everything's fine." Sandra put down the cake and moved closer to him. "Something's wrong."\par
"It's j\cf1 u\cf0 st that there's been a\cf1 ...\cf0  a delay."\par
"Wasn't yo\cf1 u\cf0 r meeting with Joseph \cf1 Kincaid\cf0  today?"\par
"Yes. Sit down, honey. We have to talk." They sat down on the couch, and David said, "Something unexpected has come \cf1 u\cf0 p. \cf1 Steven\cf0  Patterson came to see me t\cf1 h\cf0 is morning."\par

\cf0 "I know. I tried to tell him that. But I \i have\i0  practiced criminal law."\par
"But you're not doing that anymore. Did you tell him you're about to become a partner in your firm?"\par
"No. He was very insistent that I was the only one who could defend his daughter. It doesn't make any sense, of course I tried to suggest someone like \cf1 Jesse Quiller,\cf0  but he wouldn't even listen."\par
"Well, he'll have to get someone else."\par
"Of course. I promised to talk to his daughter, and I did."\par
Sandra sat back on the couch. "Does Mr. Kincaid know about this?"\par
"Yes. I told him. He wasn't thrilled." He mimicked \cf1 Kincaid's\cf0  voice. \cf1 "\cf0  \cf1 '\cf0 Naturally, we can't have this firm associated with anything as ugly as this trial is going to be\cf1 .'"\par
\cf0 "What's Dr. \cf1 Patterson's\cf0  daughter like?"\par
"In medical terms, she's a fruitcake."\par
"I'm not a doctor," Sandra said. "What does that mean?"\par
"It means that she really believes she's innocen\cf1 t.\cf0 "\par
"Isn't that possible?"\par
"The sheriff in \cf1 Cupertino\cf0  showed me the file on her. Her \cf1 DNA\cf0  and fingerprints are all over the murder scenes."\par
"What are you going to do now?"\par
"I've called \cf1 Royce\cf0  \cf1 Salem.\cf0  He's a psychiatrist that Jesse \cf1 Quiller's\cf0  office uses. I'm going to have him \cf1 ex\cf0 amine.\cf1\par

\cf1 Sandra\cf0  said brightly, "He will. Tomorrow's another day."\par
\par
Dr. \cf1 Royce\cf0  \cf1 Salem\cf0  was a tall, thin man with a \cf1 Sigmund \cf0 Freud beard.\par
\i Maybe that's just a coincidence,\i0  David told himself. \i Surely he's not trying to look like Freud.\par
\cf1\i0 "Jesse\cf0  talks about you of\cf1 t\cf0 en," Dr. Salem said. "He's very fond of you."\par
"I'm fond of him\cf1 .\cf0  Dr. Salem."\par
"T\cf1 h\cf0 e Patterson case sounds very interesting. Obviously the work of a psychopath. You're planning an insanity plea?"\par
"Actually," David told him, "I'm not handling the case. Before I get an attorney for her\cf1 .\cf0  I'd like to get an evaluation of her mental state." David \cf1 briefed\cf0  Dr. Salem on the facts as he knew them. "She claims she's innocent, but the evidence s\cf1 h\cf0 ows she committed the crimes."\par
"Well, let's have a look at the lady's psyche, shall we?"\par
\par
The \cf1 hypnotherapy\cf0  session was to take place in the Santa Clara County Jail, in an interrogation room. The \cf1 furniture\cf0  \cf1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj Ashley, looking pale and drawn, was led into the room by a matron.\par
"I'll wait outside," the matron said, and withdrew. David said, "Ashley, this is Dr. Salem. Ashley Patterson."\par
Dr. Salem said, "Hello, Ashley." She stood there, nervously looking from one to the other, without speaking. David had the feeling that she was ready to flee the room.\par
"Mr. Singer tells me that you have no objection to being hypnotized." Silence.\par
Dr. Salem went on. "Would you let me hypnotize you, Ashley?"\par
Ashley closed her eyes for a second and \cf1 nodded. \cf0 "Yes."\par
"Why don't we get started?"\par
"Well, I'll be running along," David said. "If\cf1 -"\par
"\cf0 Just a moment." Dr. Salem walked over to David. "I want you to stay."\par
David stood there, frustrated. He regretted now that he had gone this far. \i I'm not going to get in any deeper, \i0 David resolved. \i This will be the end of it.\par
\i0 "All right," David said reluctant\cf1 l\cf0 y. He was eager to have it over with so he could get back to the office. The coming meeting with Kincaid loomed large in his mind.\par
Dr. Salem said to Ashley, "Why don't you sit i\cf1 n\cf0  this chair?" Ashley sat down.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0\i0\f0 "Have you ever been hypnotized before, \cf1 Ashley?" \cf0 She hesitated an instant, then shook her head. "No."\par
"There's nothing to it. All you have to do is relax and listen to the sound of my voice. You have nothing to worry about. No one's going to hurt you. Feel your muscles relax. That's it. Just relax and feel your eyes getting heavy. You've been through a lot. Your body is tired, very tired. All you want to do is to go to sleep. Just close your eyes and relax. You're getting very sleepy.\cf1 ..\cf0  very sleepy...."\par
It took ten minutes to put her under. Dr. \cf1 Salem\cf0  walked over to Ashley. "Ashley, do you know where you are?"\par
"Yes. I'm in jail." Her voice sounded hollow, as though coming from a distance. "Do you know why you're in jail?"\par
"People think I did something bad."\par
"And is it true? Did you do something bad?"\par
"No."\par
"Ashley, did you ever kill anyone?"\par
"No."\par
David looked at Dr. Salem in surprise. \i Weren't people supposed to tell the truth under hypnosis?\par
\i0 "Do you have any idea who could have committed those murders?"\par
Suddenly, \cf1 Ashley's\cf0  face contorted and she began breathing hard, in short, \cf1 raspy\cf0  breaths. The two men watc\cf1 h\cf0 ed in astonishment as her persona started changing. Her Ups tightened and her features seemed to s\cf1 h\cf0 ift. She sat up straight, and t\cf1 h\cf0 ere was a sudden live\cf1 l\cf0 iness in her face.

Dr. Salem exchanged a look with David, then turned back to Ashley. "If you're not Ashley, who are you?"\par
"\cf1 Toni.\cf0  \cf1 Toni\cf0  Prescott."\par
\i And Ashley is doing this with a straight face,\i0  David \cf1 t\cf0 ho\cf1 u\cf0 gh\cf1 t\cf0  \i How long is she going to go on with this stupid charade?\i0  She was\fs18  \fs24 wasting their time\fs18 . \par

\cf0\i0 David was watching in bewildermen\cf1 t. \par
\cf0 "Toni?" Dr. \cf1 Salem\cf0  edged closer. \par
The soft voice said, "I apologize for the interruption, Dr. Salem." \par
Dr. Salem asked, "Who a\cf1 r\cf0 e you?"\par
"I am \cf1 Alette.\cf0  \cf1 Alette\cf0  Peters." \par

Dr. Salem said, "I'm going to bring her out of it." \par
David was perspiring. "Yes." \par
Dr. Salem leaned close to Ashley. "Ashley.\cf1 ..\cf0  Ashley.\cf1 ..\cf0  Eve\cf1 r\cf0 ything is fine. Close your eyes now. They're very heavy, very heavy. You're completely relaxed.

It's been in the psychiatric literature for more than two hundred years. It usually starts because of a childhood trauma. The victim shuts out the trauma by creating another identity. Sometimes a person will have dozens of different personalities or alters."\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj "And they know about each other?"\par
"Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. \cf1 Toni\cf0  and \cf1 Alette \cf0 know each other. Ashley is obviously not aware of either of them. Alters are created because the host can't stand the pain of the trauma. It's a way of escape. Every time a fresh shock occurs, a new alter can be born. The psychiatric literature on the subject shows that alters can be totally different from one another. Some alters are stupid, while others are brilliant. They can speak different lang\cf1 u\cf0 ages. They have varied tastes and personalities."\par
"How-how common is this?"\par

"\cf0 It's when one or more personalities-or alters-exist in a person and take control from time to time, and that person is not aware of it. Your daughter has multiple personality disorder."\par

"I listened to Ashley while Dr. \cf1 Salem\cf0  had her under hypnosis. She has two alters. At various times, they possess her." David was talking more rapidly now. "The sheriff showed me the evidence against your daughter. There's no doubt that she committed the murders."\par

"No. Because I don't believe she was aware \cf1 t\cf0 hat she committed the murders. She was under the influence of one of \cf1 t\cf0 he alters. Ashley had no reason to commit those\par

Jesse Quiller was one of the top criminal defense attor\cf1 n\cf0 eys in the country. He was a tall, rugged man with a homespun touc\cf1 h\cf0  that made jurors identify with him. They felt that he was one of \cf1 t\cf0 hem, and they wanted to help him. That was one of the reasons he seldom lost a case. The other reasons were that he had a photographic memory and a brilliant mind.\par

When David graduated, \cf1 Quiller\cf0  invited him to join his criminal law firm, and two years later, David had become a partner. David loved practicing criminal law and excelled at it. He made sure that at least 10 percent of his cases were pro \cf1 bono.\cf0  Three years after becoming a partner, David had abruptly \cf1 r\cf0 esigned and gone to \cf1 work\cf0  for \cf1 Kincaid,\cf0  Turner, Rose & \cf1 Ripley\cf0  to practice \cf1 corporate\cf0  law.\par

Over the years, David and \cf1 Quiller\cf0  had remained close \cf1 f\cf0 riends. They, and their wives, had dinner together once a week.\par
\cf1 Jesse\cf0  Quiller had always fancied tall, sylphlike, sophisticated blondes. Then he had met Emily and fallen in love with her. Emily was a prematurely gray dumpling of a woman, from an Iowa farm-t\cf1 h\cf0 e exact opposite of other women Quiller had dated. She was a caretaker, m\cf1 o\cf0 ther earth. They made an unlikely couple, but the marriage worked because they were deeply in love with each o\cf1 t\cf0 her.\par

Helen Woodman was a lovely young woman accused of murdering her wealthy stepmother. There had been bitter public quarrels between the two, but all the evidence against Helen was circumstantial. After David had gone to the jail and met with her, he was convinced she was innocent. With each meeting, he had become more emotionally involved. In the end, he had broken a basic ru\cf1 le:\cf0  Never fall in love with a client.\par
The trial had gone well. David had refuted the prosecutor's evidence bit by bit, and he had won the jury over to his client's side. And unexpectedly, a disaster had occurred. Helen's alibi was that at the time of the murder she had been at t\cf1 h\cf0 e theater with a friend. Under questioning in court, her friend admitted that the alibi was a lie, and a witness had come forward to say that he had seen Helen at her stepmother's apartment at the time of the murder. Helen's credibility was completely gone. The jury convicted her of first-degree murder, and the judge sentenced her to be executed. David was devastated.\par
"How could you have done this, Helen?" he demanded. "Why did you lie to me?"\par
"I didn't kill my stepmother, David. When I got to her apartment, I found her on the floor, dead. I was afraid\par

"Are you?" He tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed and stormed out. Sometime during the night, Helen committed suicide. One week later, an ex-convict caught committing a burglary confessed to the murder of Helen's stepmother.\par

When David left \cf1 Kincaid's\cf0  office, he went to see \cf1 Steven Patterson.\cf0  He had telephoned ahead, and the doctor was waiting for him. \par
"Well, David?"\par
\i My answer is going to change my life,\i0  David thought. \i And not for the better.\i0  "I'm going to defend your daughter, Dr. Patterson."\par
Steven Patterson took a deep breath. "I knew it I would have bet my life on it." He hesitated a momen\cf1 t. \cf0 "I'm betting my daughter's life on it."\par

\cf0 Dr. Patterson got to his feet. "I don't want to hear anything more about Jesse Quiller or any of the rest of them. I know trial lawyers, David. They're interested in the money and the publicity. This isn't about money or publicity. This is about \cf1 Ashley."\par
\cf0 David started to speak, then stopped. There was nothing he could say. \cf1 T\cf0 he man was fanatic on the subject. \cf1\par

\cf0 Dr. Patterson studied him a moment then nodded. "Quid pro quo?"\par
"Quid pro quo." David managed a smile. "Do you drive?"\par
"David, if you're on a leave of absence, you'll need some expense money to keep you going. I insist."\par
"As you wish," David said. \par
\i At least we'll eat during the trial.\par

Jesse Quiller was waiting for David at Rubicon. \par

\cf0 "Yes, you can." \cf1 Quiller\cf0  \cf1 grinned.\cf0  "Yo\cf1 u\cf0 'll find a way to pay me back. You always pay people back, don't you, and Saint David?" He picked up a menu. "I'm starved." He looked up. "By the way, lunch is on you."\par
\par
David went to visit \cf1 Ashley\cf0  in the Santa Clara Co\cf1 u\cf0 nty Jail. \par
"Good morning, Ashley."\par
"Good morning." She looked even paler than usual. "Father was here this morning. He told me that you're going to get me out of here."\par
\i I wish I were that optimistic,\i0  David thought. He said carefully, "I'm going to do everything I can, Ashley.

\par
When David got home that evening, \cf1 Sandra\cf0  gave him a hug and said, "Did I ever tell you how pro\cf1 u\cf0 d I am of you?"\par
"Because I'm out of a job?" David asked. \par
"That, too. By the way, Mr. \cf1 Crowther\cf0  called. The real estate broker. He said the papers are ready to sign. They want the down payment of sixty thousand dollars. I'm afraid we'll have to tell him we can't affo\cf1 r\cf0 d-\cf1 "\par

"An hour isn't enough time," David told her.\par
She put her arms around him and murmured, "Why don't you get undressed, Tiger?"\par
"What?" He pulled back and looked at her, worried. "What abo\cf1 u\cf0 t the-What does Dr. Bailey say?"\par
"The doctor says if you don't get undressed in a hurry, I should attack you."\par
David \cf1 grinned.\cf0  "His word's good enough for me."\par
\par
The following morning, David moved into the back office of \cf1 Jesse\cf0  \cf1 Quiller's\cf0  suite. It was a serviceable office, part of a five-office suite.\par
"We've expanded a little since you were here," Jesse explained to David. "I'm sure you'll find everything. The law libra\cf1 r\cf0 y is next door; you've got faxes, computers, everyt\cf1 h\cf0 ing you need. If there's anything you don't see, just ask."\par
"Thanks," David said. "I-I can't tell you how much I appreciate this, Jesse."\par
Jesse smiled. "Yo\cf1 u\cf0 're going to pay me back. Remember?"\par
\cf1 Sandra\cf0  arrived a few minutes later. \cf1 "\cf0 I'm ready," she said. "Where do we begin?"\par
"We begin by looking up every case we can find on multiple personality trials. There's probably a ton of stuff on \cf1 di\cf0 e Inte\cf1 rn\cf0 et.

David shook his head. "She's much too fragile. The prosecution would tear her apart." He looked up at Sandra. "This is going to be a hard one to win."\par
Sandra smiled. "But you're going to win it. I know you are."\par
\par
David put in a call to Harvey \cf1 Udell,\cf0  the accountant at \cf1 Kincaid,\cf0  Tu\cf1 rn\cf0 er, Rose & \cf1 Ripley. \par
\cf0 "Harvey. David Singer."\par

"That's an interesting case you're taking on. The papers are full of i\cf1 t.\cf0  What can I do for you?"\par
David said, "I have sixty thousand dollars in my pension plan there, Harvey. I wasn't going to take it out this \cf1 early,\cf0  but Sandra and I just bought a penthouse, and I'm going to need the money for a down payment."\par
"A penthouse. Well, congratulations."\par

Harvey \cf1 Udell\cf0  replaced the \cf1 r\cf0 eceiver and then picked up the telephone again. "Tell Mr. \cf1 Kincaid\cf0  I'd like to see him."\par

Thirty min\cf1 u\cf0 tes later he was in Joseph Kincaid\cf1 's\cf0  office. "What is it, Harvey?"\par
"I got a call from David Singer, Mr. Kincaid. He's bought a penthouse, and he needs the sixty thousand he has in his pension fund for a down payment. In my opinion, we're not obligated to give him the money now. He's on leave, and he's not-\cf1 "\par

Ashley\cf0  \cf1 Patterson's\cf0  a\cf1 r\cf0 raignment took place in the Superi\cf1 o\cf0 r Court of \cf1 t\cf0 he County of Santa C\cf1 l\cf0 a\cf1 r\cf0 a on North First Street in San Jose. The legal wrangling about jurisdiction had gone on for weeks. It had been complicated, because the murders had taken place in two countrie\cf1 s\cf0  and two different states. A meeting was held \cf1 i\cf0 n San Francisco, attended by \cf1 O\cf0 fficer Guy \cf1 Pontaine\cf0  from the Quebec Police Department, Sheriff \cf1 Dowling\cf0  from Santa Clara County, Detective \cf1 Eagan\cf0  from Bedford, Pennsylvania, Captain \cf1 Rudford\cf0  from the San Francisco Police Department, and Roger \cf1 Toland,\cf0  the chief of police in San Jose.\par
Fontaine said, "We would like to t\cf1 r\cf0 y her \cf1 i\cf0 n Quebec because we have absolute evidence of her\cf4  \cf0 guilt. There'\cf1 s \cf0 no way she can win a trial there."\par
Detective Eagan said, "For t\cf1 h\cf0 at matter, so do we, Officer \cf1 Fontaine.\cf0  Jim Cleary's was t\cf1 h\cf0 e first murder she committed, and I t\cf1 h\cf0 ink that should take precedence over the others."\par
Captain Rudford of the San Francisco po\cf1 l\cf0 ice said, "Gentlemen, there's no doubt that we can all prove her\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\cf0\i0\f0 guil\cf1 t.\cf0  But three of these murders took place in Califo\cf1 rn\cf0 ia, and she should be tried here for a\cf1 l\cf0 l of them. That gives us a much stronger case."\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj "I agree," Sheriff \cf1 Dowling\cf0  said. "And two of them took place in Santa Clara County, so this is where t\cf1 h\cf0 e jurisdiction s\cf1 h\cf0 ould lie."\par
T\cf1 h\cf0 ey spent t\cf1 h\cf0 e next two hours arguing the merits of the\cf1 i\cf0 r positions, and in t\cf1 h\cf0 e end, it was decided that the trial for the murders of Dennis Tibb\cf1 l\cf0 e, Richard Melton and dep\cf1 u\cf0 ty Sam Blake would be held at the Hall of Justice in San Jose. They agreed that the murders in Bedford and Quebec would be put on hold.\par
\par
On the day of arraignment, David stood at \cf1 Ashley's\cf0  side. \par
The judge on the bench said, "How do you plead?"\par
"Not g\cf1 u\cf0 ilty and not guilty by reason of insanity." \par
The judge \cf1 nodded.\cf0  "Very well."\par
"Your Honor, we're requesting bail at this time." \par
The attorney from the prosecutor's office jumped in. "Your Honor, we strongly object. The defendant is accused of \cf1 th\cf0 ree savage murders and faces the death penalty. If she were given the opportunity, she would flee the country."\par
"That's not tr\cf1 u\cf0 e," David said. "The\cf1 r\cf0 e's \cf1 n\cf0 o\cf1 -" \par
\cf0 The judge interr\cf1 u\cf0 pted. "I've reviewed the file and the prosecutor's affidavit in support of no bail. Bail denied. This case is assigned to Judge Williams for all purposes. The defendant will be held in custody at t\cf1 h\cf0 e Santa Clara County Jail \cf1 u\cf0 ntil trial." \par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\par
When David returned to the office. \cf1 Sandra\cf0  said, "Have you seen the headlines? The tabloids are calling \cf1 Ashley '\cf0 the Butcher Bitch\cf1 .'\cf0  The story is all over television."\par
"We knew this was going to be rough," David said. "And this is only the beginning. Let's go to work." \par
The trial was eight weeks away.\par
\par
The next eight weeks were filled with feverish activity. David and Sandra worked all day and far into the night, digging up transcripts of trials of defendants with multiple personality disorder. There were dozens of cases. The various defendants had been tried for murder, rape, robbery, drug dealing, arson...\cf1 .\cf0  Some had been convicted, some had been acquitted.\par
"We're going to get Ashley acquitted," David told Sandra.\par
\par
Sandra gathered the names of prospective witnesses and telephoned them.\par
"Dr. \cf1 Nakamoto,\cf0  I'm working with David Singer. I believe you testified in \i The State of Oregon Versus \cf1 Bo-hannan.\cf0\i0  Mr. Singer is representing Ashley \cf1 Patterson.... \cf0 Oh, you did? Yes. Well, we would like you to come to San Jose and testify in her behalf..\cf1 .."\par
\cf0 "Dr. Booth, I'm calling from David Singer's office. He's defending Ashley Patterson. Yo\cf1 u\cf0  testified in the \cf1\i Dickerson\cf0\i0  case. We're interested in your expert \cf1 testi-\par

\cf0 And so it went, \cf1 from\cf0  morning until midnigh\cf1 t.\cf0  \cf1 F\cf0 ina\cf1 l\cf0 ly, a \cf1 l\cf0 ist of a dozen witnesses was compiled. David looked at it and said, "It's pretty impressive. Doctors, a dean.\cf1 ..\cf0  heads of law schools." He looked up at \cf1 Sandra\cf0  and smiled. "I think we're in good shape."\par
\par
Fr\cf1 o\cf0 m time to time, \cf1 Jesse\cf0  \cf1 Quiller\cf0  came into t\cf1 h\cf0 e office David was using. "How are you getting along?" he asked. "Anything can do to help?"\par
"I'm fine."\par
Quiller looked around the office. "Do you have eve\cf1 r\cf0 ything you need?"\par
David smiled. "Everything, including my best \cf1 fr\cf0 iend."\par
\par
On a Monday morning, David received a package from the pro\cf1 s\cf0 ec\cf1 u\cf0 tor's office listing the state's discovery. As David read it, his spirits sank. \par
Sandra was watching \cf1 h\cf0 im, concerned. "What is it?"\par
"Look at t\cf1 h\cf0 is. He's bringing in a lot of \cf1 h\cf0 eavyweight medical experts to testify against \cf1 MPD."\par
"\cf0 How are you going to handle that?" Sandra asked. \par
"We're going to admit that \cf1 Ashley\cf0  was at the scenes when the murders took place, but t\cf1 h\cf0 at the murders were actually committed by an alter ego." \i Can I persuade a jury to believe that?\par

\cf0 "Do you remember the Boy Scout motto,-\cf1 '\cf0 be prepared\cf1 '?"\par

"When you walk into Tessa \cf1 Williams's\cf0  \cf1 courtroom, \cf0 be prepared. S\cf1 h\cf0 e's brillian\cf1 t.\cf0  She came up t\cf1 h\cf0 e hard way.

"Interesting," David said. \par
"The trial is going to be in Santa Clara County?"\par
"Yes."\par
"Then you'll have my old friend \cf1 Mickey\cf0  \cf1 Brennan \cf0 prosecuting."\par
"Tell me about him."\par
"He's a \cf1 feisty\cf0  Irishman, tough on the inside, tough on the outside.

The s\cf1 u\cf0 perior \cf1 courthouse\cf0  in Santa Clara County is a white, four-story b\cf1 u\cf0 ilding on North First Street.

David was listening, puzzled. \par

David rented an office in San Jose close to the court-house, where he could interview his witnesses and prepare them for the trial.

They met Ashley in a holding room at the county detention center. She was trying hard to conceal her nervousness. To David, s\cf1 h\cf0 e looked like a deer trapped in the \cf1 h\cf0 eadlights of a \cf1 J\cf0 uggernaut. \par

David moved closer to \cf1 Ashley\cf0  and said, \cf1 "Toni?\cf0  Are you there, Toni? I'd like to talk to you."\par
As they watched, Ashley\cf1 's\cf0  face went through another \cf1 r\cf0 emarkable \cf1 t\cf0 ransformation. Her persona changed before their eyes. There was a new assurance, a sexual awareness. She began to sing in that clear, t\cf1 h\cf0 roaty voice:\par

"Do you believe in God? Are you a religious person, Toni?"\par

Judge Williams had been cor\cf1 r\cf0 ect about the media. The reporters were relentless. Journalists were swarming in from around t\cf1 h\cf0 e world, avid to cover the story of a beautiful young woman being tried as a serial killer who sexually mutilated her victims.\par
The fact that \cf1 Mickey\cf0  \cf1 Brennan\cf0  was forbidden to bring the names of Jim \cf1 Cleary\cf0  or Jean Claude Parent into the trial had been frustrating, but the media had solved the problem for \cf1 h\cf0 im. Television talk shows, magazines and newspapers all carried lurid stories of the five murders and castrations. Mickey Brennan was pleased.\par
\par
When David arrived at the \cf1 courtroom,\cf0  the press was out in full force. David was besieged.\par

\par
The \cf1 voir\cf0  dire started with Judge Williams asking general questions of the potential jurors. When she had finished, it was t\cf1 h\cf0 e defense's tu\cf1 rn\cf0  and t\cf1 h\cf0 en the prosecution's.\par
To laymen, the selection of a jury seems simple: \i Choose the prospective juror who seemed friendly and dismiss the others.\i0  In fact, voir dire was a carefully planned ritual. Skilled trial lawyers did not ask direct q\cf1 u\cf0 estions that would bring yes or no answers. They asked general questions that would encourage the jurors to talk and reveal something of themselves and t\cf1 h\cf0 e\cf1 i\cf0 r true fee\cf1 l\cf0 ings.\par
Mickey Brennan and David Singer had different agendas. In this case, Brennan wanted a preponderance of men on t\cf1 h\cf0 e jury, men who would be disgusted and\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\cf0\i0\f0 shocked at the idea of a woman stabbing and castrating her victims. \cf1 Brennan's\cf0  questions were meant to pinpoint people who were traditional in their thinking, who would be less likely to believe in spirits and goblins and people who claimed they were inhabited by alters.

"Her disguise is that of an innocent, vulnerable young woman. But the state will prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant willfully and knowingly murdered and mutilated three innocent men.\par
"She used an alias to commit one of these murders, hoping not to get caught. She knew exactly what she was doing. We're talking calculated, cold-blooded murder.

David walked over to the jury box, t\cf1 r\cf0 ying to forget about he\rquote s headache and fever. He spoke slowly.\par
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have listened to the prosecution ridiculing the facts of multiple personality disorder. I'm sure that Mr. \cf1 Brennan\cf0  wasn't being deliberately malicious. His statements were made out of ignorance. The fact is that he obviously knows nothing about multiple personality disorder, and the same is true of some of t\cf1 h\cf0 e witnesses he has put on the stand. But I'm going to \cf1 h\cf0 ave some people talk to you who \i do\i0  know abo\cf1 u\cf0 t it. These are reputable doctors, who are experts in this problem. When you have heard their testimo\cf1 n\cf0 y\cf1 .\cf0  I'm sure that it will cast a whole different light on what Mr. Brennan has had to say.\par
"Mr. Brennan has talked about my client's guilt in committing these te\cf1 r\cf0 rible crimes. That's a very important point. \i Guilt.\i0  For murder in the first degree to be proved, \cf1 t\cf0 here must be not only a guilty act, but also a guilty intention. I will show you that there was no guilty intention, because \cf1 Ashley\cf0  \cf1 Patterson\cf0  was not in control at the time the crimes occurred. S\cf1 h\cf0 e was totally unaware that they were taking place. Some eminent doctors are going to testify that Ashley Patterson has two additional personalities, or alters, one of them a controlling one." David looked into the faces of the jurors. They seemed\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj "The American Psychiatric Association \cf1 r\cf0 ecognizes multiple personality disorder.

One of \cf1 Ashley\cf0  \cf1 Patterson's\cf0  personalities committed murder, but it was a \i personality-\i0 an \i alter- \i0 over which she had no control." His voice was getting stronger. "To see the problem clearly, you must understand that the law does not punish an innocent person\cf1 . \cf0 So there is a paradox here. Imagine that a Siamese twin is being tried for murder. The law says that you cannot punish the guilty one because you would then have to punish the innocent one." The jury was listening intently.\par
David \cf1 nodded\cf0  toward Ashley. "In this case, we have not two but three personalities to deal with."\par

"And did you come here at my request?"\par
"No. I read about the trial, and I wanted to testify. I've worked with patients who have multiple personality disorder, and I wanted to be helpful, if I could. \cf1 MPD\cf0  is much more common than the public realizes, and I want to try to clear up any misunderstandings about i\cf1 t.\cf0 "\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj "I told you at the beginning of this trial that for someone to be convicted of first-degree murder, there has to be physical evidence and a motive.

I'm sure you'll agree that in this case, there \i is\i0  a reasonable doubt.\par

If she committed a murder and did not want to be caught, would she have been stupid enough to leave her fingerprints at each one of the scenes? The answer is no."\par
David went on for another thirty minutes. At the end, he looked at their faces and was not reassured. He sat down.\par
Judge Williams turned to the jurors. "I want to instruct you now on the applicable law to t\cf1 h\cf0 is case. I want you to listen carefully." She talked for the next twenty min\cf1 u\cf0 tes, detailing what was admissible and allowable by law.\par

David and Ashley watched as the jurors filed in and took their seats in the jury box. Ashley was stone-faced. David found that he was perspiring.\par
Judge Williams turned to the jury foreman. "Have the jurors reached a verdict?"\par
"We have\cf1 .\cf0  Your Honor."\par
"Would you please hand it to the bailiff." \par
The bailiff carried the piece of paper to the judge. Judge Williams unfolded it. There was not a sound in the \cf1 courtroom.\par
\cf0 The bailiff returned the paper to the jury foreman. "Would you read the verdict, please?" \par
In a slow, measured tone, he read, "In the case of \i The People of the State of California Versus Ashley Patterson,\i0  we, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant, Ashley Patterson, guilty of the murder of Dennis Tibb\cf1 l\cf0 e, a violation of Penal Code Section 187."\par

David was finding it difficult to breathe. He turned to Ashley, but he had no words. He leaned over and put his arms around \cf1 h\cf0 er.\par
Judge Williams said, "I would like to have the j\cf1 u\cf0 ry polled." One by one, each juror stood up. \par
"Was the verdict read, your verdict?" \par
And when each one had affirmed it, Judge Williams said, "The verdict will be recorded and entered into the reco\cf1 r\cf0 d." She went on. "I want to thank the jury for their time and service in this case. You're dismissed. Tomorrow the court will take up the issue of sanity."\par
David sat there, numb, watching Ashley being led away.\par
Judge Williams got up and wa\cf1 l\cf0 ked to her chambers without looking at David. Her attitude told David more clearly than words what her decision was going to be in the morning. Ashley was going to be sentenced to die.\par

A little later, David hurried into an antiques store.\par
The clerk approached him. "May I help you, sir?" He recognized David. "Mr. Singer."\par
"I'm lo\cf1 o\cf0 king for a fo\cf1 l\cf0 ding Chinese screen. Do you have something like that?"\par

"Let's see what you have."\par
"Certainly." He led David over to the section where there were several Chinese folding screens. The clerk pointed to the first one. "Now, this one-\cf1 "\par
"\cf0 That's fine," David said. \par
"Yes, sir. Where shall I send it?"\par
"I'll take it with me."\par
\par
David's next stop was at a hardware store, where he bought a Swiss Army knife. Fifteen minutes later, he was walking into the lobby of the \cf1 courthouse\cf0  carrying the screen. He said to the guard at the desk, "I made arrangements to interview Ashley \cf1 Patterson. I \cf0 have permission to use Judge \cf1 Goldberg's\cf0  chambers. He's not here today."\par
The guard said, "Yes, sir. It's all set. I'll have the defendant brought up. Dr. \cf1 Salem\cf0  and another man are already up there, waiting."\par
"Thank you."\par
The guard watched David carry the Chinese screen into the elevator. \i Crazy as a loon,\i0  he thought.\par
\par
Judge Goldberg's chamber was a comfortable-looking room with a desk facing the window, a swivel chair, and near one wall a couch and several ch\cf1 a\cf0 rs. Dr. Salem and another man were standing in the room when David entered. \par
"Sorry I'm late," David said.\par

\cf0 He turned to Hug\cf1 h\cf0  Iverson and pointed to a corner of the room. "How's that for you?"\par
"Fine."\par
He watched Iverson go to work. A few minutes later, the door opened and \cf1 Ashley\cf0  entered with a guard. "I'll have to stay in the room," the gua\cf1 r\cf0 d said. \par
David \cf1 nodded.\cf0  "That's all righ\cf1 t.\cf0 " He tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed to Ashley. "Sit down, please."\par
He watched her take a sea\cf1 t.\cf0  "First of all, I want to tell you how terribly sorry I am about the way things wen\cf1 t.\cf0 " \par

Seated on the bench, Judge Tessa Williams said, "Both counsels have agreed that they will accept the opinion of a psychiatrist who has already examined the defendant, Dr. Salem.

Otto \cf1 Lewison,\cf0  the superintendent of the \cf1 Connecticut \cf0 Psychiatric Hospital, was in his seventies, a neat, \cf1 dapper l\cf0 ittle man with a full bea\cf1 r\cf0 d and p\cf1 i\cf0 nce-nez glasses.\cf1\par

"Everyone's fantasy," Gilbert Keller said dryly.\par
Otto Lewison said, "We're going to keep her in security ward \cf4 A\cf0  until we can get a full evaluation."\par
"When is she arriving?" Dr. Keller asked.\par

"Yes, please." Lewison looked up. "Does that answer your question?"\par
\par
The trip had been a nightmare. At the end of her trial, Ashley \cf1 Patterson\cf0  had been taken back to her cell and held there for three days while arrangements were made to fly \cf1 h\cf0 er back eas\cf1 t.\par
\cf0 A prison bus had driven her to the airp\cf1 o\cf0 rt in Oakland, where a plane was waiting for her. It was a converted D\cf1 C\cf0 -6, part of the huge National Prisoner Transportation\par

Ashley was wearing handcuffs, and w\cf1 h\cf0 en she sat down, her feet were shackled to t\cf1 h\cf0 e bottom of the seat.\par
\i Why are they doing this to me? I'm not a dangerous criminal. \cf1 I\cf0 'm a normal woman.\i0  And a voice inside her said\cf1 .\cf0  \i Who murdered \cf1 fi\cf0 ve innocent people?\par
\i0 The prisoners on the plane were hardened criminals, convicted of murder, rape, armed robbery and a dozen other crimes. They were on their way to top security prisons around the country. Ashley was the only woman on board.\par
One of the convicts looked at her \cf1 and grinned. \cf0 "Hi, baby. How would you like to come over and warm up my lap?"\par
"Cool it," a guard warned.\par
"Hey! Don't you have any romance in your soul? This bitch ain't going to get laid for-\cf1 What's\cf0  your sentence, baby?"\par

\cf0 Another convict was staring at Ashley. "Wait a minute!" he said. "That's the broad who killed five men and castrated them." \par

That was the end of the \cf1 badgering.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj Two uniformed police officers were waiting for her on the tarmac when the plane landed. She was unshackled from the plane seat and shackled again in d\cf1 i\cf0 e interior of a police van. She had never felt so humiliated. The fact that she felt so normal made it all the more unbearable. Did they think she was going to try to escape or murder someone? All that was over, in the past. Didn't they know that? She was sure it would never happen again. She wanted to be away from there. Anywhere.\par
Sometime during the long, dreary drive to Connecticut, she dozed off. She was awakened by a guard's voice. \par
"We're here."\par

Dr. \cf1 Lewison\cf0  made the introductions and held o\cf1 u\cf0 t a chair. "Sit down, please." He looked at the guard. "Take off the handcuffs and shackles." \par
The restraints were removed, and Ashley took a seat. \par

\cf0\i0 "The therapy is nonthreatening. It will consist of a combination of sessions with Dr. \cf1 Keller\cf0 -hypnotism, group therapy, art therapy. The important thing to remember is that we're not your enemies."\par

There was nothing more to say.\par
Otto Lewison \cf1 nodded\cf0  to the attendant, and he walked over to Ashley and took her arm.\par
\cf1 Craig\cf0  Foster said, "He'll take you to your quarters now. We'll talk again later."\par
When Ashley had left the room, Otto Lewison turned to Gilbert Keller. "What do you t\cf1 h\cf0 ink?"\par

A dozen terrible thoughts flashed through \cf1 Ashley's \cf0 head. He was going to bring out her alters. She was terrified of the idea. "Please," she said. "I-I don't want to meet them."\par
"You won't," Dr. Keller assured her. "Not yet." \par
She swallowed. "All right."\par
"Are you ready?" \par
She \cf1 nodded.\cf0  "Yes."\par
"Good. Here we go."\par
It took fifteen minutes to hypnotize her. When she was under, Gilbert Keller glanced at a piece of paper on his desk. \cf1\i Toni\cf0  Prescott and \cf1 Alette\cf0  Peters.\i0  It was time for switching, the process of changing from one dominating personality state to another.\par
He looked at Ashley, asleep in her chair, then leaned forward. "Good morning, Tonni. Can you hear me?" \par
He watched Ashley's face transform, taken over by\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\cf0\i0\f0 an entirely different personality. There was a sudden vivacity in her face. She began to sing:\par

\cf0\i0 "That was very nice, \cf1 Toni.\cf0  I'm Gilbert \cf1 Keller."\par
"\cf0 I know who you are," Toni said. \par
"I'm glad to meet you. Did anyone ever tell you that you have a beautiful singing voice?"\par
"Sod off."\par
"I mean it. Did you ever take singing lessons? I'll bet you did."\par
"No, I didn't. As a matter of fact, I wanted to, but my"-\i For God's \cf1 sakes,\cf0  will you stop that terrible noise! Whoever told you you could sing?-\i0 "never mind."\par

"\cf0 Toni\cf1 ...?\cf0  Toni.\cf1 ..?" \par

Gilbert Keller looked at \cf1 Ashley's\cf0  face again. It was serene. Dr. Keller leaned forward. \par
\cf1 "Alette?" \cf0 There was no change in Ashley's expression. "Alette\cf1 ...?" \par

"Come out, Alette."\par
Ashley took a deep breath, and then there was a sudden explosion of words spoken in Italian. \par
\cf1\i "C'i\cf0  \cf1 qualcuno\cf0  \cf1 che\cf0  \cf1 parla\cf0  \cf1 Italuaw?"\par

"You've been t\cf1 hr\cf0 ough a te\cf1 r\cf0 rible time, but all that is behind you. Your future is going to be very peaceful. Do you know where you are?" \par

"Hogarth. He painted insane asylums and scenes that are terrifying." \i You're too ignorant ever to have heard of him.\par
\i0 "I don't want you to think of this place as te\cf1 r\cf0 rifying. Tell me about yourself, Alette. What do you like to do? What would you like to do while you're here?"\par

Leave me alone. \par
\cf1\i0 "Alette?"\cf0  Gilbert \cf1 Keller\cf0  watched \cf1 Ashley's\cf0  face change again.\par
Alette was gone. Dr. Keller awakened \cf1 Ashley. \par
\cf0 She opened her eyes and b\cf1 l\cf0 inked. "Have you started?"\par
"We've finished."\par
"How did I do?"\par
"\cf1 Toni\cf0  and Alette talked to me. We've made a good beginning, Ashley."\par
\par
The letter from David Singer read:\par
\par
Dear Ashley,\par
Just a note to let you know that I'm t\cf1 h\cf0 inking about you and hoping that you'\cf1 r\cf0 e making good progress. As a matter of fact, I think about you often. I feel as though we've gone through the wars together. It was a tough fight, but we won. And I have good news. I've been assured that the murder charges against you in Bedford and Quebec will be dropped. If there is anything I can do for you, let me know. \par

"I don't need your bloody help. I'm doing fine."\par
"Well, I need \i your\i0  help, Toni. I want to ask you a question. What do you think of Ashley?"\par
"Miss \i Tight \cf1 Ass? \cf0\i0  Don't get me started."\par
"You don't like her?"\par
"In spades."\par
"What don't you like about her?" \par
There was a pause. "She tries to keep eve\cf1 r\cf0 ybody from having fun. If I didn't take over once in a while, our lives would be boring. \i Boring.\i0  She doesn't like to go to parties or travel or do any fun things."\par
"But you do?"\par
"You bet I do. That's what life's all about, isn't it, \cf1 luv?"\par
\cf0 "You were bo\cf1 rn\cf0  in London, weren't you, Toni? Do you want to tell me about it?"\par
"I'll tell you one thing. I wish I were there now." \par
Silence. \par
"Toni\cf1 ...?\cf0  Toni\cf1 ...?" \par
\cf0 She was gone.\par
Gilbert Keller said to Ashley, "I'd like to speak to Alette." He watched the expression on Ashley's face change. He leaned forward and said softly, "Alette."\par

"\cf1 Toni\cf0  does not want me to."\par
"Does Toni always tell you what to do?"\par
"Toni is my friend." \i It's none of your business. \par
\i0 "I want to be your friend, \cf1 Alette.\cf0  Tell me about yourself. Where were you bo\cf1 rn\cf0 ?"\par
"I was bo\cf1 rn\cf0  in Rome."\par
"Did you like Rome?"\par
Gilbert \cf1 Keller\cf0  watched the expression on \cf1 Ashley's \cf0 face change, and s\cf1 h\cf0 e began to weep.\par
\i Why?\i0  Dr. Keller leaned forward and said \cf1 soothingly, \cf0 "It's all right. You're going to awaken now\cf1 .\cf0  Ashley..\cf1 .." \par
\cf0 She opened her eyes.\par
"I talked to Toni and Alette. They're friends. I want you all to be friends."\par
While Ashley was at lunc\cf1 h\cf0 , a male nurse walked into \cf1 h\cf0 er room and saw a painting of a landscape on the floor. He studied it a moment, then took it to Dr. \cf1 Keller's \cf0 of\cf1 fi\cf0 ce.\par
\par
There was a meeting in Dr. \cf1 Lewison's\cf0  office. \par
"How's it going, Gilbert?"\par
Dr. Keller said thoughtfully, "I've talked to the two alters. The dominant one is Toni. She has an English background and won't talk about it. The other one, Alette, was bo\cf1 r\cf0 n in Rome, and she doesn't want to talk\par
\pard\brdrt\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 \brdrb\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 \nowidctlpar\qr\i\f1 Tell Me Your Dreams * 303\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\i0\f0 about it, either. So that's where I'm going to concentrate. That's where the t\cf1 r\cf0 aumas occurred. Toni is \cf1 th\cf0 e more aggressive one. Alette is sensitive and wit\cf1 h\cf0 drawn. She's interested in painting, but she's afraid to pursue it. I \cf1 h\cf0 ave to find out why."\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj "So you think Toni dominates Ashley?"\par
"Yes. Toni takes over. Ashley wasn't aware that she exists, or for that matter, t\cf1 h\cf0 at Alette existed. But Toni and Alette know each ot\cf1 h\cf0 er. It's interesting. Toni has a lovely singing voice, and Alette is a talented painter." He held up the painting t\cf1 h\cf0 at the male nurse had brought him. "I think their talents may be the key to getting through to them."\par
\par
Ashley received a letter from her father once a week. After she read them, she would sit in \cf1 h\cf0 er room quietly, not wanting to talk to anyone.\par
"They're her only link to home," Dr. Keller said to Otto \cf1 Lewison.\cf0  "I think it increases her desire to get out of here and start leading a normal \cf1 l\cf0 ife. Every \cf1 l\cf0 ittle bit helps.\cf1 ..."\par
\cf0\par
Ashley was becoming used to her \cf1 surroundings.\cf0  T\cf1 h\cf0 e patients seemed to walk about, although there were attendants at every door and in the \cf1 corridors.\cf0  The gates to the grounds were always locked. There was a recreation room where they could gather and watch television, a gymnasium where inmates could work out and a common dining room. There were many k\cf1 i\cf0 nds of people there: Japanese, Chinese, \cf1 F\cf0 rench, Americans...\cf1 .\cf0  Every effort had been made to make the hospital as \cf1 ordinary-\par

"But Dr. \cf1 Keller\cf0  thinks he can cure Ashley. Then we can get out of here."\par
"Don't be stupid, Alette. Don't you see? The only way he can cure Ashley is to get rid of us, make us disappear. In other words, to cure her, we have to die. Well, I'm not going to let that happen."\par
"What are you going to do?"\par

"Five years."\par
"That's a long time. Do you ever feel you want to get out of here?"\par
"Sometimes, sure."\par
\cf1 Toni\cf0  lowered her voice. "You know there's nothing really wrong with me. I admit I had a little problem when I came in, but I'm cured now. I'd like to get out of here, too. I'll bet you could help me. The two of us could leave here together. We'd h\cf1 ave\cf0  a wonderful time."\par
He studied her a moment. "I don't know what to say."\par
"Yes, you do. Look how simple it would be. All you have to do is let me out of here one night when everyone's asleep, and we'll be on our way." She looked over at him and said softly, "I'll make it worth your while." \par
He \cf1 nodded.\cf0  "Let me think about i\cf1 t.\cf0 "\par

"Good morning, Toni."\par
"Hi, \cf1 Dockie."\par
\cf0 "Are you happy here, Toni?"\par
"It's funny you should ask that. To tell you the truth, I'm really beginning to like this place. I feel at ho\cf1 m\cf0 e here."\par
"Then why do you want to escape?" \par
\cf1 Toni's\cf0  voice hardened. "What?"\par
"Bill tells me that you asked him to help you escape from here."\par
"That son of a bitch!" There was fury in her voice. She flew out of the chair, ran over to the desk, picked up a \cf1 paperweight\cf0  and flung it at Dr. Keller's head. \par
He ducked.\par
"I'll kill you, and I'll kill him\cf1 !\cf0 " \par
Dr. Keller grabbed her. "Toni\cf1 -" \par

"Ashley!" \par
When Ashley awakened, she opened \cf1 h\cf0 er eyes, looked around, puzzled, and said, "Is everything all right?"\par
"Toni attacked me. S\cf1 h\cf0 e was angry because I found out she was trying to escape."\par
"I-I'm sorry. I had a feeling that something bad was happening."\par
"It's all right. I want to bring yo\cf1 u\cf0  and Toni and Alette together."\par

"Sooner or later, you're going to have to meet them, \cf1 Ashley.\cf0  You have to get to know one another. It's the only way you're going to be cured." \par
Ashley stood up. "I want to go back to my room."\par
\par
When she was returned to her room, Ashley watched the attendant leave. She was filled with a deep sense of despair. She thought\cf1 .\cf0  \i I'm never going to get out of here. They're lying to me. They can't cure me.\i0  She could not face the reality that other personalities were living inside of her...\cf1 .\cf0  Because of them, people had been murdered, families destroyed. \i Why me, God?\i0  She began to weep. \i What did I ever do to you?\i0  She sat down on the bed and thought, \i I\i0  \i can't go on like this. There's only one way to end it. I have to do it now.\par
\i0 She got up and wa\cf1 l\cf0 ked around the small room, looking for something sharp. There was nothing. The rooms had been carefully designed so that there was nothing in them that would allow the patients to harm themselves.\par
As her eyes darted around the room, she saw the paints and canvas and paintbrushes and walked over to them. The handles of the paintbrushes were wooden. Ashley snapped one in half, exposing sharp, jagged edges. Slowly, she took the sharp edge and placed it on her wrist. In one fast, deep movement, she cut into her veins and her blood began to pour out. Ashley placed the jagged edge on her other wrist and repeated the movement. She stood there, watching the blood stain the\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj And then the room went dark.\par
\par
When Dr. Gilbert \cf1 Keller\cf0  heard the news, he was shocked. He went to visit Ashley in the infirmary. Her wrists were heavily \cf1 bandaged.\cf0  Watching her lying there, Dr. Keller thought, \i I\i0  \i can't ever let this happen again.\par
\i0 "We almost lost you," he said. "It would have made me look bad."\par
Ashley managed a wry smile. "I'm sorry. But \cf1 every\cf0 thing seems so-so hopeless."\par
"That's where you're wrong," Dr. Keller assured her. "Do you want to be helped, Ashley?"\par
"Yes."\par
"Then you have to believe in me. You have to work with me. I can't do it alone. What do you say?"\par
The\cf1 re\cf0  was a long silence. "What do you want me to do?"\par
"First, I want a promise from you that you'll never try to harm yourself again."\par
"All right. I promise."\par
"I'm going to get the same promise now from \cf1 Toni \cf0 and \cf1 Alette.\cf0  I'm going to put you to sleep now." \par
A few minutes later\cf1 .\cf0  Dr. Keller was speaking to Toni. \par

Nothing. \par

There was such an incredible chasm between her innocent vulnerability and the dark forces that were able to take over her \cf1 life.\cf0  Every time he talked to Ashley, he had an overpowering urge to try to protect her. \i She's like a daughter to me,\i0  he thought. \i Who am I kidding?

Dr. Keller led Ashley into a small meeting room. There were six people in the room. \par
"I want you to meet some friends," Dr. Keller said. \par
He took Ashley around the room introducing them, but Ashley was too self-conscious to listen to their names. One name blurred into the next. There was Fat Woman, Bony Man, Bald Woman, Lame Man, Chinese Woman and Gentle Man. They all seemed very pleasan\cf1 t.\par
\cf0 "Sit down," Bald Woman said. "Would you like some coffee?" \par
Ashley took a seat. "Thank you."\par
"We've heard about you," Gent\cf1 l\cf0 e Man said. "You've been through a lot." \par
Ashley \cf1 nodded.\par
\cf0 Bony Man said, "I guess we've all been through a lot, but we're being helped. This place is wonderful."\par
"They have the best doctors in the world," Chinese Woman said.\par
\i They all seem so normal,\i0  Ashley though\cf1 t. \par
\cf0 Dr. Keller sat to one side, monitoring the conversations. Forty-five minutes later he rose. "I think it's time to go, Ashley."\par
Ashley stood up. "It was nice meeting all of you." \par
Lame Man walked up to her and whispered, "Don't drink the water here. It's poisoned. They want to kill us and still collect the money from the state." \par
Ashley \cf1 gulped.\cf0  "Thanks. I'll- I'll remember."\par

"No."\par
Dr. Keller walked into Otto \cf1 Lewison's\cf0  office. \par

The thought of being with Gilbert Keller on a date was exhilarating.\par
\par
They were having dinner at a Japanese restaurant called \cf1 Otani\cf0  Gardens, five miles from the hospital. Dr. Keller knew that he was taking a risk. At any moment, Toni or \cf1 Alette\cf0  could take over. He had been warned. \i It's more important that Ashley learns to trust me so that I can help her.\par
\i0 "It's funny, Gilbert," Ashley said, looking around the crowded restaurant. \par
"What is?"\par
"These people don't look any different from the people at the hospital."\par
"They aren't really different, Ashley. I'm sure they all have problems. The only difference is the people at the hospital aren't able to cope with them as well, so we help them."\par
"I didn't know I had any problems until- Well, you know."\par
"Do you know why, Ashley? Because you buried them. You couldn't face what happened to you, so you built the fences in your mind and shut the bad things away. To one degree or another, a lot of people do that." He deliberately changed the subject. "How's your steak?"\par
"Delicious, thank you."\par

"Thanks."\par
Dr. \cf1 Keller\cf0  arranged for \cf1 Toni\cf0  to have private access to the recreation room for one \cf1 h\cf0 our every afternoon. In t\cf1 h\cf0 e beginning, the doors were closed, but as other inmates heard the piano music and the singing from inside, they opened the door to listen. Soon, Toni was entertaining dozens of patients.\par
\par
Dr. Keller was looking over his notes with Dr. \cf1 Lewison.\par
\cf0 Dr. Lewison said, "What abo\cf1 u\cf0 t the other one-\cf1 Alette?"\par
\cf0 "I've set it up for her to paint in the garden every afternoon. She'll be watched, of course. I think it's going to be good therapy."\par
\par
But \cf1 Alette\cf0  refused. In a session wit\cf1 h\cf0  her, Dr. Keller said, "You don't use the paints I gave you, Alette. It's a shame to let them go to waste. You're so talented." \par
\i How would you know? \par
\i0 "Don't you enjoy painting?"\par
"Yes."\par
"Then why don't you do it?"\par
"Because I'm no good." \i Stop pestering me. \par
\i0 "Who told you that?"\par
"My-my mot\cf1 h\cf0 er."\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i0\f0 There was a long pause. "Yes. She died in an accident."\par
\par
The following day, Alette started to pain\cf1 t.\cf0  She enjoyed being in the \cf1 garden\cf0  with her canvas and brushes. W\cf1 h\cf0 en she painted, she was able to forget everyt\cf1 h\cf0 ing else. Some of the patients would gather around bar and watch. They talked in multicolored voices. \par
"Your paintings should be in a gallery." Black. \par

"That's right, dear. And they'\cf1 r\cf0 e all gone."\par
Dr. Keller said pointedly, "She's the third MPD patient leaving us this year."\par
And Ashley felt a surge of hope.\par

\par
"I've read your latest report," Dr. \cf1 Lewison\cf0  told Gilbert Keller. "Do you think there's a genuine lacuna, or are they playing games?"\par
"They're playing games, Otto. It's as though they know what I'm trying to do, and they won't let me. I think Ashley genuinely wants to help, but they won't allow her to. Usually under hypnosis you can get through to them, but Toni is very strong. She takes complete control, and she's dangerous."\par
"Dangerous?"\par
"Yes. Imagine how much hatred she must have in her to murder and castrate five men."\par
\par
The rest of the year went no better.\par
Dr. Keller was having success with his other patients, but Ashley, the one he was most conce\cf1 rn\cf0 ed about, was making no progress. Dr. Keller had a feeling that Toni enjoyed playing games with him. She was determined that he was not going to succeed. And then, unexpectedly, there was a breakt\cf1 h\cf0 rough.\par

\cf0 They were ushered into Dr. Lewison\cf1 's\cf0  office. He \cf1 rose \cf0 as they entered. "Dr. Patterson, I'm delighted to \cf1 meet \cf0 you."\par
"Thank you. This is Miss Victoria \cf1 Aniston\cf0  and her daughter, Katrina."\par
"How do you do, Miss Aniston? Katrina."\par
"I brought them along to meet \cf1 Ashley."\par
\cf0 "Wonderful. She's with Dr. \cf1 Keller\cf0  right now, but they s\cf1 h\cf0 ould be finished soon."\par

"Thank you, Miss Aniston." \par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj Dr. Patterson was studying him, puzzled. "Why?"\par
"It's not that unusual. At some stage, patients with \cf1 MPD\cf0  are afraid of meeting their alters. It terrifies them. The very thought that other characters can be living in their mind and body and take over at will- Well, you can imagine how devastating that can be." \par
Dr. Patterson \cf1 nodded.\cf0  "Of course."\par
"There's something that puzzles us about \cf1 Ashley's \cf0 problem. Almost always, these problems start with a history of molestation when the patient is very young. We have no record of anything like that in Ashley's case, so we have no idea how or why this trauma began."\par
Dr. Patterson sat there silently for a moment. When he spoke, he said heavily, "I can help you." He took a deep breath. "I blame myself." \par
Otto Lewison was watching intently. \par
"It happened when Ashley was six. I had to go to England. My wife couldn't go. I took Ashley with me. My wife had an elderly cousin over there named John. I didn't realize it at the time, but John had\cf1 ...\cf0  emotional problems. I had to leave to give a lecture one day, and John offered to baby-sit. When I got back that evening, he was gone. Ashley was in a state of complete hysteria. It took a long, long time to calm her down. After that, s\cf1 h\cf0 e wouldn't let anyone come near her, she became timid and wit\cf1 h\cf0 drawn and a week later, John was arrested as a serial child \cf1 molester."\cf0  Dr. \cf1 Patterson's\cf0  face was filled with pain. "I never f\cf1 o\cf0 rgave myself. I never left Ashley alone with anyone after that."\par

"It's been too painful for me even to discuss before."\par
"I understand." Otto Lewison looked at his watch. \cf1 "Ashley's\cf0  going to be a little while. Why don't you join Miss \cf1 Aniston\cf0  in the garden, and I'll send \cf1 Ashley\cf0  out when she comes." \par
Dr. Patterson rose. "Thank you. I will." \par

Victoria Aniston and \cf1 Katrina\cf0  we\cf1 r\cf0 e waiting for him. "Did you see Ashley?" Victoria asked.\par
"They'll send her out i\cf1 n\cf0  a few minutes," Dr. Patterson said. He looked around the spacious grounds. "This is lovely, isn't it?"\par
Katrina ran up to him, "I want to go up to the sky again."\par
He smiled. "All righ\cf1 t.\cf0 " He picked her up, threw her into the air and caught her as she came down. \par
"Higher!"\par
"Hang on. Here we go." He threw her up again and caug\cf1 h\cf0 t her, and she was screaming with delight. \par
"Again!"\par
Dr. \cf1 Patterson's\cf0  back was to the main building, so he did not see Ashley and Dr. Keller come out. \par

"I'm going to make you happy, honey." It was her father saying, \i0 "I'm going to make you happy, honey."\par

At six o'clock in the morning, Ashley went to the railroad station to wait for Jim. There was no sign of him.\par
She was beginning to panic. What could have happened? Ashley heard the train whistle in the distance. She looked at her watch: 7:00. The train was pulling into the station.

"I- The next thing I remember is being awakened by someone screaming in the alley. Then the sheriff came in to tell me that deputy Blake had been found dead." She stopped, her face pale.\par
"All right. I'm going to put you to sleep now. Just relax...\cf1 .\cf0  Close your eyes and relax...\cf1 ."\cf0  It took ten minutes. Dr. Keller said, "Toni.\cf1 .."\par
\cf0 "I'm here. You want to know what really happened, don't you? Ashley was a fool to invite Sam to stay at the apartment. I could have told her what he would do."\par
\i\par
He heard a cry from the bedroom, quickly rose from the couch and scooped up his gun. He hurried over to the bedroom door and listened a moment. Silence. He had imagined it. As he started to turn away, he heard it again. He pushed the door open, gun in hand. Ashley was in bed, naked, asleep. There was no one else in the room. She was making little moaning sounds. He moved to her bedside. She looked beaut\cf1 i\cf0 ful tying there, curled up in a fetal position. She moaned again, trapped in some terrible dream. He meant on\cf1 l\cf0 y to comfort her, to take her in his arms and hold her. He lay down at her side and gent\cf1 l\cf0 y pu\cf1 l\cf0 led her toward him, and he felt the heat of her body and began to be aroused. She was awakened by his voice saying, "It's all right\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\cf0\f0 now. You're safe." And his lips were on hers, and he was moving her legs apart and was inside her. \par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj And she was screaming,\i0  "No, Father\cf1 !\cf0 " \par
\i And he moved faster and faster in a primal urgency, and then the savage revenge took over. She grabbed the knife from the dresser drawer at her bedside and began to slash into his body.\par
\i0\par
"What happened after you killed him?"\par
"She wrapped his body in the sheets and dragged him to the elevator and then through the garage to the alley in back."\par
\cf1\par
"...\cf0  and then," Dr. \cf1 Keller\cf0  told \cf1 Ashley,\cf0  \cf1 "Toni\cf0  wrapped his body in the sheets and dragged him into the elevator and through the garage to the alley in back."\par
Ashley sat there, her face dead white. "She's a \cf1 mon\cf0 - \i I'm\i0  a monster."\par
Gilbert Keller said, "No. Ashley, you must remember that Toni was bo\cf1 rn\cf0  out of your pain, to protect you. The same is true of \cf1 Alette.\cf0  It's time to bring this to a closure. I want you to meet them. It's the next step to your getting well."\par
Ashley\cf1 's\cf0  eyes were tightly shut. "All right. When do we.\cf1 ..\cf0  do this?"\par
"Tomorrow morning."\par
\par
Ashley was in a deep hypnotic state. Dr. Keller started with Toni.\par
"Toni, I want you and Alette to talk to Ashley."\par
"What makes you think she can handle us?"\par
\pard\brdrt\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 \brdrb\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 \nowidctlpar\qr\i\f1 Tell Me Your Dreams * 345\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i0\f0 "I think she can."\par
"All right, \cf1 Dockie.\cf0  Whatever you say."\par
"Alette, are you ready to meet Ashley?"\par
"If Toni says it's all right."\par
"Sure, Alette. It's about time." \par
Dr. Keller took a deep breath and said, "Ashley, I want you to say hello to Toni."\par
There was a long silence. Then, a timid, "Hello, Toni\cf1 ..."\par
"\cf0 Hello."\par
"Ashley, say hello to Alette."\par
"Hello, Alette\cf1 ..."\par
"\cf0 Hello, Ashley.\cf1 .."\par
\cf0 Dr. Keller breathed a deep sigh of relief. "I want you all to get to know one another. You've suffered through the same terrible traumas. They've separated you from one another. But there's no reason for that separation anymore. You're going to become one whole, healthy person. It's a long journey, but you've begun it. I promise you, the most difficult part is over."\par
\par
From that point on, Ashley\cf1 '\cf0 s treatment moved swiftly. Ashley and her two alters talked to one another every day.\par
"I had to protect you," Toni explained. "I suppose every time I killed one of those men, I was killing Father for what he had done to you."\par
"I tried to protect you, too," Alette said. "I-I appreciate that. I'm grateful to both of you." \par
Ashley tu\cf1 rn\cf0 ed to Dr. Keller and said wryly, "It's really all me, isn't it? I'm talking to myself."\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0\i0\f0 "You're talking to two other parts of yourself," he corrected her gently. "It's time for all of you to unify and become one again." \par
\cf1 Ashley\cf0  looked at him and smiled. "I'm ready."\par
\par
That afternoon\cf1 .\cf0  Dr. \cf1 Keller\cf0  went to see Otto \cf1 Lewison. \par
\cf0 Dr. Lewison said, "I hear good reports, Gilbert." \par
Dr. Keller \cf1 nodded.\cf0  \cf1 "Ashley's\cf0  made remarkable progress. In another few months, I think she can be released and go on with her treatment as an outpatient."\par
"That's wonderful news. Congratulations." \par
\i I'll miss her\cf1 .\cf0\i0  Dr. Keller thought. \i I'll miss her terribly.\par
\i0\par
"Dr. \cf1 Salem\cf0  is on line two for you, Mr. Singer."\par
"Right." David \cf1 r\cf0 eached for the phone, puzzled. Why would Dr. Salem be calling? It had been years since the two men had talked. \cf1 "Royce?"\par
\cf0 "Good morning, David. I have some interesting information for you. It's about Ashley \cf1 Patterson."\par
\cf0 David felt a sudden sense of alarm. "What about her?"\par
"Do you remember how hard we tried to find the trauma that had caused her condition, and we failed?"\par
David remembered it well. It had been a major weakness in their case. "Yes."\par
"Well, I just learned the answer. My friend, Dr. Lewison, who's head of the Connecticut Psychiatric Hospital, just called. The missing piece of the puzzle is Dr. \cf1 Steven\cf0  Patterson. He's the one who molested Ashley w\cf1 h\cf0 en she was a child." \par
David asked incredulously, \i "What?"\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\i0\f0 "Dr. Lewison just learned about it." \par
David sat listening as Dr. Salem went on, but his mind was elsewhere. He was recalling Dr. Patterson\cf1 's\cf0  words. \i "You're the only one I trust, David. My daughter means everything in the world to me. You're going to save her life...\cf1 .\cf0  I want you to defend Ashley, and I won't have anyone else involved in this case...."\par
\i0 And David suddenly realized why Dr. Patterson had been so insistent on his representing Ashley alone. The doctor was sure that if David had ever discovered what he had done, he would have protected him. Dr. Patterson had had to decide between his daughter and his reputation, and he had chosen his reputation. \i The son of a bitch!\cf1  \par
\cf0\i0 "Thanks, Royce."\par
\par
That afte\cf1 rn\cf0 oon, as Ashley passed the recreation room\cf1 , \cf0 she saw a copy of the \cf1\i Westport\cf0  News\i0  that someone had left there. On the front page of the newspaper was a photograph of her father with Victoria \cf1 Aniston\cf0  and \cf1 Katrina.\cf0  The beginning of the story read, "Dr. Steven Patterson is to be married to socialite Victoria Aniston, who has a three-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. Dr. Patterson is joining the staff of St. John's Hospital in Manhattan, and he and his future wife have bought a house on Long Island...."\par
Ashley stopped and her face contorted into a mask of rage. "I'll kill the son of a bitch," \cf1 Toni\cf0  screamed. "I'll kill him!"\par
She was completely out of control. They had to put her in a padded room where she could not hurt herself,\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\cf0\i0\f0 restrained by handcu\cf1 ff\cf0 s and leg-irons. When the attendants came to feed her, she tried to grab them, and they had to be \cf1 careful\cf0  not to get too close to her. \cf1 Toni\cf0  had taken total possession of \cf1 Ashley.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj\cf0 When she saw Dr. \cf1 Keller,\cf0  she screamed, "Let me out of here, you bastard. Now!"\par
"We're going to let you out of here," Dr. Keller said \cf1 soothingly,\cf0  "but first you have to calm down."\par
"I'm calm," Toni \cf1 yelled.\cf0  "Let me go!" Dr. Keller sat on the floor beside her and said, "Toni, when you saw that picture of your father, you said you were going to hurt him, and-\cf1 "\par
"\cf0 You're a liar! I said I was going to \i kill\i0  him!"\par
"There's been enough killing. You don't wa\cf1 n\cf0 t to stab anyone else."\par
"I'm not going to stab him. Have you heard of hydrochloric acid? It will eat through anything, including skin. Wait until I-\cf1 "\par

"\cf0 Toni, forget about this."\par
"All right. I can think of some other ways that are even better."\par
He studied her a moment, frustrated. "Why are you so angry?"\par
"Don't you know? I thought you were supposed to be such a great doctor. He's marrying a woman with a \cf1 teen-year-old\cf0  daughter. What's going to happen to that little girl, Mr. Famo\cf1 u\cf0 s Doctor? I'll tell you what. The\par

It was raining, a steady downpour of raindrops \cf1 f\cf0 litting the roof of the speeding car. She looked at her mother sitting at the wheel, squinting at the road ahead, and she smiled, in a happy mood. She began to sing:\par
\par
"All around the mulberry bush, \par
The monkey chased-\cf1 "\par
\cf0\par
Her mother turned to her and screamed, "Shut up. I told you I detest that song. You make me sick, you miserable little-\cf1 "\par
\cf0 After that, everything seemed to happen in slow motion. The curve ahead, the car \cf1 skidding\cf0  off the road, the tree. The crash flung her out of the car. She was shaken, bu\cf1 t\cf0  unhurt. She got to her feet. She could hear her mother, trapped in the car, screaming, "Get me out of here. Help me! Help me!"\par
And she stood there watching until the car finally exploded.\par
\i0\par
"Hate? Do you want to hear more?"\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj She was parked at the curb, with the motor running. She watched Walter Manning cross the street, headed for the garage where he kept his car. She put the car in gear and slammed her foot down on the accelerator. At the last moment, he heard the sound of the car coming toward him, and he turned. She watched the expression on his face as the car smashed into him and then \cf1 hurled \cf0 his broken body aside. She kept driving. There were no witnesses. God was on her side.\par
\par
"That's\i0  hate, \cf1 Dockie!\cf0  That's real hate!" \par
Gilbert \cf1 Keller\cf0  listened to her recital, appalled, shaken by the cold-blooded viciousness of it. He can\cf1 c\cf0 eled the rest of his appointments for the day. He needed to be alone.\par
\par
The following morning when Dr. Keller walked into the padded cell, \cf1 Alette\cf0  had taken over.\par
"Why are you doing this to me\cf1 .\cf0  Dr. Keller?" Alette asked. "Let me out of here."\par
"I will\cf1 ,"\cf0  Dr. Keller assured her. "Tell me about \cf1 Toni. \cf0 What has she told you?"\par
"She said we have to escape from here and kill Father."\par
Toni took over. "Morning, Dockie. We're fine now. Why don't you let us go?"\par
Dr. Keller looked into her eyes. There was cold-blooded murder there. \par

"Right now, I can't even reach \cf1 Ashley."\par
"\cf0 I suppose this means having to start the treatment all over."\par
Dr. Keller was thoughtful. "Not really, Otto. We've arrived at the point where the three alters have gotten to know one another. That was a big breakthrough. The next step was to get them to integrate. I have to find a way to do tha\cf1 t.\cf0 "\par
"That damned article-\cf1 "\par

F\cf0 ive days later Ashley had taken over.\par
When Dr. \cf1 Keller\cf0  walked into the padded cell, Ashley said, "Good morning, Gilbert. I'm sorry that all this happened."\par
"I'm glad it did, Ashley. We're going to get all of our feelings oat in the open." He \cf1 nodded\cf0  to the guard to \cf1 remove\cf0  the leg-irons and handcuf\cf1 f\cf0 s.\par
Ashley stood up and rubbed her wrists. "That wasn't very comfortable," she said. They walked out into the corridor. \cf1 "Toni's\cf0  very angry."\par
"Yes, but she's going to get over it. Here's my plan.\cf1 ..."\par
\par
\cf0 There were three or four articles about Dr. \cf1 Steven\cf0  \cf1 Pat-terson\cf0  every month. One read: "Dr. Steven \cf1 Patterson\cf0  is to wed Victoria \cf1 Aniston\cf0  in an elaborate wedding ceremony on Long Island this Friday. Dr. \cf1 Patterson's\cf0  colleagues will fly in to attend\cf1 ..."\par
Toni\cf0  was hysterical when Dr. Keller showed the story to her.\par
"That marriage isn't going to last long."\par
"Why do you say that, Toni?"\par
"Because he's going to be \cf1 dead."\par
\cf0 "Dr. S\cf1 te\cf0 ven Patter\cf1 s\cf0 on has resigned from St. Jo\cf1 h\cf0 n's Hospital and will head the ca\cf1 r\cf0 diac staff at Manhattan Me\cf1 t\cf0 hodist Hospital.\cf1 ..."\par

"Dr. Steven Patterson received \cf1 the Lasker\cf0  Award for his work in medicine and is being honored at the White House.\cf1 ..."\par
"\cf0 They should hang the bastard\cf1 !\cf0 " Toni \cf1 yelled.\par
\cf0\par
Gilbert Keller saw to it that Toni received all the articles written about her father. And as time went by, with each new item, Toni's rage seemed to be diminishing. It was as t\cf1 h\cf0 oug\cf1 h\cf0  her emotions had been worn out. She went from \cf1 h\cf0 atred to anger and, finally, to a resigned acceptance.\par
\par
There was a mention in the real estate section. "Dr. Steven Patterson and his new bride have moved into a home in Manhattan, but t\cf1 h\cf0 ey plan to purchase a second home in the \cf1 Hamptons\cf0  and will be spending their summers there with their daughter, \cf1 Katrina." \par
\cf0 Toni started \cf1 sobbing.\cf0  "How could he do that to \cf1 u\cf0 s?"\par
"Do you feel that that little \cf1 girl\cf0  has taken your place, Toni?"\par
"I don't know. I'm-I'm confused."\par
\par
Another year went by. Ashley had therapy sessions t\cf1 h\cf0 ree times a week. \cf1 Alette\cf0  painted almost eve\cf1 r\cf0 y day, but Toni refused to s\cf1 i\cf0 ng or p\cf1 l\cf0 ay the piano.\par
At \cf1 Christmas,\cf0  Dr. Ke\cf1 l\cf0 ler showed Toni a new clipping. There wa\cf1 s\cf0  a picture of her f\cf1 a\cf0 t\cf1 h\cf0 er and Victoria and \cf1 Katrina.\par

It was the fi\cf1 r\cf0 st sign of a new breakthrough.\par
\par
One day, as Dr. Keller passed the recreation room, he heard Toni singing and playing the piano. Surprised, he stepped int\cf1 o\cf0  the room and watched her. She was completely absorbed in the music. \par
The next day, Dr. Keller had a session with Toni. \par
"Your father's getting older, Toni. How do you \cf1 t\cf0 hink you'll feel when he dies?"\par
"I-I don't want him to die. I know I said a lot of stupid t\cf1 h\cf0 ings, but I said them because I was angry wit\cf1 h \cf0 him."\par

Dr. Keller smiled. \i We're back on tr\cf1 a\cf0 ck.\par

"My pleasure, \cf1 luv."\par

Ashley took a deep breath. "Good-bye, Toni. Goodbye, Alette."\par
"Good-bye, Ashley." \par
"Take care of yourself, Ashley." \par
Ten minutes later, Ashley was in a deep hypnotic state. "Ashley, there's nothing more to be afraid of. All your problems are behind you. You don't need anyone to protect you anymore. You're able to handle your life without help, without shutting out any bad experiences.\par

It was a sunny June day, and as she walked down Madiso\cf1 n\cf0  Avenue in New York City, her radia\cf1 n\cf0 t smile made people turn back to look at her. She had never been so happy. She thought of the wonderful life ahead of her, and all that she was going to do. There could have been a terrible ending for her, she thought, but this was the happy ending she had prayed for.\par
She walked into Pennsylvania Station. It was the busiest train station in America, a \cf1 charmless\cf0  maze of airless rooms and passages.

\i0 She purchased a ticket from one of the machines. Her train was just pulling in. \cf1\i Serendipity,\cf0\i0  she thought.\par
She \cf1 boarded\cf0  the train and took a seat. She was filled with excitement at what was about to happen. The train gave a jerk and then started picking up speed. \i I'm on my way at last.\i0  And as the train headed toward the \cf1 Hamptons,\cf0  she began to sing softly:\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi284\qj Multiple personality disorder \cf1 (MPD),\cf0  also known as \cf1 dissociative\cf0  identity disorder (DID), is a controv\cf1 e\cf0 rsial topic among psychia\cf1 t\cf0 rists. Some psychiatrists believe t\cf1 h\cf0 at it does not exist. On the other hand, for years many doctors, hospitals and social services organizations have been treating patients who suffer from MPD. Some studies estimate that between 5 and 15 percent of psychiatric patients are afflicted with i\cf1 t.\par
