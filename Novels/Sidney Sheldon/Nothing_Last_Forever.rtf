District Attorney Carl Andrews was in a fury. "What the hell is going on here?'' he demanded. "We have three doctors living together and working at the same hospital. One of them almost gets an entire hospital closed down, the second one kills a patient f
or a million dollars, and the third one is murdered."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Andrews stopped to take a deep breath. "And they're all women! Three goddam women doctors! The media is treating them like celebrities. They're all over the tube. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 60 Minutes }{

ind of heroines! I wouldn't be surprised if the government put their faces on postage stamps, like Pres\-ley. Well, by God, I won't have it!" He slammed a fist down against the photograph of a woman on the cover of }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Time }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 magazine. The caption read: "Dr. Paige Taylor\emdash  Angel of Mercy or the Devil's Disciple?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Paige Taylor." The district attorney's voice was filled with disgust. He turned to Gus Venable, his chief prosecuting attorney. "I'm handing this trial over to you, Gus. I want a conviction. Murder One. The gas chamber."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't worry," Gus Venable said quietly. "I'll see to it."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Sitting in the courtroom watching Dr. Paige Taylor, Gus Venable thought: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She's jury-proof. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Then he smiled to himself. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 No one is jury-proof. }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was tall and slen\-der, with eyes that were a startling dark brown in her pale face. A disinterested observer would have dis\-missed her as an attractive woman. A more observant one would have noticed something else\emdash 
that all the different phases of her life coexisted in her. There was the happy excitement of the child, superimposed onto the shy uncertainty of the adolescent and the wisdom and pain of the woman. There was a look of innocence about her. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She's the kind of girl, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable thought cynically, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a man would be proud to take home to his mother. If his mother had a taste for cold-blooded kill\-ers.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
There was an almost eerie sense of remoteness in her eyes, a look that said that Dr. Paige Taylor had retreated deep inside herself to a different place, a different time, far from the cold, sterile courtroom where she was trapped.
\par 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The trial was taking 
place in the venerable old San Francisco Hall of Justice on Bryant Street. The building, which housed the Superior Court and County Jail, was a forbidding-looking edifice, seven stories high, made of square gray stone. Visitors arriving at the courthouse 
were funneled through electronic security checkpoints. Upstairs, on the third floor, was the Superior Court. In Courtroom 121, where murder trials were held, the judge's bench stood against the rear wall, with an Amer\-
ican flag behind it. To the left of the bench was the jury box, and in the center were two tables separated by an aisle, one for the prosecuting attorney, the other for the defense attorney.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The courtroom was packed with reporters and the type of spectators attracted to fatal highway accidents
 and murder trials. As murder trials went, this one was spectacular. Gus Venable, the prosecuting attorney, was a show in himself. He was a burly man, larger than life, with a mane of gray hair, a goatee, and the courtly manner of a Southern plantation ow
ner. He had never been to the South. He had an air of vague bewilderment and the brain of a computer. His trademark, summer and winter, was a white suit, with an old-fashioned stiff-collar shirt.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige Taylor's attorney, Alan Penn, was Venable's opposite, a compact, energetic shark, who had built a reputation for racking up acquittals for his clients.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The two men had faced each other before, and their relationship was one of grudging respect and total mis\-trust. To Venable's surprise, Alan Penn had come to see him the week before the trial was to begin.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I came here to do you a favor, Gus."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Beware of defense attorneys bearing gifts.  "}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 What did you have in mind, Alan?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Now understand\emdash I haven't discussed this with my client yet, but suppose\emdash just suppose\emdash I could per\-suade her to plead guilty to a reduced charge and save the State the cost of a trial?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you asking me to plea-bargain?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable reached down to his desk, searching for something. "I can't find my damn calendar. Do you know what the date is?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "June first. Why?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "For a minute there, I thought it must be Christmas already, or you wouldn't be asking for a present like that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Gus . . ."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Venable leaned forward in his chair. "You know, Alan, ordinarily, I'd be inclined to go along with you. Tell you the truth, I'd like to be in Alaska fishing right now. But the answer is no. You're defending a cold\-
blooded killer who murdered a helpless patient for his money. I'm demanding the death penalty."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I think she's innocent, and I\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Venable gave a short, explosive laugh. "No, you don't. And neither does anyone else. It's an open-and-shut case. Your client is as guilty as Cain."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Not until the jury says so, Gus."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "They will." He paused. "They will."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 After Alan Penn left, Gus Venable sat there thinking about their conversation. Penn's coming to him was a sign of weakness. Penn knew there was no chance he could win the trial. Gus Venable thought about the irre\-
futable evidence he had, and the witnesses he was going to call, and he was satisfied.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was no question about it. Dr. Paige Taylor was going to the gas chamber.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It had not been easy to impanel a jury. The case had occupied the headlines for months. The cold-blooded\-ness of the murder had created a tidal wave of anger.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
The presiding judge was Vanessa Young, a tough, brilliant black jurist rumored to be the next nominee for the United States Supreme Court. She was not known for being patient with lawyers, and she had a quick temper. There was an
 adage among San Francisco trial lawyers: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 If your client is guilty, and you're looking for mercy, stay away from Judge Young's courtroom.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The day before the start of the trial, Judge Young had summoned the two attorneys to her chambers.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're going to set some ground rules, gentlemen. Because of the serious nature of this trial, I'm willing to make certain allowances to make sure that the defen\-
dant gets a fair trial. But I'm warning both of you not to try to take advantage of that. Is that clear?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, your honor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, your honor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable was finishing his opening statement. "And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the State will prove\emdash yes, prove beyond a reasonable doubt\emdash 
that Dr. Paige Taylor killed her patient, John Cronin. And not only did she commit murder, she did it for money . . . a lot of money. She killed John Cronin for one million dollars.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Believe me, after you've heard all the evidence, you will have no trouble in finding Dr. Paige Taylor guilty of murder in the first degree. Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The jury sat in silence, unmoved but expectant.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable turned to the judge. "If it please your honor, I would like to call Gary Williams as the State's first witness."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When the witness was sworn in, Gus Venable said, "You're an orderly at Embarcadero County Hospital?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, that's right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Were you working in Ward Three when John Cronin was brought in last year?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Can you tell us who the doctor in charge of his case was?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How would you characterize the relationship be\-tween Dr. Taylor and John Cronin?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Objection!" Alan Penn was on his feet. "He's call\-ing for a conclusion from the witness."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sustained."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let me phrase it another way. Did you ever hear any conversations between Dr. Taylor and John Cronin?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, sure. I couldn't help it. I worked that ward all the time."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Would you describe those conversations as friendly?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, sir."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Really? Why do you say that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, I remember the first day Mr. Cronin was brought in, and Dr. Taylor started to examine him, he said to keep her . . ."He hesitated. "I don't know if I can repeat his language."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Go ahead, Mr. Williams. I don't think there are any children in this courtroom."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, he told her to keep her fucking hands off him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, he always called her 'that bitch.' He didn't want her to go near him. Whenever she came into his room, he would say things like 'Here comes that bitch again!' and 'Tell that bi

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable paused to look over to where Dr. Taylor was seated. The jurors' eyes followed him. Venable shook his head, as though saddened, then turned back to the witness. "Did Mr. Cronin 
seem to you to be a man who wanted to give a million dollars to Dr. Taylor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Seated in the back of the courtroom, Jason Curtis was filled with anger. He could not believe what the witnesses were saying about Paige. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This is the woman I love, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
he thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The woman I'm going to marry.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Immediately after Paige's arrest, Jason Curtis had gone to visit her in jail.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll fight this," he assured her. "I'll get you the best criminal lawyer in the country." A name immedi\-ately sprang to mind. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason had gone to see him.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I've been following the case in the papers," Penn said. "The press has already tried and convicted her of murdering John Cronin for a bundle. What's more, she admits she killed him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know her," Jason Curtis told him. "Believe me, there's no way Paige could have done what she did for money."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Since she admits she killed him," Penn said, "what we're dealing with here then is euthanasia. Mercy killings are against the law in California, as in most st
ates, but there are a lot of mixed feelings about them. I can make a pretty good case for Florence Nightingale listening to a Higher Voice and all that shit, but the problem is that your lady love killed a patient who left her a million dollars in his wil
l. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Did she know about the million before she killed him, or after?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paige didn't know a thing about the money," Jason said firmly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Penn's tone was noncommittal. "Right. It was just a happy coincidence. The DA is calling for Murder One, and he wants the death penalty."
\par "Will you take the case?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Penn hesitated. It was obvious that Jason Curtis be\-lieved in Dr. Taylor. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The way Samson believed in Deli\-lah. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at Jason and thought: }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 wonder if the poor son of a bitch had a haircut and doesn't know it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason was waiting for an answer.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll take the case, as long as you know it's all uphill. It's going to be a tough one to win."
\par Alan Penn's statement turned out to be overly opti\-mistic.
\par

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 An attorney, Roderick Pelham, was on the stand. Gus Venable said, "When you told Dr. Taylor about the million dollars from John Cronin's estate, what did she say?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She said something like 'It seems unethical. He was my patient.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The trial was now in its fourth week. The spectators and press had found the prosecuting attorney and de\-
fense attorney fascinating to watch. Gus Venable was dressed in white and Alan Penn in black, and the two of them had moved around the courtroom like players in a deadly, choreographed game of chess, with Paige Taylor the sacrificial pawn.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable was tying up the loose ends.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, yes. She came into our travel agency two or three years ago."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She said she was interested in a trip to London and Paris and, I believe, Venice."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, no. She said she wanted everything first class\emdash  plane, hotel. And I believe she was interested in charter\-ing a yacht."
\par 
\par The courtroom was hushed. Gus Venable walked over to the prosecutor's table and held up some folders. "The police found these brochures in Dr. Taylor's apartment. These are travel itineraries to Paris and Lon\-don and Venice, brochures for exp
ensive hotels and airlines, and one listing the cost of chartering a private yacht."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a loud murmur from the courtroom.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The prosecutor had opened one of the brochures.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Here are some of the yachts listed for charter," he read aloud. "The }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Christina O . . . }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 twenty-six thousand dollars a week plus ship's expenses ... the }{

twenty-seven thousand three hundred dollars a week." He looked up. "There's a check mark after the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lucky Dream. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Paige Taylor had already selected the twenty-seven-thousand-three-hun-dred-a-week yacht. She just hadn't selected her victim yet.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'd like to have these marked Exhibit A." Venable turned to Alan Penn and smiled. Alan Penn looked at Paige. She was staring down at the table, her face pale. "Your witness."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fifty people a day?" He sounded impressed. "And the day we're talking about was two or three years ago. If you multiply fifty by nine hundred days, that's roughly forty-five thousand people."                         }{

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And did he come into the operating room while the operation was going on?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Toward the end. Yes. But it was too late to do anything. We were unable to revive the patient."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And did Dr. Barker say anything to Dr. Taylor at that time?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, we were all pretty upset, and ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I asked you if Dr. Barker said anything to Dr. Tay\-lor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And what did Dr. Barker say?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a pause, and in the middle of the pause, there was a crack of thunder outside, like the voice of God. A moment later, the storm broke, nailing raindrops to the roof of the courthouse.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Barker said, 'You killed him.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The spectators were in an uproar. Judge Young slammed her gavel down. "That's enough! Do you peo\-ple live in caves? One more outburst like that and you'll all be standing outside in the rain."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable waited for the noise to die down. In the hushed silence he said, "Are you sure that's what Dr. Barker said to Dr. Taylor? 'You killed him'?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And you have testified that Dr. Barker was a man whose medical opinion was valued?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you. That's all, doctor." He turned to Alan Penn. '' Your witness.''
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Penn rose and approached the witness box.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Peterson, I've never watched an operation, but I imagine there's enormous tension, especially when it's something as serious as a heart operation."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's a great deal of tension."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "At a time like that, how many people are in the room? Three or four?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, no. Always half a dozen or more."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Really?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. There are usually two surgeons, one assisting, sometimes two anesthesiologists, a scrub nurse, and at least one circulating nurse."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I see. Then there must be a lot of noise and excite\-ment going on. People calling out instructions and so on."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And I understand that it's a common practice for music to be playing during an operation."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It is."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "When Dr. Barker came in and saw that Lance Kelly was dying, that probably added to the confusion."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, everybody was pretty busy trying to save the patient."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Making a lot of noise?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There was plenty of noise, yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And yet, in all that confusion and noise, and over the music, you could hear Dr. Barker say that Dr. Taylor had killed the patient. With all that excitement, you could have been wrong, couldn't you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, sir. I could not be wrong."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What makes you so sure?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Peterson sighed. "Because I was standing right next to Dr. Barker when he said it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was no graceful way out.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No more questions."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The case was falling apart, and there was nothing he could do about it. It was about to get worse.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Denise Berry took the witness stand.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're a nurse at Embarcadero County Hospital?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How long have you worked there?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Five years."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "During that time, did you ever hear any conversa\-tions between Dr. Taylor and Dr. Barker?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sure. Lots of times."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Can you repeat some of them?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Nurse Berry looked at Dr. Taylor and hesitated. "Well, Dr. Barker could be very sharp ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I didn't ask you that, Nurse Berry. I asked you to tell us some specific things you heard him say to Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a long pause. "Well, one time he said she was incompetent, and ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable put on a show of surprise. "You heard Dr. Barker say that Dr. Taylor was incompetent?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, sir. But he was always ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What other comments did you hear him make about Dr. Taylor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The witness was reluctant to speak. "I really can't remember."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Miss Berry, you're under oath."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, once I heard him say ..." The rest of the sentence was a mumble.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We can't hear you. Speak up, please. You heard him say what?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He said he ... he wouldn't let Dr. Taylor operate on his dog."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a collective gasp frorn the courtroom.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But I'm sure he only meant ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I think we can all assume that Dr. Barker meant what he said."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 All eyes were fixed on Paige Taylor.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The prosecutor's case against Paige seemed over\-whelming. Yet Alan Penn had the reputation of being a master magician in the courtroom. Now it was his turn to present the defendant's case. Could he pull an\-other
 rabbit out of his hat?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige Taylor was on the witness stand, being ques\-tioned by Alan Penn. This was the moment everyone had been waiting for.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "John Cronin was a patient of yours, Dr. Taylor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, he was."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And what were your feelings toward him?" "I liked him. He knew how ill he was, but he was very courageous. He had surgery for a cardiac tumor." "You performed the heart surgery?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And what did you find during the operation?" "When we opened up his chest, we found that he had melanoma that had metastasized."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "In other words, cancer that had spread throughout}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 his body."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes.  It had metastasized throughout the lymph glands."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Meaning that there was no hope for him? No heroic measures that could bring him back to health?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "None."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "John Cronin was put on life-support systems?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's correct."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor, did you deliberately administer a fatal dose of insulin to end John Cronin's life?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I did."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a sudden buzz in the courtroom.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She's really a cool one, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She makes it sound as though she gave him a cup of tea.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Would you tell the jury why you ended John Cronin's life?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Because he asked me to. He begged m
e to. He sent for me in the middle of the night, in terrible pain. The medications we were giving him were no longer working." Her voice was steady. "He said he didn't warn to suffer anymore. His death was only a few days away He pleaded with me to end it
 for him. I did."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Doctor, did you have any reluctance to let him die? Any feelings of guilt?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Paige Taylor shook her head. "No. If you could have seen . . . There was simply no point to letting him go on suffering.'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How did you administer the insulin?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I injected it into his IV."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And did that cause him any additional pain?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. He simply drifted off to sleep."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable was on his feet. "Objection! I think the defendant means he drifted off to his death! I\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young slammed down her gavel. "Mr. Ven\-able, you're out of order. You'll have your chance to cross-examine the witness. Sit down."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The prosecutor looked over at the jury, shook his head, and took his seat.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor, when you administered the insulin to John Cronin, were you aware that he had put you in his will for one million dollars?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. I was stunned when I learned about it."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her nose should be growing, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You never discussed money or gifts at any time, or asked John Cronin for anything?''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A faint flush came to her cheeks. "Never!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But you were on friendly terms with him?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. When a patient is that ill, the doctor-patient relationship changes. We discussed his business prob\-lems and his family problems."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But you had no reason to expect anything from him?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He left that money to you because he had grown to respect you and trust you. Thank you, Dr. Taylor." Penn turned to Gus Venable. "Your witness."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Penn r
eturned to the defense table, Paige Taylor glanced toward the back of the courtroom. Jason was seated there, trying to look encouraging. Next to him was Honey. A stranger was sitting next to Honey in the seat that Kat should have occupied. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 If}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189   }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she were still alive. But Kat is dead, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
killed her, too.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable rose and slowly shuffled over to the witness box. He glanced at the rows of press. Every seat was filled, and the reporters were all busily scrib\-bling. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to give you somethi
ng to write about, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Venable thought.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He stood in front of the defendant for a long moment, studying her. Then he said casually, "Dr. Taylor . . . was John Cronin the first patient you murdered at Embarcadero County Hospital?''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn was on his feet, furious. "Your honor, I\emdash !"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young had already slammed her gavel down. "Objection sustained!" She turned to the two attorneys. "There will be a fifteen-minute recess. I want to see counsel in my chambers."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When the two attorneys were in her chambers, Judge Young turned to Gus Venable. "You }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 did }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 go to law school, didn't you, Gus?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry, your honor. I\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did you see a tent out there?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I beg your pardon?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her voice was a whiplash. "My courtroom is not a circus, and I don't intend to let you turn it into one. How dare you ask an inflammatory question like that!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I apologize, your honor. I'll rephrase the question and\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You'll do more than that!" Judge Young snapped. "You'll rephrase your attitude. I'm warning you, you pull one more stunt like that and I'll declare a mistrial."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, your honor."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they returned to the courtroom, Judge Young said to the jury, "The jury will completely disregard the prosecutor's last question." She turned to the prose\-cutor. "You may go on."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable walked back to the witness box. "Dr. Taylor, you must have been very surprised when you were informed that the man you murdered left you one million dollars."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn was on his feet. "Objection!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sustained." Judge Young turned to Venable. "You're trying my patience."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I apologize, your honor." He turned back to the wit\-ness. "You must have been on }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 very }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 friendly terms with your patien
t. I mean, it isn't every day that an almost complete stranger leaves us a million dollars, is it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige Taylor flushed slightly. "Our friendship was in the context of a doctor-patient relationship."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wasn't it a little more than that? A man doesn't cut h
is beloved wife and family out of his will and leave a million dollars to a stranger without some kind of persuasion. Those talks you claimed to have had with him about his business problems ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young leaned forward and said warningly, "Mr. Venable ..." The prosecutor raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. He turned back to the defen\-
dant. "So you and John Cronin had a friendly chat. He told you personal things about himself, and he liked you and respected you. Would you say that's a fair summation, doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And for doing that he gave you a million dollars?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked out at the courtroom. She said nothing. She had no answer.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Venable started to walk back toward the prosecutor's table, then suddenly turned to face the defendant again.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor, you testified earlier that you had no idea that John Cronin was going to leave you any money, or that he was going to cut his family out of his will."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's correct."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How much does a resident doctor make at Embar-cadero County Hospital?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn was on his feet. "Objection! I don't see..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
"It's a proper question. The witness may answer." "Thirty-eight thousand dollars a year." Venable said sympathetically, "That's not very much these days, is it? And out of that, there are deductions and taxes and living expenses. That wouldn't leave enoug
h to take a luxury vacation trip, say, to London or Paris or Venice, would it?" "I suppose not."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. So you didn't plan to take a vacation like that, because you knew you couldn't afford it." "That's correct."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn was on his feet again. "Your honor ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young turned to the prosecutor. "Where is this leading, Mr. Venable?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I just want to establish that the defendant could not plan a luxury trip without getting the money from someone."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She's already answered the question."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn knew he had to do something. His heart wasn't in it, but he approached the witness box with all the good cheer of a man who had just won the lottery.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor, do you remember picking up these travel brochures?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Were you planning to go to Europe or to charter a yacht?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Of course not. It was all sort of a joke, an impossible dream. My friends and I thought it would lift our spirits. We were very tired, and ... it seemed like a good idea at the time." Her voice trailed off.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn glanced covertly at the jury. Their faces registered pure disbelief.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable was questioning the defendant on reex-amination. "Dr. Taylor, are you acquainted with Dr. Lawrence Barker?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She had a sudden memory flash. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to kill Lawrence Barker. I'll do it slowly. I'll let him suffer first. . . then I'll kill him. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. I know Dr. Barker."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "In what connection?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Barker and I have often worked together during the past two years."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Would you say that he's a competent doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn jumped up from his chair. "I object, your honor. The witness ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 But before he could finish or Judge Young could rule, Paige answered, "He's more than competent. He's brilliant."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Penn sank back in his chair, too stunned to speak.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Would you care to elaborate on that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Barker is one of the most renowned cardiovas\-cular surgeons in the world. He has a large private practice, but he donates three days a week to Embarcadero County Hospital."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "So you have a high regard for his judgment in medi\-cal matters?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And do you feel he would be capable of judging another doctor's competence?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Penn willed Paige to say }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 don't know.
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She hesitated. "Yes."
\par Gus Venable turned to the jury, "You've heard the defendant testify that she had a high regard for Dr. Barker's medical judgment. I hope she listened carefully to Dr. Barker's judgment about her competence ... or the lack of it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn was on his feet, furious. "Objection!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sustained."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 But it was too late. The damage had been done.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 During the next recess, Alan Penn pulled Jason into the men's room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What the hell have you gotten me into?" Penn de\-manded angrily. "John Cronin hated her, Barker hated h
er. I insist on my clients telling me the truth, and the whole truth. That's the only way I can help them. Well, I can't help }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 her. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Your lady friend has given me a snow job so deep I need skis. Every time she opens her mouth she puts a nail in her coffin. The fucking case is in free fall!"
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That afternoon, Jason Curtis went to see Paige.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You have a visitor, Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason walked into Paige's cell.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paige ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She turned to him, and she was fighting back tears. "It looks pretty bad, doesn't it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason forced a smile. "You know what the man said\emdash 'It's not over till it's over.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Jason, you don't believe that I killed John Cronin for his money, do you? What I did, I did only to help him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I believe you," Jason said quietly. "I love you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He took her into his arms. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 don't want to lose her, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
I can't. She's the best thing in my life. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Everything is going to be all right. I promised you we would be together forever.''
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige held him close and thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Nothing lasts for\-ever. Nothing. How could everything have gone so wrong . . . so wrong . . . so wrong . . .}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Hunter, Kate." "Here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Taft, Betty Lou." "I'm here." "Taylor, Paige." "Here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They were the only women among the large group of incoming first-year residents gathered in the large, drab auditorium at Embarcadero County Hospital.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Embarcadero County was the oldest hospital in San Francisco, and one of the oldest in the country. During the earthquake of 1989, God had played a joke on the residents of San Francisco and left the hospital standing.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was an ugly complex, occupying more than three square blocks, with buildings of brick and stone, gray with years of accumulated grime.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Inside the front entrance of the main building was a large waiting room, with hard wooden benches for pa\-tients and visitors. The walls were flaking from t
oo many decades of coats of paint, and the corridors were worn and uneven from too many thousands of patients in wheelchairs and on crutches and walkers. The entire complex was coated with the stale patina of time.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Embarcadero County Hospital was a city w
ithin a city. There were over nine thousand people employed at the hospital, including four hundred staff physicians, one hundred and fifty part-time voluntary physicians, eight hundred residents, and three thousand nurses, plus the technicians, unit aide
s, and other technical person\-nel. The upper floors contained a complex of twelve operating rooms, central supply, a bone bank, central scheduling, three emergency wards, an AIDS ward, and over two thousand beds.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Now, on the first day of the arrival of the new resi\-dents in July, Dr. Benjamin Wallace, the hospital ad\-
ministrator, rose to address them. Wallace was the quintessential politician, a tall, impressive-looking man with small skills and enough charm to have ingratiated his way up to his present position.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I want to welcome all of you new resident doctors this morning. For the first two years of medical school, you worked with cadavers. In the last two years, you have worked with hospital patients under the supervi\-
sion of senior doctors. Now, it's }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 you }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 who are going to be responsible for your patients. It's an awesome responsibility, and it takes dedication and skill."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 His eyes scanned the auditorium. "Some of you are planning to go into surgery. Others of you will be going into internal medicine. E
ach group will be assigned to a senior resident who will explain the daily routine to you. From now on, everything you do could be a matter of life or death."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They were listening intently, hanging on every word.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Embarcadero is a county hospital. That means we admit anyone who comes to our door. Most of the pa\-
tients are indigent. They come here because they can't afford a private hospital. Our emergency rooms are busy twenty-four hours a day. You're going to be overworked and underpaid. In a private hosp
ital, your first year would consist of routine scut work. In the second year, you would be allowed to hand a scalpel to the surgeon, and in your third year, you would be permitted to do some supervised minor surgery. Well, you can forget all that. Our mot
to here is 'Watch one, do one, teach one.'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're badly understaffed, and the quicker we can get you into the operating rooms, the better. Are there any questions?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There were a million questions the new residents wanted to ask.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "None? Good. Your first day officially begins tomor\-row. You will report to the main reception desk at five-thirty tomorrow morning. Good luck!"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The briefing was over. There was a general exodus toward the doors and the low buzz of excited conversations. The three women found themselves standing to\-gether.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Where are all the other women?" "I think we're it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a lot like medical school, huh? The boys' club. I have a feeling this place belongs to the Dark Ages." The person talking was a flawlessly beautiful black woman, nearly 
six feet tall, large-boned, but intensely graceful. Everything about her, her walk, her carriage, the cool, quizzical look she carried in her eyes, sent out a message of aloofness. "I'm Kate Hunter. They call me Kat."
\par "Paige Taylor." Young and friendly, intelligent-looking, self-assured.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They turned to the third woman.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Betty Lou Taft. They call me Honey." She spoke with a soft Southern accent. She had an open, guileless face, soft gray eyes, and a warm smile.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Where are you from?" Kat asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Memphis, Tennessee."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They looked at Paige. She decided to give them the simple answer. "Boston."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Minneapolis," Kat said. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That's close enough, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said, "It looks like we're all a long way from home. Where are you staying?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm at a fleabag hotel," Kat said. "I haven't had a chance to look for a place to live."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey said, "Neither have I."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige brightened. "I looked at some apartments this morning. One of them was terrific, but I can't afford it. It has three bedrooms ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They stared at one another. "If the three of us shared..." Kat said.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The apartment was in the Marina district, on Filbert Street. It was perfect for them. 3Br/2Ba, nu cpts, lndry, prkg, utils pd. It was furnished in early Sears Roebuck, but it was neat and clean.
\par When the three women were through inspecting it, Honey said, "I think it's lovely."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "So do I!" Kat agreed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They looked at Paige.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let's take it."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They moved into the apartment that afternoon. The janitor helped them carry their luggage upstairs.
\par "So you're gonna work at the hospital," he said. "Nurses, huh?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Doctors," Kat corrected him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at her skeptically. "Doctors? You mean, like }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 real }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 doctors?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, like real doctors," Paige told him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He grunted. "Tell you the truth, if I needed medical attention, I don't think I'd want a woman examining my body."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll keep that in mind."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Where's the television set?" Kat asked. "I don't see one."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "If you want one, you'll have to buy it. Enjoy the apartment, ladies\emdash er, doctors." He chuckled.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They watched him leave.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat said, imitating his voice, "Nurses, eh?" She snorted. "Male chauvinist. Well, let's pick out our bed\-rooms."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Any one of them is fine with me," Honey said softly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They examined the three bedrooms. The master bed\-room was larger than the other two.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat said, "Why don't you take it, Paige? You found this place."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige nodded. "All right."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They went to their respective rooms and began to unpack. From her suitcase, Paige carefully removed a framed photograph of a man in his early t
hirties. He was attractive, wearing black-framed glasses that gave him a scholarly look. Paige put the photograph at her bedside, next to a bundle of letters.
\par Kat and Honey wandered in. "How about going out and getting some dinner?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm ready," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat saw the photograph. "Who's that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige smiled. "That's the man I'm going to marry. He's a doctor who works for the World Health Organiza\-tion. His name is Alfred Turner. He's working in Africa right now, but he's coming to San Francisco so we can be together."
}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Lucky you," Honey said wistfully. "He looks nice."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at her. "Are you involved with any\-one?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. I'm afraid I don't have much luck with men."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat said, "Maybe your luck will change at Embarcadero."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The three of them had dinner at Tarantino's, not far from their apartment building. During dinner they chat\-
ted about their backgrounds and lives, but there was a restraint to their conversation, a holding back. They were three strangers, probing, cautiously getting to know one another.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey spoke very little. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There's a shyness about her, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She's vulnerable. Some man in Memphis probably broke her heart.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at Kat. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Self-confident. Great dignity. I like the way she speaks. You can tell she came from a good family.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Meanwhile, Kat was studying Paige. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A rich girl who never had to work for anything in her life. She's gotten by on her looks.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was looking at the two of them. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They're so confident, so sure of themselves. They're going to have an easy time of it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They were all mistaken.
\par 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
When they returned to their apartment, Paige was too excited to sleep. She lay in bed, thinking about the future. Outside her window, in the street, there was the sound of a car crash, and then people shouting, and in Paige's min
d it dissolved into the memory of African natives yelling and chanting, and guns being fired. She was transported back in time, to the small jungle village in East Africa, caught in the middle of a deadly tribal war.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was terrified. "They're going to kill us!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her father took her in his arms. "They won't harm us, darling. We're here to help them. They know we're their friends."
\par And without warning, the chief of one of the tribes had burst into their hut. . . .}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
\par Honey lay in bed thinking, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This is sure a long way from Memphis, Tennessee, Betty Lou. I guess I can never go back there. Never again. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She could hear the sheriffs voice saying to her, "Out of respect for his family, we're going to list the death of the Reverend Douglas Lipton as a 'suicide for re

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At five-thirty the following morning, when the new residents checked in, members of the hospital staff were standing by to guide them to their various assignments. Even at that early hour, the bedlam had begun.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The patients had been coming in all night, arriving in ambulances, and police cars, and on foot. The staff called them the "F and J's"\emdash 
the flotsam and jetsam that streamed into the emergency rooms, broken and bleeding, victims of shootings and stabbings and auto\-mobile accidents, the wounded in flesh and spirit, the homeless and the unwanted, the ebb and flow of human\-
ity that streamed through the dark sewers of every large city.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a pervasive feeling of organized chaos, frenetic movements and shrill sounds and dozens of unexpected crises that all had to be attended to at once.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The new residents stood in a protective huddle, get\-ting attuned to their new environment, listening to the arcane sounds around them.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige, Kat, and Honey were waiting in the corridor when a senior resident approached them. "Which one of you is Dr. Taft?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey looked up and said, "I am."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The resident smiled and held out his hand. "It's an honor to meet you. I've been asked to look out for you. Our chief of staff says that you have the highest medical school grades this hospital has ever seen. We're de\-
lighted to have you here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at the others and took a deep breath. "Here I go! I wish us all luck!"
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The head nurse, Margaret Spencer, was more a battle\-ship than a woman, heavyset and stern-looking, with a brusque manner. She was busy behind the nurses' sta\-tion when Paige approached.
\par "Excuse me ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Nurse Spencer looked up. "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I was told to report here. I'm Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Nurse Spencer consulted a sheet. "Just a moment." She walked through a door and returned a minute later with some scrubs and white coats.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Here you are. The scrubs are to wear in the op\-erating theater and on rounds. When you're doing rounds, you put a white coat over the scrubs."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh. And here." She reached down and handed Paige a metal tag that read "Paige Taylor, M.D." "Here's your name tag, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige held it in her hand and looked at it for a long time. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige Taylor, M.D. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She felt as though she had been handed the Medal of Honor. All the long hard years of work and study were summed up in those brief words. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige Taylor, M.D.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Nurse Spencer was watching her. "Are you all right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm fine." Paige smiled. "I'm just fine, thank you. Where do I . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Doctors' dressing room is down the corridor to the left. You'll be making rounds, so you'll want to change."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige walked 
down the corridor, amazed at the amount of activity around her. The corridor was crowded with doctors, nurses, technicians, and patients, hurrying to various destinations. The insistent chatter of the public address system added to the din.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Keenan ... OR Three. ... Dr. Keenan . . . OR Three."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige approached a door marked }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 doctors' dressing room }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
and opened it. Inside there were a dozen doctors in various stages of undress. Two of them were totally naked. They turned to stare at Paige as the door opened.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh! I... I'm sorry," Paige mumbled, and quickly closed the door. She stood there, uncertain about what to do. A few feet down the corridor, she saw a door marked }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 nurses' dressing room. }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige walked over to it and opened the door. Inside, several nurses were changing into their uniforms.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of them looked up. "Hello. Are you one of the new nurses?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No," Paige said tightly. "I'm not." She closed the door and walked back to the doctors' dressing room. She stood there a moment, then took a deep breath and entered. The conversation came to a stop.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of the men said, "Sorry, honey. This room is for doctors."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm a doctor," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They turned to look at one another. "Oh? Well, er . . . welcome."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you." She hesitated a moment, then walked over to an empty locker. The men watched as she put her hospital clothes into the locker. She looked at the men for a moment, then slowly started to unbutton her blouse.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The doctors stood there, not sure what to do. One of them said, "Maybe we should\emdash er\emdash give the little lady some privacy, gentlemen."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The little lady }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you," Paige said. She stood there, waiting, as the doctors finished dressing and left the room. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Am I going to have to go through this every dayl }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she wondered.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In hospital rounds, there is a traditional formation that never varies. The attending physician is always in the lead, followed by the senior resident, then the other residents, and one or two medical students. The at\-
tending physician Paige had been assigned to was Dr. William Radnor. Paige and five other residents were gathered in the hallway, waiting to meet him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the group was a young Chinese doctor. He held out his hand. "Tom Chang," he said. "I hope you're all as nervous as I am."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige liked him immediately.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A man was approaching the group. "Good morn\-ing," he said. "I'm Dr. Radnor." He was soft-spoken, with sparkling blue eyes. Each resident introduced him\-self.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This is your first day of rounds. I want you to pay close attention to everything you see and hear, but at the same time, it's important to appear relaxed."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige made a mental note. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Pay close attention, but appear to be relaxed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "If the patients see that you're tense, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 they're }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 going to be tense, and they'll probably think they're dying of some disease you aren't telling them about."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Don't make patients tense.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Remember, from now on, you're going to be re\-sponsible for the lives of other human beings."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Now responsible for other lives. Oh, my God! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The longer Dr. Radnor talked, the more nervous Paige became, and by the time he was finished, her self-confidence had completely vanished. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm not ready for this. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
don't know what I'm doing. Who ever said I could be a doctor! What if I kill somebody!}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Radnor was going on, "I will expect detailed notes on each one of your patients\emdash lab work, blood, electrolytes, everything. Is that clear?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There were murmurs of "Yes, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There are always thirty to forty surgical patients here at one time. It's your job to make sure that every\-
thing is properly organized for them. We'll start the morning rounds now. In the afternoon, we'll make the same rounds again."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It had all seemed so easy at medical school. Paige thought about the four years she had spent there. There had been one hundred 
and fifty students, and only fifteen women. She would never forget the first day of Gross Anatomy class. The students had walked into a large white tiled room with twenty tables lined up in rows, each table covered with a yellow sheet. Five students were 
assigned to each table.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
The professor had said, "All right, pull back the sheets." And there, in front of Paige, was her first cadaver. She had been afraid that she would faint or be sick, but she felt strangely calm. The cadaver had been preserved, which 
somehow removed it one step from humanity.
\par 
\par In the beginning the students had been hushed and respectful in the anatomy laboratory. But, incredibly to Paige, within a week, they were eating sandwiches dur\-ing the dissections, and making rude jokes. It was 
a form of self-defense, a denial of their own mortality. They gave the corpses names, and treated them like old friends. Paige tried to force herself to act as casually as the other students, but she found it difficult. She looked at the cadaver she was w
orking on, and thought: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Here was a man with a home and a family. He went to an office every day, and once a year he took a vacation with his wife and children. He probably loved sports and enjoyed movies and plays, and he laughed and cried, and he watched h
is children grow up and he shared their joys and their sorrows, and he had big, wonderful dreams. I hope they all came true. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 ... A bittersweet sadness engulfed her because he was dead and }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 was alive.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In time, even to Paige, the dissections became routine. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Open the chest, examine the ribs, lungs, pericar-dial sac covering the heart, the veins, arteries, and nerves.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Much of the first two years of medical school was spent memorizing long lists that the students referred to as the Organ Recital. First the cranial nerves: olfactory, optic, oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, abducens, fa\-
cial, auditory, glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal, and hypoglossal.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The students used mnemonics to help them remem\-ber. The classic one was "On old Olympus's towering tops, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 French }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 and }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 German vended some tops." The modern male version was "Oh, oh, oh, to touch and feel a girl's vagina\emdash such heaven."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The last two years of medical school were more inter\-esting, with courses in internal medicine, surgery, pedi\-atrics, and obstetrics, and they worked at the local hospital. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 remember the time . . . }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was thinking.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor ..." The senior resident was staring at her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige came to with a start. The others were already halfway down the corridor.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Coming," she said hastily.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The first stop was at a large, rectangular ward, with rows of beds on both sides of the room, with a small stand next to each bed. Paige had expected to see cur\-tains separating the beds, but here there was no privacy.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The first patient was an elderly man
 with a sallow complexion. He was sound asleep, breathing heavily. Dr. Radnor walked over to the foot of the bed, studied the chart there, then went to the patient's side and gently touched his shoulder. "Mr. Potter?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The patient opened his eyes. "Huh?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good morning. I'm Dr. Radnor. I'm just checking to see how you're doing. Did you have a comfortable night?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It was okay."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you have any pain?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yeah. My chest hurts."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let me take a look at it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When he finished the examination, he said, "You're doing fine. I'll have the nurse give you something for the pain."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll be back to see you this afternoon."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They moved away from the bed. Dr. Radnor turned to the residents. "Always try to ask questions that have a yes or no answer so t
he patient doesn't tire himself out. And reassure him about his progress. I want you to study his chart and make notes. We'll come back here this afternoon to see how he's doing. Keep a run\-
ning record of every patient's chief complaint, present illness, past illnesses, family history, and social history. Does he drink, smoke, etc.? When we make the rounds again, I'll expect a report on the progress of each pa\-tient."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They moved on to the bed of the next patient, a man in his forties.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good morning, Mr. Rawlings."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good morning, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you feeling better this morning?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Not so good. I was up a lot last night. My stomach's hurting."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Radnor turned to the senior resident. "What did the proctoscopy show?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No sign of any problem."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Give him a barium enema and an upper GI, stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The senior resident made a note.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The resident standing next to Paige whispered in her ear, "I guess you know what stat stands for. 'Shake that ass, tootsie!' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Radnor heard. " 'Stat' comes from the Latin, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 statim. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Immediately."
\par In the years ahead, Paige was to hear it often.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next patient was an elderly woman who had had a bypass operation.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good morning, Mrs. Turkel."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How long are you going to keep me in here?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Not very long. The procedure was a success. You'll be going home soon."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And they moved on to the next patient.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The routine was repeated over and over, and the morning went by swiftly. They saw thirty patients. After each patient, the residents frantically scribbled notes, praying that they would be able to decipher them later.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One patient was a puzzle to Paige. She seemed to be in perfect health.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they had moved away from her, Paige asked, "What's her problem, doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Radnor sighed. "She has no problem. She's a gomer. And for those of you who forgot what you were taught in medical school, gomer is an acronym for 'Get out of my emergency room!' Gomers are people who }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 enjoy }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 poor health. That's their hobby. I've admitted her six times in the last year."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They moved on to the last patient, an old woman on a respirator, who was in a coma.
\par "She's had a massive heart attack," Dr. Radnor ex\-plained to the residents. "She's been in a coma for six weeks. Her vital signs are failing. There's nothing more we can do for her. We'll pull the plug this afternoon."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at him in shock. "Pull the plug?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Radnor said gently, "The hospital ethics commit\-tee made the decision this morning. She's a vegetable. She's eighty-seven 
years old, and she's brain-dead. It's cruel to keep her alive, and it's breaking her family financially. I'll see you all at rounds this afternoon."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They watched him walk away. Paige turned to look at the patient again. She was alive. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In a few hours she will be dead. We'll pull the plug this afternoon.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That's murder! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That afternoon, when the rounds were finished, the new residents gathered in the small upstairs lounge. The room held eight tables, an ancient black-and-white television set, and two vending ma\-
chines that dispensed stale sandwiches and bitter cof\-fee.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The conversations at each table were almost identical.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat sat down at a table with Paige and Honey. "How did it go?" she asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey said, "I think it went all right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They both looked at Paige. "I was tense, but I was relaxed. I was nervous, but I stayed calm." She sighed. "It's been a long day. I'll be glad to get out of here and have some fun tonight."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Me, too," Kat agreed. "Why don't we have dinner and then go see a movie?''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm coming." She took a deep breath and got to her feet. "I'll see you later."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige followed the orderly into an elevator and rode up to the fifth floor, where Dr. Wallace's office was located.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Benjamin Wallace was seated behind his desk. He glanced up as Paige walked in. "Good afternoon, Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good afternoon."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace cleared his throat. "Well! Your first day and you've already made quite an impression!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're ..." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 We're not girls, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige started to say. "We would appreciate that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Meanwhile, if you don't want to dress with the nurses ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm not a nurse," Paige said firmly. "I'm a doc\-tor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Of course, of course. Well, we'll do something about accommodations for you, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you."
\par 
\par He handed Paige a sheet of paper. "Meanwhile, this is your schedule. You'll be on call for the next twenty-four hours, starting at six o'clock." He looked at his watch. "That's thirty minutes from now."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was looking at him in astonishment. Her day had started at five-thirty that morning. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Twenty-four hours?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, thirty-six, actually. Because you'll be starting rounds again in the morning."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Thirty-six hours! I wonder if I can handle this.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was soon to find out.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige went to look for Kat and Honey.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm going to have to forget about dinner and a movie," Paige said. "I'm on a thirty-six-hour call."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat nodded. "We just got our bad news. I go on it tomorrow, and Honey goes on Wednesday."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It won't be so bad," Paige said cheerfully. "I understand there's an on-call room to sleep in. I'm going to enjoy this."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was wrong.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 An orderly was leading Paige down a long corridor. "Dr. Wallace told me that I'll be on call for thirty-six hours," Paige said. "Do all the residents work those hours?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Only for the first three years," the orderly assured her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Great!}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But you'll have plenty of chance to rest, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I will?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "In here. This is the on-call room." He opened the door, and Paige stepped inside. The room resembled a monk's cell in some pove
rty-stricken monastery. It contained nothing but a cot with a lumpy mattress, a cracked wash basin, and a bedside stand with a tele\-phone on it. "You can sleep here between calls."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The calls began as Paige was in the coffee shop, just starting to have her dinner. "Dr. Taylor . . . ER Three. ... Dr. Taylor . . . ER Three."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We have a patient with a fractured rib. . . ." "Mr. Henegan is complaining of chest pains. ..." "The patient in Ward Two has a headache. Is it all right to give him an acetami
nophen . . .?" At midnight, Paige had just managed to fall asleep}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 when she was awakened by the telephone. "Report to ER One." It was a knife wound, and by the time Paige had taken care of it, it was one-thirty in the morning. At two-fifteen she was awakene
d again. "Dr. Taylor . . . Emergency Room Two. Stat." Paige said, groggily, "Right." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 What did he say it meant? Shake that ass, tootsie. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She forced herself up and moved down the corridor to the emergency room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A patient had been brought in with a broken leg. He was screaming with pain.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Get an X-ray," Paige ordered. "And give him Demerol, fifty milligrams." She put her hand on the pa\-tient's arm. "You're going to be fine. Try to relax."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Over the PA system, a metallic disembodied voice said, "Dr. Taylor . . . Ward Three. Stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at the moaning patient, reluctant to leave him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The voice came on again, "Dr. Taylor . . . Ward Three. Stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Coming," Paige mumbled. She hurried out the door and down the corridor to Ward Three. A patient had vomited, aspirated, and was choking.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He can't breathe," the nurse said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Suction him," Paige ordered. As she watched the patient begin to catch his breath, she heard her name again on the PA system. "Dr. Taylor . . . Wa
rd Four. Ward Four." Paige shook her head and ran down to Ward Four, to a screaming patient with abdominal spasms. Paige gave him a quick examination. "It could be intestinal dysfunction. Get an ultrasound," Paige said.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 By the time she returned to the pat
ient with the broken leg, the pain reliever had taken effect. She had him moved to the operating room and set the leg. As she was finishing, she heard her name again. "Dr. Taylor, report to Emergency Room Two. Stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The stomach ulcer in Ward Four is having a pain. ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 must not panic, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I've got to remain calm and cool. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She panicked. Who was more important, the patient she was examining, or the next patient? "You stay here,'' she said inanely. "I'll be right back.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Paige hurried toward ER Two, she heard her name called again. "Dr. Taylor . . . ER One. Stat. ... Dr. Taylor . . . ER One. Stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Oh, my Godl }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. She felt as though she were caught up in the middle of some endless terrifying nightmare.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 During what was left of the night, Paige was awak\-
ened to attend to a case of food poisoning, a broken arm, a hiatal hernia, and a fractured rib. By the time she stumbled back into the on-call room, she was so exhausted that she could hardly
 move. She crawled onto the little cot and had just started to doze off when the telephone rang again.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She reached out for it with her eyes closed. "H'lo ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor, we're waiting for you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wha'?" She lay there, trying to remember where she was.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Your rounds are starting, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "My rounds?" }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This is some kind of bad joke, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It's inhuman. They can't work anyone like thisl }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
But they were waiting for her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ten minutes later, Paige was making the rounds again, half asleep. She stumbled against Dr. Radnor. "Excuse me," she mumbled, "but I haven't had any sleep ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He patted her on the shoulder sympathetically. "You'll get used to it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige finally got off duty, she slept for fourteen straight hours.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The intense pressure and punishing hours proved to be too much for some of the residents, and they simply disappeared from the hospital. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That's not going to hap\-pen to me, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige vowed.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The pressure was unrelenting. At the end of one of Paige's shifts, thirty-six grueling hours, she was so ex\-hausted that she had no idea where she was. She stum\-bled to the elevator and stood there, her mind numb.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Tom Chang came up to her. "Are you all right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fine," Paige mumbled.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He grinned. "You look like hell."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks. Why do they do this to us?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang shrugged. "The theory is that it keeps us in touch with our patients. If we go home and leave them, we don't know what's happening to them while we're gone."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige nodded. "That makes sense." It made no sense at all. "How can we take care of them if we're asleep on our feet?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang shrugged again. "I don't make the rules. It's the way all hospitals operate." He looked at Paige more closely. "Are you going to be able to make it home?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at him and said haughtily, "Of course."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Take care." Chang disappeared down the corridor. Paige waited for the elevator to arrive. When it finally came, she was standing there, sound asleep.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you want to hear a terrible confession?" Paige asked. "Sometimes when they wake me up at four o'clock in the morning to give somebody an aspirin, and I'm stumbling down the hall, half conscious, and I pas
s the rooms where all the patients are tucked in and having a good night's sleep, I feel like banging on all the doors and yelling, 'Everybody wake up!' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat held out her hand. "Join the club."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The patients came in all shapes, sizes, ages, and colors. They were frightened, brave, gentle, arrogant, demanding, considerate. They were human beings in pain.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Most of the doctors were dedicated people. As in any profession, there were good doctors and bad doctors. They were young and old, clumsy and adept, pleas
ant and nasty. A few of them, at one time or another, made sexual advances to Paige. Some were subtle and some were crude.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At breakfast one morning before rounds, Paige and Kat talked about the sexual harassment they were expe\-riencing.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Most of the doctors behave like perfect gentlemen, but a few of them seem to think we're perks that go with 
the territory, and that we're there to service them," Kat said. "I don't think a week goes by but what one of the doctors hits on me. 'Why don't you come over to my place for a drink? I've got some great CDs.' Or in the OR, when I'm assisting, the surgeon
 will brush his arm across my breast. One moron said to me, 'You know, whenever I order chicken, I like the dark meat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sighed. "They think they're flattering us by treating us as sex objects. I'd rather they treated us as doctors."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A lot of them don
't even want us around. They either want to fuck us or they want to fuck us. You know, it's not fair. Women are judged inferior until we prove ourselves, and men are judged superior until they prove what assholes they are."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's the old boys' network," Paige said. "If there were more of us, we could start a new girls' network."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige had heard of Arthur Kane. He was the subject of constant gossip around the hospital. His nickname was Dr. 007\emdash licensed to kill. His solution to every problem 
was to operate, and he had a higher rate of operations than any other doctor at the hospital. He also had a higher mortality rate.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was bald, short, hawk-nosed, with tobacco-stained teeth, and was grossly overweight. Incredibly, he fancied himself a ladies' man. He liked to refer to the new nurses and female residents as "fresh meat."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige Taylor was fresh meat. He saw her in the up\-stairs lounge and sat down at her table, uninvited.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked up, startled. "I beg your pardon?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm Dr. Kane. My friends call me Arthur." There was a leer in his voice.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige wondered how many friends he had.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How are you getting along here?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The question caught Paige off-guard. "I. . .all right, I think."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He leaned forward. "This is a big hospital. It's easy to get lost here. Do you know what I mean?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said warily, "Not exactly."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're too pretty to be just another face in the crowd. If you want to get somewhere here, you need someone to help you. Someone who knows the ropes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The conversation was getting more unpleasant by the minute.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And you'd like to help me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right." He bared his tobacco-stained teeth. "Why don't we discuss it at dinner?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's nothing to discuss," Paige said. "I'm not interested."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Arthur Kane watched Paige get up and walk away, and there was a baleful expression on his face.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 First-year surgical residents were on a two-month rotation schedule, alternating among obstetrics, ortho\-pedics, urology, and surgery.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige learned that it was dangerous to go into a train\-ing hospital in the summer for any serious illness, be\-cause many of the staff
 doctors were on vacation and the patients were at the mercy of the inexperienced young residents.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Nearly all surgeons liked to have music in the op\-erating room. One of the doctors was nicknamed Mozart and another Axl Rose because of their tastes in music.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 For some reason, operations always seemed to make everyone hungry. They constantly discussed food. A surgeon would be in the middle of removing a gangre\-
nous gall bladder from a patient and say, "I had a great dinner last night at Bardelli's. Best Italian food in all of San Francisco."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Have you eaten the crab cakes at the Cypress Club . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "If you like good beef, try the House of Prime Rib over on Van Ness."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And meanwhile, a nurse would be mopping up the patient's blood and guts.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they weren't talking about food, the doctors talked about baseball or football scores.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did you see the 49ers play last Sunday? I bet they miss Joe Montana. He always came through for them in the last two minutes of a game."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And out would come a ruptured appendix.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At three in the morning, when Paige was asleep in the on-call room, she was awakened by the telephone.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A raspy voice said, "Dr. Taylor\emdash Room 419\emdash a heart attack patient. You'll have to hurry!" The line went dead.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sat on the edge of the bed, fighting sleep, and stumbled to her feet. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 You have to hurry. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She went into the corridor, but there was no time to wait for an eleva\-
tor. She rushed up the stairs and ran down the fourth-floor corridor to Room 419, her heart pounding. She flung open the door and stood there, staring.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Room 419 was a storage room.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat Hunter was making her rounds with Dr. Richard Hutton. He was in his forties, brusque and fast. He spent no more than two or three minut
es with each patient, scanning their charts, then snapping out orders to the surgical residents in a machine-gun, staccato fashion.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Check her hemoglobin and schedule surgery for tomorrow. ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat and the other residents were busily making notes on everything, trying hard to keep up with him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They approached a patient who had been in the hospi\-tal a week and had had a battery of tests for a high fever, with no results.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they were out in the corridor, Kat asked, "What's the matter with him?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a GOK," a resident said. "A God only knows. We've done X-rays, CAT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, liver biopsy. Everything. We don't know what's wrong with him."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They moved into a ward where a young patient, his head bandaged after an operation, was sleeping. As Dr. Hutton started to unwrap the head dressing, the patient woke up, startled. "What . . . what's going on?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sit up," Dr. Hutton said curtly. The young man was trembling.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'll never treat my patients that way, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat vowed.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next patient was a healthy-looking man in his seventies. As soon as Dr. Hutton approached the bed, the patient yelled, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Gonzo! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
I'm going to sue you, you dirty son of a bitch."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That's an oxymoron, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A nurse filled a syringe and moved toward the little girl.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No!" she screamed. "You're going to hurt me!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This won't hurt, baby," the nurse assured her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The words were a dark echo in Kat's mind.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This won't hurt, baby. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 ... It was the voice of her stepfather whispering to her in the scary dark.
\par "This will feel good. Spread your legs. Come on, you little bitch!" And he had pushed her legs apart and forced his male hardness into her and put his hand over her mouth to keep her from screaming with the pain. She
 was thirteen years old. After that night, his visits became a terrifying nightly ritual. "You're lucky you got a man like me to teach you how to fuck," he would tell her. "Do you know what a Kat is? A little pussy. And I want some." And he would fall on 
top of her and grab her, and no amount of crying or pleading would make him stop.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat had never known her father. Her mother was a cleaning woman who worked nights at an office building near their tiny apartment in Gary, Indiana. Kat's stepfa\-ther was a hug
e man who had been injured in an accident at a steel mill, and he stayed home most of the time, drinking. At night, when Kat's mother left for work, he would go into Kat's room. "You say anything to your mother or brother, and I'll kill him," he told Kat.
 / }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 can't let him hurt Mike, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Kat thought. Her brother was five years younger than she, and Kat adored him. She mothered him and protected him and fought his battles for him. He was the only bright spot in Kat's life.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One morning, terrified as Kat was by her stepfather's threats, she decided she had to tell her mother what was happening. Her mother would put a stop to it, would protect her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mama, your husband comes to my bed at night when you're away, and forces himself on me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her mother stared at her a moment, then slapped Kat hard across the face.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't you dare make up lies like that, you little slut!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat never discussed it again. The only reason she stayed at home was because of Mike. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He'd be lost without me, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat
 thought. But the day she learned she was pregnant, she ran away to live with an aunt in Minneapolis.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The day Kat ran away from home, her life completely changed.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You don't have to tell me what happened," her Aunt Sophie had said. "But from now on, you're going to stop running away. You know that song they sing on }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Sesame Street! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
'It's Not Easy Being Green'? Well, honey, it's not easy being black, either. You have two choices. You can keep running and hiding and blaming the world for your problems, or you can stand up for yourself and decide to be somebody important."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was arranged quietly, during a weekend, and it was performed by a midwife who was a friend of Kat's aunt. When it was over, Kat thought fiercely, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm never going to let a man touch me aga

Minneapolis was a fairyland for Kat. Within a few blocks of almost every home were lakes and streams and rivers. And there were over eight thousand acres of landscaped parks. She went sailing on the city lakes and took boat rides on the Mississippi.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She visited the Great Zoo with Aunt Sophie and spent Sundays at the Valleyfair Amusement Park. She went on the hay rides at Cedar Creek Farm, and watched knights in armor jousting at the Shakopee Renaissance Festival.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Aunt Sophie watched Kat and thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The girl has never had a childhood.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was learning to enjoy herself, but Aunt Sophie sensed that deep inside her niece was a place that no one could reach, a barrier she had set up to keep her from being hurt again.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She made friends at school. But never with boys. Her girlfriends were all dating, but Kat was a loner, and too proud to tell anyone why. She looked up to her aunt, whom she loved very much.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat had taken little interest in school, or in reading books, but Aunt Sophie changed all that. Her home was filled with books, and Sophie's excitement about them was contagious.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There are wonderful worlds in there," she told the young girl. "Read, and you'll learn where you came from and where you're going. I've got a feeling that you're going to
 be famous one day, baby. But you have to get an education first. This is America. You can become anybody you want to be. You may be black and poor, but so were some of our congresswomen, and movie stars, and scientists, and sports legends. One day we're 
going to have a black president. You can be anything you want to be. It's up to you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat became the top student in her class. She was an avid reader. In the school library one day, she happened to pick up a copy of Sinclair Lewis's }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Arrowsmith, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
and she was fascinated by the story of the dedicated young doctor. She read Agnes Cooper's }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Promises to Keep, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 and }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Woman Surgeon }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
by Dr. Else Roe, and it opened up a whole new world for Kat. She discovered that there were people on this earth who 
devoted themselves to helping others, to saving lives. When Kat came home from school one day, she said to Aunt Sophie, "I'm going to be a doctor. A famous one."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was finally on his way back to her! Paige read the telegram again and again, her excitement growing each time. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alfred! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
His name conjured up a tumbling kaleidoscope of exciting memories . . .
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Alfred had grown up together. Their fathers were part of a medical cadre of WHO that traveled to Th
ird World countries, fighting exotic and virulent diseases. Paige and her mother accompanied Dr. Taylor, who headed the team.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Alfred had had a fantasy childhood. In India, Paige learned to speak Hindi. At the age of two, she knew that the name for the bamboo hut they lived in was }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 basha. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Her father was }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 gorasahib, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a white man, and she was }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 nani, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a little sister. They addressed Paige's father as }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
abadhan, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 the leader, or }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 baba, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 father.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige's parents were not around, she drank }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 bhanga, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 an intoxicating drink made with hashish leaves, and ate }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 chapati }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 with }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 ghi.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And then they were on their way to Africa. Off to another adventure!}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Alfred became used to swimming and bath\-ing in rivers that had crocodiles and hippopotamuses. Their pets were baby
 zebras and cheetahs and snakes. They grew up in windowless round huts made of wattle and daub, with packed dirt floors and conical thatched roofs. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Someday, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige vowed to herself, }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to live in a real house, a beautiful cottage with a green lawn and a white picket fence.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 To the doctors and nurses, it was a difficult, frustrat\-ing life. But to the two children, it was a constant adventure, living in the land of lions, giraffes, and ele\-
phants. They went to primitive cinder-block school-houses, and when none was available, they had tutors.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was a bright child, and her mind was a sponge, absorbing everything. Alfred adored her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm going to marry you one day, Paige," he said when she was twelve, he fourteen.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm going to marry you, too, Alfred."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They were two serious children, determined to spend the rest of their lives together.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The doctors from WHO were selfless, dedicated men and women who devoted their lives to their work. They often worked under nearly impossible circumstances. In Africa, they had to compete with }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 wogesha
}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 \emdash the native medical practitioners whose primitive remedies were passed on from father to son, and often had deadly effects. The Masai's traditional remedy for flesh wounds was }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 olkilorite, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a mixture of cattle blood, raw meat, and essence of a mysterious root.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The Kikuyu remedy for smallpox was to have chil\-dren drive out the sickness with sticks.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You must stop that," Dr. Taylor would tell them. "It doesn't help."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Better than having you stick sharp needles in our skin," they would reply.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The dispensaries were tables lined up under the trees, for surgery. The doctors saw hundreds of patients a day, and there was always a long line waiting to see them\emdash 
 lepers, natives with tubercular lungs, whooping cough, smallpox, dysentery.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Alfred were inseparable. As they grew older, they would walk to the market together, to a village miles away. And they would talk about their plans for the future.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Medicine was a part of Paige's early life. She learned to care for patients, to give shots and dispense medications, and she anticipated ways to help her father.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Paige loved her father. Curt Taylor was the caring, selfless man she had ever known. He genuim liked people, dedicating his life to helping those wl needed him, and he instilled that passion in Paige, spite of the long hours he worked, he managed to time 
to spend with his daughter. He made the discomft of the primitive places they lived in fun.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's relationship with her mother was something else. Her mother was a beauty from a wealthy social background. Her cool aloofness kept Paige at a distance, Marr
ying a doctor who was going to work in far-off exotic places had seemed romantic to her, but the harsh reality had embittered her. She was not a warm, loving woman, and she seemed to Paige always to be complaining.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why did we ever have to come to this godforsaken! place, Curt?"                                                          }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The people here live like animals. We're going catch some of their awful diseases."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why can't you practice medicine in the United States and make money like other doctors?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And on and on it went.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The more her mother criticized him, the more Paige adored her father.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige was fifteen years old, her mother disap\-peared with the owner of a large cocoa plantation in Brazil.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She's not coming back, is she?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, darling. I'm sorry."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm glad!" She had not meant to say that. She was hurt that her mother had cared so little for her and her father that she had abandoned them.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The experience made Paige draw even closer to Al\-fred Turner. They played games together and went on expeditions together, and shared their dreams.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm going to be a doctor, too, when I grow up," Alfred confided. "We'll get married, and we'll work together."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And we'll have lots of children!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sure. If you like."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 On the night of Paige's sixteenth birthday, their life\-long emotional intimacy exploded into a new dimen\-sion. At a little village in East Africa, the doctors had been called away on an emergency, because of an epi\-
demic, and Paige, Alfred, and a cook were the only ones left in camp.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
They had had dinner and gone to bed. But in the middle of the night Paige had been awakened in her tent by the faraway thunder of stampeding animals. She lay there, and as the minutes went by and the sound of the stampede came closer, she began to grow a
fraid. Her breath quickened. There was no telling when her father and the others would return.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \cbpat8 {\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She got up. Alfred's tent was only a few feet away. Terrified, Paige got up, raised the flap of the tent, and ran to Alfred's tent.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was asleep.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Alfred!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He sat up, instantly awake.  "Paige? Is anything wrong?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm frightened. Could I get into bed with you for a while?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sure." They lay there, listening to the animals charging through the brush.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In a few minutes, the sounds began to die away.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alfred became conscious of Paige's warm body lying next to him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paige, I think you'd better go back to your tent." Paige could feel his male hardness pressing against her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 All the physical needs that had been building up within them came boiling to the surface.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Alfred."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes?" His voice was husky.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're getting married, aren't we?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Then it's all right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And the sounds of the jungle around them disap\-peared, and they began to explore and discover a world no one had ever possessed but themselves. They were the 
first lovers in the world, and they gloried in the wonderful miracle of it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At dawn, Paige crept back to her tent and she thought, happily, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm a woman now.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 From time to time, Curt Taylor suggested to Paige that she return to the United States to live with his brother in his beautiful home in Deerfield, north of Chicago.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why?" Paige would ask.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "So that you can grow up to be a proper young lady."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I am a proper young lady."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Proper young ladies don't tease wild monkeys and try to ride baby zebras."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her answer was always the same. "I won't leave you."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige was seventeen, the WHO team went to a jungle village in South Africa to fight a typhoid epi\-demic. Making the situation even more perilous was the fact that shortly after the doctors arrived, war br
oke out between two local tribes. Curt Taylor was warned to leave.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I can't, for God's sake. I have patients who will die if I desert them."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Four days later, the village came under attack. Paige and her father huddled in their little hut, listening to the yelling and the sounds of gunfire outside.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was terrified. "They're going to kill us!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her father had taken her in his arms. "They won't harm us, darling. We're here to help them. They know we're their friends."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And he had been right.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The chief of one of the tribes had burst into the hut with some of his warriors. "Do not worry. We guard you." And they had.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The fighting and shooting finally stopped, but in the morning Curt Taylor made a decision.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He sent a message to his brother. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Sending Paige out on next plane. Will wire details. Please meet her at airport.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was furious when she heard the news. She was taken, sobbing wildly, to the dusty little airport where a Piper Cub was waiting to fly her to a town where she could catch a plane to Johannesburg.
\par "You're sending me away because you want to get rid of me!" she cried.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her father held her close in his arms. "I love you more than anything in the world, baby. I'll miss you every minute. But I'll be going back to the States soon, and we'll be together again."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Promise?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Promise."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alfred was there to see Paige off.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't worry," Alfred told Paige. "I'll come and get you as soon as I can. Will you wait for me?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was a pretty silly question, after all those years.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Of course I will."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Three days later, when Paige's plane arrived at O'Hare Airport in Chicago, Paige's Uncle Richard was there to greet her. Paige had never met him. All she knew about him was that he was a very wealthy busi\-
nessman whose wife had died several years earlier. "He's the successful one in the family," Paige's father}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 always said. Paige's uncle's first words stunned her. "I'm sorry to tell you this, Paige, but I just received word that your father was killed in a native uprising."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her whole world had been shattered in an instant. The ache was so strong that she did not think she could bear it. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
won't let my uncle see me cry, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige vowed. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I won't. I never should have left. I'm going back there.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Driving from the airport, Paige stared out the win\-dow, looking at the heavy traffic.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I hate Chicago."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why, Paige?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a jungle."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Richard would not permit Paige to return to Africa for her father's funeral, and that infuriated her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He tried to reason with her. "Paige, they've already buried your father. There's no point in your going back." But there was a point: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alfred was there.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A few days after Paige arrived, her uncle sat down with her to discuss her future.
\par "There's nothing to discuss," Paige informed him. "I'm going to be a doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At twenty-one, when Paige finished college, she ap\-plied to ten medical schools and was accepted by all of them. She chose a school in Boston.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It took two days to reach Alfred by telephone in Zaire, where he was working part-time with a WHO unit.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige told him the news, he said, "That's wonderful, darling. I'm nearly finished with my medical courses. I'll stay with WHO for a while, but in a few years we'll be practicing together."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Together. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The magical word. "Paige, I'm desperate to see you. If I can get out a few days, could you meet me in Hawaii?" There wasn't the slightest hesitation. "Yes
." And they had both managed it. Later, Paige could ly imagine how difficult it must have been for Alfred to make the long journey, but he never mentioned it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They spent three incredible days at a small hotel in Hawaii, called Sunny Cove, and it was as th
ough they had never been apart. Paige wanted so much to ask Alfred to go back to Boston with her, but she knew how selfish that would have been. The work that he was doing was far more important.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 On their last day together, as they were getting dressed, Paige asked, "Where will they be sending you, Alfred?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Gambia, or maybe Bangladesh." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 To save lives, to help those who so desperately need him. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She held him tightly and closed her eyes. She never wanted to let him go.
\par As though reading her thoughts, he said, "I'll never let you get away."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige started medical school, and she and Alfred cor\-responded regularly. No matter in what part of the world he was, Alfred managed to telephone Paige on her birth\-day and at Christmas. Just before New Year's Eve, when Pa
ige was in her second year of school, Alfred telephoned.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paige?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Darling! Where are you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm in Senegal. I figured out it's only eighty-eight hundred miles from the Sunny Cove hotel."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It took a minute for it to sink in.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you mean . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, yes! Yes!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alfred traveled nearly halfway around the world to meet her, and this time the magic was even stronger. Time had stood still for both of them.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Next year I'll be in charge of my own cadre at WHO," Alfred said. "When you finish school, I want us to get married. ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They were able to get together once more, and when they weren't able to meet, their letters spanned time and space.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 All those years he had worked as a doctor in Third World countries, like his father and Paige's father, do\-ing the wonderful work that they did. And now, at last, he was coming home to her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Paige read Alfred's telegram for the fifth time, she thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He's coming to San Francisco!

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat and Honey were in their bedrooms, asleep. Paige shook them awake. "Alfred's coming! He's coming! He'll be here Sunday!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wonderful," Kat mumbled. "Why don't you wake me up Sunday? I just got to bed."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was more responsive. She sat up and said, "That's great! I'm dying to meet him. How long since you've seen him?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Two years," Paige said, "but we've always stayed in touch."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're a lucky girl," Kat sighed. "Well, we're all awake now. I'll put on some coffee."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The three of them sat around the kitchen table.
\par "Why don't we give Alfred a party?" Honey sug\-gested. "Kind of a 'Welcome to the Groom' party."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's a good idea," Kat agreed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll make it a real celebration\emdash a cake, bal\-loons\emdash the works!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll cook dinner for him here," Honey said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat shook her head. "I've tasted your cooking. Let's send out for food."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Sunday was four days away, and they spent all their spare time discussing Alfred's arrival. By some miracle, the three of them were off duty on Sunday.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Saturday, Paige managed to get to a beauty salon. She went shopping and splurged on a new dress.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do I look all right? Do you think he'll like it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You look sensational!" Honey assured her. "I hope he deserves you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige smiled. "I hope I deserve }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 him. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 You'll love him. He's fantastic!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 On The Sunday, an elaborate lunch they had ordered was laid out on the dining-room table, with a bottle of iced champagne. The women stood around, nervously waiting for Alfred's arrival.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At two o'clock, the doorbell rang, and Paige ran to the door to open it. There was Alfred. A bit tired-looking, a little thinner. But he was her Alfred. Standing next to him was a brunette who appeared to be in her thirties.

\par "Paige!" Alfred exclaimed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige threw her arms around him. Then she turned to Honey and Kat and said proudly, "This is Alfred Turner. Alfred, these are my roommates, Honey Taft and Kat Hunter."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Pleased to meet you," Alfred said. He turned to the woman at his side. "And this is Karen Turner. My wife." The three women s
tood there, frozen. Paige said slowly, "Your wife?" "Yes." He frowned. "Didn't. . . didn't you get my letter?" "Letter?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. I sent it several weeks ago." "No . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh. I ... I'm terribly sorry. I explained it all in my ... but of course, if you didn't
 get the . . ." His voice trailed off. . . . "I'm really sorry, Paige. You and I have been apart so long, that I ... and then I met Karen . . . and you know how it is ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know how it is," Paige said numbly. She turned to Karen and forced a smile. "I ... I hope you and Alfred will be very happy." "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was an awkward silence. Karen said, "I think we had better go, darling." "Yes. I think you had," Kat said. Alfred ran his fingers through his hair. "I'm really sorry, Paige. I ... well . . . goodbye." "Goodbye, Alfred."

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The three women stood there, watching the departing newly weds.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That bastard!" Kat said. "What a lousy thing to do."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's eyes were brimming with tears. "I ... he didn't mean to ... I mean ... he must have explained everything in his letter."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey put her arms around Paige. "There ought to be a law that all men should be castrated."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll drink to that," Kat said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Excuse me," Paige said. She hurried to her bed\-room and closed the door behind her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She did not come out for the rest of the day.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 During the next few months, Pa
ige saw very little of Kat and Honey. They would have a hurried breakfast in the cafeteria and occasionally pass one another in the corridors. They communicated mainly by leaving notes in the apartment.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dinner is in the fridge."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What about the three of us having dinner out Satur\-day night?''
\par 
\par The impossible hours continued to be a punishment, testing the limits of endurance for all the residents.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige welcomed the pressure. It gave her no
 time to think about Alfred and the wonderful future they had planned together. And yet, she could not get him out of her mind. What he had done filled her with a deep pain that refused to go away. She tortured herself with the futile game of "what if?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 What if I had stayed with Alfred in Africa? What if he had come to Chicago with me? What if he had not met Karen? What if . . .?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 On a Friday when Paige went into the change room to put on her scrubs, the word "bitch" had been written on them with a black marker pen.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following day when Paige went to look for her scut book, it was gone. All her notes had disappeared. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Maybe I misplaced it, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 But she couldn't make herself believe it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
The world outside the hospital ceased to exist. Paige was aware that Iraq was pillaging Kuwait, but that was overshadowed by the needs of a fifteen-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia. The day East and West Germany became united, Paige was busy try
ing to save the life of a diabetic patient. Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister of England, but more important, the patient in 214 was able to walk again.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 What made it bearable was the doctors Paige worked with. With few exceptions, they had dedicated them\-
selves to healing others, relieving pain, and saving lives. Paige watched the miracles they performed every day, and it filled her with a sense of pride.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The greatest stress was working in the ER. The emer\-gency room was constantly overcrowded with people suffering every form of trauma imaginable.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The long hours at the hospital and the pressures placed an enormous strain on the doctors and nurses who worked there. The divorce rate among the doctors was extraordinarily high, and extramarital affairs were com\-mon.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Tom Chang was one of those having a problem. He told Paige about it over coffee.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I can handle the hours," Chang confided, "but my wife can't. She complains that she never sees me any\-more and that I'm a stranger to our little girl. She's right. I don't know what to do about it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Has your wife visited the hospital?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why don't you invite her here for lunch, Tom? Let her see what you're doing here and how important it is."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang brightened. "That's a good idea. Thanks, Paige. I will. I would like you to meet her. Will you join us for lunch?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'd love to."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang's wife, Sye, turned out to be a lovely young woman with a classic, timeless beauty. Chang showed her around the hospital, and afterward they had lunch in the cafeteria with Paige.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang had told Paige that Sye had been born and raised in Hong Kong.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How do you like San Francisco?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a small silence. "It's an interesting city," Sye said politely, "but I feel as though I am a stranger here. It is too big, too noisy."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 " But I understand Hong Kong is also big and noisy.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I come from a small village an hour away from Hong Kong. There, there is no noise and no automo\-biles, and everyone knows his neighbors."
 She looked at her husband. "Tom and I and our little daughter were very happy there. It is very beautiful on the island of Llama. It has white beaches and small farms, and nearby is a little fishing village, Sak Kwu Wan. It is so peace\-ful."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her voice was filled with a wistful nostalgia. "My husband and I were together much of the time, as a family should be. Here, I never see him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said, "Mrs. Chang, I know it's difficult for you right now, but in a few years, Tom will be able to set up his own practice, and then his hours will be much easier."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Tom Chang took his wife's hand. "You see? Every\-thing will be fine, Sye. You must be patient."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I understand," she said. There was no conviction in her voice.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As they talked, a man walked into the cafeteria, and as he stood at the door, Paige could see only the back of his head. Her heart started to race. He turned around. It was a complete stranger.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang was watching Paige. "Are you all right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes," Paige lied. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I've got to forget him. It's over. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And yet, the memories of all those wonderful years, the fun, the excitement, the love they had for each other . . . }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 How do I forget all that'? I wonder if I could persuade any of the doctors here to do a lobotomy on me.
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige ran into Honey in the corridor. Honey was out of breath and looked worried.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Is everything all right?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey smiled uneasily. "Yes. Fine." She hurried on.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey had been assigned to an attending physician named Charles Isler, who was known around the hospi\-tal as a martinet.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
On Honey's first day of rounds, he had said, "I've been looking forward to working with you, Dr. Taft. Dr. Wallace has told me about your outstanding record at medical school. I understand you're going to practice internal medicine."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good. So, we'll have you here for three more years."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They began their rounds.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The first patient was a young Mexican boy. Dr. Isler ignored the other residents and turned to Honey. "I think you'll find this an interesting case, Dr. Taft. The patient has all the classic 
signs and symptoms: anorexia, weight loss, metallic taste, fatigue, anemia, hyperirritability, and uncoordination. How would you diagnose it?" He smiled expectantly.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey looked at him a moment. "Well, it could be several things, couldn't it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Isler was watching her, puzzled. "It's a clear-cut case of\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of the other residents broke in, "Lead poison\-ing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's right," Dr. Isler said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey smiled. "Of course. Lead poisoning."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Isler turned to Honey again. "How would you treat it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey said evasively,' 'Well, there are several differ\-ent methods of treatment, aren't there?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A second resident spoke up. "If the patient has had long-term exposure, he should be treated as a potential case of encephalopathy."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Isler nodded. "Right. That's what we're doing. We're correcting the dehydration and electrolyte distur\-bances, and giving him chelation therapy."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at Honey. She nodded in agreement.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next patient was a man in his eighties. His eyes were red and his eyelids were stuck together.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll have your eyes taken care of in a moment," Dr. Isler assured him. "How are you feeling?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, not too bad for an old man."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Isler pulled aside the blanket to reveal the pa\-tient's swollen knee and ankle. There were lesions on the soles of his feet.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Isler turned to the residents. "The swelling is caused by arthritis." He looked at Honey. "Combined with the lesions and the conjunctivitis, I'm sure you know what the diagnosis is."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey said slowly, "Well, it could be ... you know . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's Reiter's syndrome," one of the residents spoke up. "The cause is unknown. It's usually accompanied by low-grade fever."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Isler nodded. "That's right." He looked at Honey. "What is the prognosis?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The prognosis?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The other resident replied. ' 'The prognosis is unclear. It can be treated with anti-inflammation drugs."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Very good," Dr. Isler said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They made the rounds of a dozen more patients, and when they were finished, Honey said to Dr. Isler, "Could I see you for a moment alone, Dr. Isler?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. Come into my office."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they were seated in his office, Honey said, "I know you're disappointed in me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I must admit that I was a little surprised that you\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey interrupted. "I know, Dr. Isler. I didn't close my eyes last night. To tell you the truth, I was so excited about working with you that I... I just couldn't sleep."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at her in surprise. "Oh. I see. I knew there had to be a reason for ... I mean, your medical school record was so fantastic. What made you decide to be\-come a doctor?"
\par Honey looked down for a moment, then said softly, "I had a younger brother who was injured in an acci\-dent. The doctors did e
verything they could to try to save him ... but I watched him die. It took a long time, and I felt so helpless. I decided then that I was going to spend my life helping other people get well." Her eyes welled up with tears.
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She's so vulnerable, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Isler thought. "I'm glad we had this little talk." Honey looked at him and thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He believed me.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

Across town, in another part of the city, reporters and TV crews were waiting in the street for Lou Dinetto as he left the courtroom, smiling and waving, the greeting of royalty to the peasants. There were two bodyguards at his side, a tall, thin man know
n as the Shadow, and a heavy set man called Rhino. Lou Dinetto was, as always, dressed elegantly and expen\-
sively, in a gray silk suit with a white shirt, blue tie, and alligator shoes. His clothes had to be carefully tailored to make him look trim, because
 he was short and stout, with bandy legs. He always had a smile and a ready quip for the press, and they enjoyed quoting him. Dinetto had been indicted and tried three times on charges ranging from arson to racketeering to murder, and each time had gone f
ree.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Now as he left the courtroom, one of the reporters yelled out, "Did you know you were going to be acquit\-ted, Mr. Dinetto?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dinetto laughed. "Of course I did. I'm an innocent businessman. The government has got nothing better to do than to persecute me. That's one of the reasons our taxes are so high."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A TV camera was aimed at him. Lou Dinetto stopped to smile into it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mr. Dinetto, can you explain why two witnesses who were scheduled to testify against you in your mur\-der trial failed to appear?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Certainly I can explain it," Dinetto said. "They were honest citizens who decided not to perjure them\-selves."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And Lou Dinetto was in the car, waving and smiling. Rhino closed the door of the limousine and got into the front seat. The Shadow slipped behind the wheel.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 'That was great, boss!" Rhino said. "You sure know how to handle them bums."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't like that question about the witnesses," Dinetto said. "You sure they'll never . . .?" "Not unless they can talk underwater, boss." Dinetto nodded. "Good."

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
A small dog appeared out of nowhere, directly in front of the limousine. The Shadow swung the wheel hard to avoid hitting it and jammed on the brakes. The car jumped the curb and crashed into a lamppost. Rhino's head flew forward into the windshield.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Rhino was moaning. He turned around, and Dinetto saw blood pouring from a large cut in his forehead.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
"I'm all right," Rhino mumbled. "The hell you are!" Dinetto turned to the Shadow. "Get him to a hospital." The Shadow backed the limousine off the curb. "The Embarcadero is only a couple of blocks down. We'll take him to the emergency ward there."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was in the emergency ward when Dinetto, the Shadow, and Rhino walked in. Rhino was bleeding heavily.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The Shadow said, "Lady, you don't know who you're talking to. You better do what the man says. This is Mr. Lou Dinetto."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Now that the introductions are over," Dinetto said impatiently, "take care of my man."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll do my best." Kat sat Rhino down on a cot. "Lie down. I'll be back in a few minutes." She looked at Dinetto. "There are some chairs over there in the corner.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dinetto and the Shadow watched her walk to the other end of the ward to take care of the waiting patients.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Jesus," the Shadow said. "She has no idea who you are."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Fifteen minutes later, Kat returned to Rhino and ex\-amined him. "No concussion," she announced. "You're lucky. That's a nasty cut."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dinetto stood watching as Kat skillfully put stitches in Rhino's forehead.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Kat was finished, she said, "That should heal nicely. Come back in five days, and I'll take out the stitches."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dinetto walked over and examined Rhino's forehead. "That's a damn good job."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks," Kat said. "Now, if you'll excuse me . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Hospitals are run by nurses. Margaret Spencer, the chief nurse, had worked at Embarcadero County Hospital for twenty years and knew where all the bodies\emdash literally and figuratively\emdash 
were buried. Nurse Spencer was in charge of the hospital, and doctors who did not recognize it were in trouble. She knew which doctors were on drugs or addicted to alcohol, which doctors were incompetent, and which doctors deserved her support. In her cha
r
ge were all the student nurses, registered nurses, and operating room nurses. It was Margaret Spencer who decided which of them would be assigned to the various surgeries, and since the nurses ranged from indispensable to incompetent, it paid the doctors 
t
o get along with her. She had the power to assign an inept scrub nurse to assist on a complicated kidney removal, or, if she liked the doctor, to send her most competent nurse to help him with a simple tonsillectomy. Among Margaret Spencer's many prejudic
es was  an antipathy to women doctors and to blacks. Kat Hunter was a black woman doctor.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Kat was having a hard time. Nothing was overtly said or done, and yet prejudice was at work in ways too subtle to pin down. The nurses she asked for were unavailable, those assigned to her were close to incompetent. Kat found herself frequently being sent
 to examine male clinic patients with venereal dis\-eases. She accepted the first few cases as routine, but when she was given half a dozen to examine in one day, she became suspicious.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At a lunch break she said to Paige, "Have you exam\-ined many men with venereal disease?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought for a moment. "One last week. An orderly."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to have to do something about this, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat thought.
\par Nurse Spencer had planned to get rid of Dr. Hunter by making her life so miserable that she would be forced to quit, but s
he had not counted on Kat's dedication or her ability. Little by little, Kat was winning over the people she worked with. She had a natural skill that impressed her fellow workers as well as her patients. But the real breakthrough happened because of what
 came to be known around the hospital as the famous pig blood caper.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 On morning rounds one day, Kat was working with a senior resident named Dundas. They were at the bed\-side of a patient who was unconscious.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mr. Levy was in an automobile accident," Dund
as informed the younger residents. "He's lost a great deal of blood, and he needs an immediate transfusion. The hospital is short of blood right now. This man has a family, and they refuse to donate any blood to him. It's infuriating."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat asked, "Where is his family?" "In the visitors' waiting room," Dr. Dundas said. "Do you mind if I talk to them?" Kat asked. "It won't do any good. I've already spoken to them. They've made up their minds."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When the rounds were over, Kat went into the visi\-tors' waiting room. The man's wife and grown son and daughter were there. The son wore a yarmulke and ritual tallis.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mrs. Levy?" Kat asked the woman. She stood up. "How is my husband? Is the doctor going to operate?" "Yes," Kat said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, don't ask us to give any of our blood. It's much too dangerous these days, with AIDS and all." "Mrs. Levy," Kat said, "you can't get AIDS by donating blood. It's not poss\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't tell me! I read the papers. I know what's what."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat studied her a moment. "I can see that. Well, it's all right, Mrs. Levy. The hospital is short of blood right now, but we've solved the problem."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're going to give your husband pig's blood."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The mother and son were staring at Kat, shocked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Pig's blood," Kat said cheerfully. "It probably won't do him any harm." She turned to leave.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wait a minute!" Mrs. Levy cried.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat stopped. "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I, uh . . . just give us a minute, will you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Certainly."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Fifteen minutes later, Kat went up to Dr. Dundas. "You don't have to worry about Mr. Levy's family anymore. They're all happy to make a blood donation."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The story became an instant legend around the hospi\-tal. Doctors and nurses who had ignored Kat before made a point of speaking to her.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A few days later, Kat went into the private room of Tom Leonard, an ulcer patient. He was eating an enormous lunch that he had had brought in from a nearby delicatessen.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat walked up to his bed. "What are you doing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked up and smiled. "Having a decent lunch for a change. Want to join me? There's plenty here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat rang for a nurse.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Get this food out of here. Mr. Leonard is on a strict hospital diet. Didn't you read his chart?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You'll eat it if you want to get rid of your ulcer." Kat looked at the nurse. "Take it out."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Thirty minutes later, Kat was summoned to the office of the administrator.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace leaned forward in his chair. "Doctor, you probably were not aware that Tom Leonard is on the hospital's supervisory board. We want to keep him happy. Do you get my meaning?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat looked at him and said stubbornly, "No, sir."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It seems to me that the way to keep Tom Leonard happy is to get him healthy. He's not going to be cured if he tears his stomach apart."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Benjamin Wallace forced a smile. "Why don't we let him make that decision?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat stood up. "Because }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 his doctor. Is there any\-thing else?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was on night duty when she received a call. "Dr. Hunter, I think you had better come up to 320."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The patient in Room 320 was Mrs. Molloy, a cancer patient in her eighties, with a poor prognosis. As Kat neared the door she heard voices inside, raised in argu\-ment. Kat stepped inside the room.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mrs. Molloy was in bed, heavily sedated, but con\-scious. Her son and two daughters were in the room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Isler had been looking forward to working with Honey Taft again. He had forgiven her inept perfor\-
mance and, in fact, was flattered that she was in such awe of him. But now, on rounds with her once more, Honey stayed behind the other residents and never vol\-unteered an answer to his questions.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Thirty minutes after rounds, Dr. Isler was seated in Benjamin Wallace's office.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's the problem?" Wallace asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

Honey Taft had the bad fortune to have been born into a family of overachievers. Her handsome father was the founder and president of a large computer company in Memphis, Tennessee, her lovely mother was a genetic scientist, and Honey's older twin sisters
 were as attractive, as brainy, and as ambitious as their parents. The Tafts were among the most prominent families in Memphis.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey had inconveniently come along when her sis\-ters were six years old.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Honey was our little accident," her mother would tell their friends. "I wanted to have an abortion, but Fred was against it. Now he's sorry."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Where Honey's sisters were stunning, Honey was plain. Where they were brilliant, Honey was average.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her sisters had started talking at nine months. Honey had not uttered a word until she was almost two.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We call her 'the dummy,' " her father would laugh.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Honey is the ugly duckling of the Taft family. Only I don't think she's going to turn into a swan."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was not that Honey was ugly, but neither was she pretty. She was ordinary-looking, with a thin, pinched face, mousy blond hair, and an unenviable figure. What Honey }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 did }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
have was an extraordinarily sweet, sunny disposition, a quality not particularly prized in a family of competitive overachievers.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 From the earlies
t time Honey could remember, her greatest desire was to please her parents and sisters and make them love her. It was a futile effort. Her parents were busy with their careers, and her sisters were busy winning beauty contests and scholarships. To add to 
Honey's misery, she was inordinately shy. Consciously or unconsciously, her family had implanted in her a feeling of deep inferiority.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In high school, Honey was known as the Wallflower. She attended school dances and parties by herself, and smiled and trie
d not to show how miserable she was, because she did not want to spoil anyone's fun. She would watch her sisters picked up at the house by the most popular boys at school, and then she would go up to her lonely room to struggle with her homework.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And try not to cry.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 On weekends and during the summer holidays, Honey made pocket money by baby-sitting. She loved taking care of children, and the children adored her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Honey was not working, she would go off and explore Memphis by herself. She visited Gracel
and, where Elvis Presley had lived, and walked down Beale Street, where the blues started. She wandered through the Pink Palace Museum, and the Planetarium, with its roaring, stomping dinosaur. She went to the aquarium.
\par 
\par And Honey was always alone.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was unaware that her life was about to change drastically.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey knew that many of her classmates were having love affairs. They discussed it constantly at school.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Have you gone to bed with Ricky yet? He's the best... !"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Joe is really into orgasms ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I was out with Tony last night. I'm exhausted. What an animal! I'm seeing him again tonight ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey stood there listening to their conversations, and she was filled with a bittersweet envy, and a feeling that she would never know what sex was like. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Who would want me? }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey wondered.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One Friday night, there was a school prom. Honey had no intention of going, but her father said, "You know, I'm concerned. Your sisters tell me that you're a wallflower, and that you're not going to the prom because you ca
n't get a date."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey blushed. "That's not true," she said. "I do have a date, and I }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 am }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 going." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Don't let him ask who }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 my }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 date is, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey prayed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He didn't.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Now Honey found herself at the prom, seated in her usual corner, watching the others dancing and having a wonderful time.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And that was when the miracle occurred.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Roger Merton, the captain of the football team and the most popular boy at school, was on the
 dance floor, having a fight with his girlfriend. He had been drinking. "You're a no-good, selfish bastard!" she said. "And you're a dumb bitch!" "You can go screw yourself." "I don't have to screw myself, Sally. I can screw somebody else. Anyone I want t
o."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Go ahead!" She stormed off the dance floor. Honey could not help but overhear. Merton saw her looking at him. "What the hell are you staring at?" He was slurring his words. "Nothing," Honey said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll show the bitch! You think I won't show her?" "I ... yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Damn right. Let's have a li'l drink." Honey   hesitated.   Merton was obviously   drunk. "Well, I don't ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Great. I have a bottle in the car." "I really don't think I ..." And he had Honey's arm and was steering her out of the room. She went along because she did not want to make a scene and embarrass him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Outside, Honey tried to pull away. "Roger, I don't think this is a good idea. I . . ." "What the hell are you\emdash chicken?" "No, I ..." "Okay, then. Come on."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He led her to his car and opened the door. Honey stood there a moment. "Get in."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I can only stay a moment," Honey said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She got in the car because she did not want to upset Roger. He climbed in beside her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're going to show that dumb broad, aren't we?" He held out a bottle of bourbon. "Here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey had had only one drink of alcohol before and she had hated it. But she did not want to hurt Roger's feelings. She looked at him and reluctantly took a small sip.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're okay," he said. "You're new at school, huh?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was in three of his classes. "No," Honey said. I ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He leaned over and began to play with her breasts.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Startled, Honey pulled away.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hey! Come on. Don't you want to please me?" he said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And that was the magic phrase. Honey wanted to please everybody, and if this was the way to do it . . .
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the uncomfortable backseat of Merton's car, Honey had sex for the first time, and it opened an incred\-ible new world to her. She did not particularly enjoy the sex, but that was not important. The important thi
ng was that Merton enjoyed it. In fact, Honey was amazed by how }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 much }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he enjoyed it. It seemed to make him ecstatic. She had never seen anyone enjoy anything so much. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
So this is how to please a man, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was an epiphany.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was unable to get the miracle of what had occurred out of her mind. She lay in bed, remembering Merton's hard maleness inside her, thrusting faster and}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 faster, and then his moans, "Oh, yes, yes, you're fantastic, Sally ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And Honey had not even minded that. She had pleased the captain of the football team! The most popu\-lar boy in school! }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And I really didn't even know what I was doing, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Honey thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'll}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 truly learned how to please a man . . .}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And that was when Honey had her second epiphany.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following morning, Hon
ey went to the Pleasure Chest, a porno bookstore on Poplar Street, and bought half a dozen books on eroticism. She smuggled them home and read them in the privacy of her room. She was astounded by what she was reading.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She raced through the pages of }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The Perfumed Garden }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 and the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kama Sutra, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Tibetan Arts of Love, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Al\-chemy of Ecstasy, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 and then went back for more. She read the words of Gedun Chopel and the arcane accounts by Kanchinatha.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She studied the exciting photographs of the thirty-seven positions of lovemaking, and she learned the meaning of the Half Moon and the Circle, the Lotus Petal, and the Pieces of Cloud, and the way of churning.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey became an expert on the eight types of oral sex, and the paths of the sixteen pleasures, and the ecstasy of the string of marbles. She knew how to teach a man to perform }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 karuna, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 to intensify his pleasure. In theory, at least.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey felt she was now ready to put her knowledge into practice.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kama Sutra }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 had several chapters on aphrodisiacs to arouse a man, but since Honey had no idea where she could obtain }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Hedysarum gangeticum, }
{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 kshirika }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 plant, or the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Xanthochymus pictorius, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she figured out her own substitutes.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Honey saw Roger Merton in class the following week, she walked up to him and said, "I really enjoyed the other night. Can we do it again?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It took him a moment to remember who Honey was. "Oh. Sure. Why not? My folks are out tonight. Why don't you come by about eight o'clock?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Honey arrived at Merton's house that night, she had a small jar of maple syrup with her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's that for?" Merton asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm going to show you," Honey said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She showed him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next day, Merton was telling his buddies at school about Honey.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She's incredible," he said. "You wouldn't believe what she can do with a little warm syrup!"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That afternoon, half a dozen boys were asking Honey for dates. From that time on, she started going out every night. The boys were very happy, and that made Honey very happy.
\par Honey's parents were delighted by their daughter's sudden popularity.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It took our girl a little while to bloom," her father said proudly, "but now she's turned into a real Taft!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey had always had poor grades in mathematics, and she knew she had failed badly on her final test. Her mathematics teacher, Mr. Janson, was a bachelor and lived near the school. Honey paid him a visit one eve\-
ning. He opened the door and looked at her in surprise.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Honey! What are you doing here?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I need your help," Honey said. "My father will kill me if I fail your course. I brought some math prob\-lems, and I wonder if you would mind going over them with me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He hesitated a moment. "This is unusual, but . . . very well."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mr. Janson liked Honey. She was not like the other girls in his class. They were raucous and indifferent, while Honey was sensitive and caring, always eager to please. He wished that she had more of an aptitude for mathematics.}
{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mr. Janson sat next to Honey on the couch and began to explain the arcane intricacies of logarithms.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was not interested in logarithms. As Mr. Jan\-son talked, Honey moved closer and closer to him. She started breathing on his neck and into his ear, and before he knew what was happening, Mr. Janson found that his pants 
were unzipped.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was looking at Honey in astonishment. "What are you doing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I've wanted you since the first time I saw you," Honey said. She opened her purse and took out a small can of whipped cream.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let me show you ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey received an A in math.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
It was not only the accessories Honey used that made her so popular. It was the knowledge she had gleaned from all the ancient books on erotica she had read. She delighted her partners with techniques they had never even dreamed of, that we
re thousands of years old, and long forgotten. She brought a new meaning to the word "ecstasy."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey's grades improved dramatically, and she was suddenly even more popular than her sisters had been in their high school days. Honey was dined at the Privat
e Eye and the Bombay Bicycle Club, and taken to the Ice Capades at the Memphis Mall. The boys took her skiing at Cedar Cliff and sky diving at Landis Airport.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey's years at college were just as successful so\-cially. At dinner one evening, her father said, "You'll be graduating soon. It's time to think about your future. Do you know what you want to do with your life?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She answered immediately. "I want to be a nurse."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her father's face reddened. "You mean a doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, Father. I . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're a Taft. If you want to go into medicine, you'll be a doctor. Is that understood?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, Father."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey had meant it when she told her father she wanted to be a nurse. She loved taking care of people, helping them and nur
turing them. She was terrified by the idea of becoming a doctor, and being responsible for people's lives. But she knew that she must not disap\-point her father. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 You're a Taft.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey's college grades were not good enough to get her into medical school, but her father's influence was. He was a heavy contributor to a medical school in Knoxville, Tennessee. He met with Dr. Jim Pearson, the dean.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're asking for a big favor," Pearson said, "but I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll admit Honey on a probation\-ary basis. If at the end of six months we feel she's not qualified to continue, we'll have to let her go."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fair enough. She's going to surprise you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was right.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey's father had made arrangements for her to stay in Knoxville with a cousin of his, the Reverend Douglas Lipton.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Douglas Lipton was the minister of the Baptist Church. He was in his sixties, married to a woman ten years older.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The minister was delighted to have Honey in the house.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She's like a breath of fresh air," he told his wife.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He had never seen anyone so eager to please.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey did fairly well in medical school, but she lacked dedication. She was there only to please her father.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey's teachers liked her. There was a genuine nice-ness about her that made her professors want her to succeed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ironically, she was particularly weak in anatomy. During the eighth week, her anatomy teacher sent for her. "I'm afraid I'm going to have to fail you," he said unhappily.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 can't fail, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
can't let my father down. What would Boccaccio have advised"?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey moved closer to the professor. "I came to this school because of you. I had heard so much about you." She moved closer to him. "
I want to be like you." And closer. "Being a doctor means everything to me." And closer. "Please help me . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One hour later, when Honey left his office, she had the answers to the next examination.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Before Honey was finished with medical school, she had seduced several of her professors. There was a helplessness about her that they were unable to resist. They were all under the impression that it was }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 they }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 who were seducing }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 her, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 and they felt guilty about taking advantage of her innocence.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Jim Pearson was the last to succumb to Honey. He was intrigued by all the reports he had heard about her. There were rumors of her extraordinary sexual skills. He sent for Honey one day to discuss her grades. She
 brought a small box of powdered sugar with her, and before the afternoon was over, Dr. Pearson was as hooked as all the others. Honey made him feel young and insatiable. She made him feel that he was a king who had subjugated her and made her his slave.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He tried not to think of his wife and children.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was genuinely fond of the Reverend Douglas Lipton, and it upset her that his wife was a cold, frigid woman who was always criticizing him. Honey felt sorry for the minister. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
He doesn't deserve that, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He needs comforting.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the middle of the night, when Mrs. Lipton was out of town visiting a sister, Honey walked into the minister's bedroom. She was naked. "Douglas . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 His eyes flew open. "Honey? Are you all right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No," she said. "Can I talk to you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Of course." He reached for the lamp.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't turn on the light." She crept into bed beside him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's the matter? Aren't you feeling well?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm worried."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "About what?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You. You deserve to be loved. I want to make love to you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was wide awake. "My God!" he said. "You're just a child. You can't be serious."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I am. Your wife's not giving you any love. ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Honey, this is impossible! You'd better get back to your room now, and ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He could feel her naked body pressing against his. "Honey, we can't do this. I'm ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her lips were on his, and her body was on top of him, and he was completely swept away. She spent the night in his bed.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At six o'clock in the morning, the door to the bed-room opened and Mrs. Lipton walked in. She stood there, staring at the two of them, then walked out with\-out a word.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Two hours later, the Reverend Douglas Lipton com\-mitted suicide in his garage.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Honey heard the news, she was devastated, unable to believe what had happened.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The sheriff arrived at the house and had a talk with Mrs. Lipton.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When he was through, he went to find Honey. "Out of respect for his family, we're going to list the death of the Reverend Douglas Lipton as a 'suicide for reasons unknown,' but I would sugge
st that you get the fuck out of this town fast, and stay out."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey had gone to Embarcadero County Hospital in San Francisco.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Time had lost all meaning for Paige. There was no beg
inning and no end, and the days and nights flowed into one another in a seamless rhythm. The hospital had become her whole life. The outside world was a foreign, faraway planet.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Christmas came and went, and a new year began. In the world outside, U.S. troops liberated Kuwait from Iraq.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was no word from Alfred. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He'll find out he made a mistake, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He'll come back to me.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
The early morning crank telephone calls had stopped as suddenly as they had started. Paige was relieved that no new mysterious or threatening incidents had befallen her. It was almost as if they had all been a bad dream . . . except, of course, they hadn'
t been.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The routine continued to be frantic. There was no time to know patients. They were simply gallbladders and ruptured livers, fractured femurs and broken backs.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The hospital was a jungle filled with mechanical demons\emdash respirators, heart rate monitors, CAT scan equipment, X-ray machines. And each had its own pe\-
culiar sound. There were whistles, and buzzers, and the constant chatter on the PA system, and they all blended into a loud, insane cacophony.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The second year of residency was a rite of passage. The residents moved up to more demanding duties and watched the new group come in, feeling a mixture of scorn and arrogance toward them.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Those poor devils," Kat said to Paige. "They have no idea what they're in for."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "They'll find out soon enough."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Honey were becoming worried about Kat. She was losing weight, and seemed depressed. In the middle of conversations, they would find Kat looking off into space, her mind preoccupied. From time to time, she would recei
ve a mysterious phone call, and after each one her depression seemed to worsen.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Honey sat down to have a talk with her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Is everything all right?" Paige asked. "You know we love you, and if there's a problem, we'd like to help."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks. I appreciate it, but there's nothing you can do. It's a money problem."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey looked at her in surprise. "What do you need money for? We never go anyplace. We haven't any time to buy anything. We\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's not for me. It's for my brother." Kat had not mentioned her brother before.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I didn't know you had a brother," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Does he live in San Francisco?" Honey asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was hesitant. "No. He lives back East. In Detroit. You'll have to meet him one day."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's kind of an entrepreneur," Kat said vaguely. "He's a little down on his luck right now, but Mike will bounce back. He always does." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One day, he said to Paige, "I'm giving a little party tomorrow night. If you and Dr. Hunter and Dr. Taft are free, why don't you come? I think you'll have a good time."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bowman's little apartment turned out to be a ten-room penthouse, filled with antique furniture.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The three women walked in and stared in amazement.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The buffet consisted of Beluga Malossol caviar, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 pate de campagne, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 smoked Scottish salmon, oysters on the half shell, backfin lump crabmeat, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
crudites }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 with a shal\-lot vinaigrette dressing, and Cristal champagne.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat got out of bed, fighting exhaustion. Rubbing sleep from her eyes, she took the elevator down to the ER.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat took a deep breath. "A golf tournament."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yeah."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was fighting to control herself. "I'll tell you what. Go home. Take two aspirins, and if you aren't feeling better in the morning give me a call." She turned and stormed out of the room, leaving him gaping after her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Harry Bowman's little motorboat was a sleek fifty-foot motor cruiser.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Welcome aboard!" he said as he greeted Paige, Kat, and Honey at the dock.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey looked at the boat admiringly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's beautiful," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They cruised around the bay for three hours, enjoying the warm, sunny day. It was the first time any of them had relaxed in weeks.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 While they were anchored off Angel Island, eating a delicious lunch, Kat said, "This is the life. Let's not go back to shore."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good thinking," Honey said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 All in all, it was a heavenly day.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they returned to the dock, Paige said, "I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed this."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's been my pleasure." Bowman patted her arm.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll do it again. Anytime. You three are always welcome." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 What a lovely man, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey liked working in obstetrics. It was a ward filled with new life and new hope, in a timeless, joyful ritual.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The first-time mothers were eager and apprehensive. The veterans could not wait to get it over with.
\par One of the women who was about to deliver said to Honey, "Thank God! I'll be able to see my toes again."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 If Paige had kept a diary, she would have marked the fifteenth of August as a red-letter day. That was the day Jimmy Ford came into her life.
\par Jimmy was a hospital orderly,
 with the brightest smile and the sunniest disposition Paige had ever seen. He was small and thin, and looked seventeen. He was twenty-five, and moved around the hospital corridors like a cheerful tornado. Nothing was too much trouble for him.
\par He was constantly running errands for everyone. He had absolutely no sense of status and treated doctors, nurses, and janitors alike.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jimmy Ford loved to tell jokes.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did you hear about the patient in a body cast? The fellow in the bed next to him asked him what he did for a living.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He said, 'I was a window washer at the Empire State Building.'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The other fellow said, 'When did you quit?'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 " 'Halfway down.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And Jimmy would grin and hurry off to help some\-body.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He adored Paige. "I'm going to be a doctor one day. I want to be like you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He would bring her little presents\emdash candy bars, and stuffed toys. A joke went with each gift.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "In Houston, a man stopped a pedestrian and asked, 'What's the quickest way to the hospital?'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 " 'Say something bad about Texas.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The jokes were terrible, but Jimmy made them sound funny.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He would arrive at the hospital the same time as Paige, and he would race up to her on his motorcycle.
\par "The patient asked, 'Will my operation be danger\-ous?'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And the surgeon said, 'No. You can't get a danger\-ous operation for two hundred dollars.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And he would be gone.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Whenever Paige, Kat, and Honey were free on the same day, they went out exploring San Fran
cisco. They visited the Dutch Mill and the Japanese Tea Garden. They went to Fisherman's Wharf and rode the cable car. They went to see plays at the Curran Theater, and had dinner at the Maharani on Post Street. All the wait\-
ers were Indian, and to the astonishment of Kat and Honey, Paige addressed them in Hindi.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hum Hindustani bant bahut ocho bolta hi." }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And from that moment, the restaurant was theirs.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Where in the world did you learn to talk Indian?" Honey asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hindi," Paige said. She hesitated. "We ... I lived in India for a while." It was still so vivid. She and Alfred were at Agra, staring at the Taj Mahal. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Shah Jahan built that for his wife. It took twenty years, Alfred.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to build you a Taj Mahal. I don't care how long it takes!}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This is Karen Turner. My wife.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She heard her name called, and turned.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paige ..." There was a look of concern on Kat's face. "Are you all right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fine. I'm fine."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The impossible hours continued. Another New Year's Eve came and went, and the second year slid into the third, and nothing had changed. The hospital was un\-
touched by the outside world. The wars and famines and disasters of far-off countries paled by comparison with the life-and-death crises they coped with twenty-four hours a day.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Whenever Kat and Paige met in the hospital corridors, Kat would grin and say, "Having a good time?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "When did you sleep last?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat sighed. "Who can remember?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They stumbled through the long days and nights, trying to keep up with the incessant, demanding pres\-sure, grabbing sandwiches when they had time, and drinking cold coffee out of paper cups.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The sexual harassment seemed to have become a part of Kat's life. There were the constant innuendos not only from the doctors, but also from patients who tried to get her into bed. They got the same response as the doctors. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There's not a man in the world I'll let touch me.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And she really believed it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the middle of a busy morning, there was another telephone call from Mike.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hi, sis."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And Kat knew what was coming. She had sent him all the money she could spare, but deep down inside, she knew that whatever she sent would never be enough.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I hate like hell to bother you, Kat. I really do. But I got into a small jam." His voice sounded strained.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mike . . . are you all right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, yeah. It's nothing serious. It's just that I owe somebody who needs his money back right away, and I was wondering ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll see what I can do," Kat said wearily.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks. I can always count on you, can't I, sis? I love you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I love you, too, Mike."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One day, Kat said to Paige and Honey, "Do you know what we all need?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A month's sleep?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A vacation. That's where we should be, strolling down the Champs Elysees, looking in all those expen\-sive shop windows."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right. First-class all the way!" Paige giggled. "We'll sleep all day and play all night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey laughed. "Sounds good."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We have some vacation time coming up in a few months," Paige observed. "Why don't we make some plans for the three of us to go away somewhere?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's a great idea," Kat said enthusiastically. "Saturday, let's stop in at a travel agency."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They \'84 spent the next three days excitedly making plans.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm dying to see London. Maybe we'll run into the queen."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paris is where I want to go. It's supposed to be the most romantic city in the world."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I want to ride a gondola in the moonlight in Ven\-ice."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Maybe we'll go to Venice on our honeymoon, Paige, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alfred had said. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Would you like that?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Oh, yes!}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She wondered if Alfred had taken Karen to Venice on their honeymoon.
\par 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Saturday morning the three of them stopped in at the Corniche Travel Agency on Powell Street.
\par The woman behind the counter was polite. "What kind of trip are you interested in?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'd like to go to Europe\emdash London, Paris, Ven\-ice . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Lovely. We have some economical package tours that\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, no, no." Paige looked at Honey and grinned. "First-class."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right. First-class air travel," Kat chimed in.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "First-class hotels," Honey added.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, I can recommend the Ritz in London, the Crillon in Paris, the Cipriani in Venice, and\emdash "  
\par Paige said, "Why don't we just take some brochures with us? We can study them and make up our minds."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That will be fine," the travel agent said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was looking at a brochure. "You arrange yacht charters, too?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good. We may be chartering one."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Excellent." The travel agent collected a handful of brochures and handed them to Paige. "Whenever you're ready, just let me know and I'll be happy to make your reservations."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You'll hear from us," Honey promised.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they got outside, Kat laughed and said, "Noth\-ing like dreaming big, is there?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

Seymour Wilson, the chief of medicine at Embarcadero County Hospital, was a frustrated man with an impossible job. There were too many patients, too few doctors and nurses, and too few hours in a day. He felt like the captain of a sinking ship, running ar
ound vainly trying to plug up the holes.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At the moment, Dr. Wilson's immediate concern was Honey Taft. While some doctors seemed to like her a great deal, reliable residents and nurses kept reporting that Dr. Taft was incapable of doing her job.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wilson finally went to see Ben Wallace. "I want to get rid of one of our doctors," he said. "The residents she makes rounds with tell me she's incompetent."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace remembered Honey. She was the one who had the extraordinarily high grades and glowing recom\-mendati
on. "I don't understand it," he said. "There must be some mistake." He was thoughtful for a moment. "I'll tell you what we'll do, Seymour. Who's the meanest son of a bitch on your staff?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ted Allison."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right. Tomorrow morning, send Honey Taft out on rounds with Dr. Allison. Have him give you a report on her. If he says she's incompetent, I'll get rid of her."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fair enough," Dr. Wilson said. "Thanks, Ben."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At lunch, Honey told Paige that she had been assigned to make the rounds with Dr. Allison the following morn\-ing.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know him," Paige said. "He has a miserable reputation."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's what I hear," Honey said thoughtfully.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At that moment, in another part of the hospital, Sey\-mour Wilson was talking to Ted Allison. Allison was a hard-bitten vetera
n of twenty-five years. He had served as a medical officer in the navy, and he still took pride in "kicking ass."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Seymour Wilson was saying, "I want you to keep a close eye on Dr. Taft. If she can't cut it, she's out. Understood?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Understood."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was looking forward to this. Like Seymour Wil\-son, Ted Allison despised incompetent doctors. In addi\-
tion, he had a strong conviction that if women wanted to be in the medical profession, they should be nurses. If it was good enough for Florence Nightingale, it was good enough for the rest of them.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At six o'clock the following morning, the residents gathered in the corridor to begin their rounds. The group consisted of Dr. Allison, Tom Benson, who was his chief assistant, and five residents, including Honey Taft.
\par Now, as Allison looked at Honey, he thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Okay, sister, let's see what you've got. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He turned to the group. "Let's go."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The first patient in Ward One was a teenage girl lying in bed, covered with heavy blankets. She was asleep when the group approached her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right," Dr. Allison said. "I want you all to take a look at her chart."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The residents began to study the patient's chart. Dr. Allison turned to Honey. "This patient has fever, chills, general malaise, and anorexia. She has a temperature, a cough, and pneumonia. What's your diagnosis, Dr. Taft?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey stood there, frowning, silent.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well," Honey said thoughtfully, "I would say she probably has  psittacosis\emdash parrot fever."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Allison was looking at her in surprise. "What . . . what makes you say that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Her symptoms are typical of psittacosis, and I no\-ticed that she works part-time as a clerk in a pet shop. Psittacosis is transmitted by infected parrots."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Allison nodded slowly. "That's . . . that's very good. Do you know what the treatment is?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. Tetracycline for ten days, strict bed rest, and plenty of fluids."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Allison turned to the group, "Did you all hear that? Dr. Taft is absolutely right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They moved on to the next patient.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Allison said, "If you'll examine his chart, you'll find that he has mesothelial tumors, bloody effusion, and fatigue. What's the diagnosis?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of the residents said, hopefully, "It sounds like some form of pneumonia."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A second resident spoke up. "It could be cancer."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Allison turned to Honey. "What is your diagno\-sis, doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey looked thoughtful. "Offhand, I'd say it was fibrous pneumoconiosis, a form of asbestos poisoning. His chart shows that he works in a carpet mill."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ted Allison could not conceal his admiration. "Ex\-cellent! Excellent! Do you happen to know what the therapy is?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Unfortunately, no specific therapy is available yet."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It became even more impressive. In the next two hours, Honey diagnosed a rare case of Reiter's syn\-drome, osteitis deformans polycythemia, and malaria.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When the rounds were over, Dr. Allison shook Honey's hand. "I'm not easily impressed, doctor, but I want to tell you that you have a tremendous future!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey blushed. "Thank you, Dr. Allison."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And I intend to tell Ben Wallace so," he said as he walked away.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Tom Benson, Allison's senior assistant, looked at Honey and smiled. "I'll meet you in half an hour, baby."

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige tried to stay out of the way of Dr. Arthur Kane\emdash 007. But at every opportunity, Kane asked for Paige to assist him with operations. And each time, he would become more offensive.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What do you mean, you won't go out with me? You must be getting it from someone else."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And, "I may be short, honey, but not everywhere. You know what I mean?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She came to dread the occasions she had to work with him. Time after time, Paige watched Kane perform unnecessary surgery and take out organs that were healthy.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One day, as Paige and Kane were walking toward the operating room, Paige asked, "What are we going to operate on, doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "His wallet!" He saw the look on Paige's face. "Just kidding, honey."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He should be working in a butcher shop," Paige later said angrily to Kat. "He has no right to be op\-erating on people."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 After a particularly inept liver operation, Dr. Kane turned to Paige and shook his head. "Too bad. I don't know if he's going to make it."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was all Paige could do to contain her anger. She decided to have a talk with Tom Chang.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Someone should report Dr. Kane," Paige said. "He's murdering his patients!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Take it easy."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I can't! It's not right that they let a man like that operate. It's criminal. He should be brought up before the credentials committee."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What good would it do? You'd have to get other doctors to testify against him
, and no one would be willing to do that. This is a close community, and we all have to live in it, Paige. It's almost impossible to get one doctor to testify against another. We're all vul\-
nerable and we need each other too much. Calm down. I'll take you out and buy you lunch."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sighed. "All right, but it's a lousy system."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At lunch, Paige asked, "How are you and Sye do\-ing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He took a moment to answer. "I . . . we're having problems. My work is destroying our marriage. I don't know what to do."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sure it will work out," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang said fiercely, "It had better."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked up at him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I would kill myself if she left me."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following morning, Arthur Kane was scheduled to perform a kidney operation. The chief of surgery said to Paige, "Dr. Kane asked for you to assist him in OR Four."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's mouth was suddenly dry. She hated the thought of being near him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said,' 'Couldn't you get someone else to . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's waiting for you, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sighed. "Right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 By the time Paige had scrubbed up, the operation was already in progress.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Give me a hand here, darling," Kane said to Paige.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The patient's abdomen had been painted with an io\-dine solution and an incision had been made in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, just below the rib cage. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 So far, so good, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Scalpel!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The scrub nurse handed Dr. Kane a scalpel.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked up. "Put some music on."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A moment later a CD began to play.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Kane kept cutting. "Let's have something a little peppier." He looked over at Paige. "Start the bovie, sweetheart."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Sweetheart. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige gritted her teeth and picked up a bovie\emdash an electric cautery tool. She began to cauterize the arteries to reduce the amount of blood in the abdo\-
men. The operation was going well.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Thank God, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought.
\par "Sponge."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The scrub nurse handed Kane a sponge.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good. Let's have some suction." He cut around the kidney until it was exposed. "There's the little devil," Dr. Kane said. "More suction." He lifted up the kidney with forceps. "Right. Let's sew him back up."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 For once, everything had gone well, yet something was bothering Paige. She took a closer look at the kid\-ney. It looked healthy. She frowned, wondering if ...}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Dr. Kane began sewing up the patient, Paige hur\-ried over to the X-ray in the lighted wall frame. She studied it for a moment and said softly, "Oh, my God!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The X-ray had been put up backward. Dr. Kane had removed the wrong kidney.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Thirty minutes later, Paige was in Ben Wallace's office.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He took out a healthy kidney and left in a diseased one!" Paige's voice was trembling. "The man should be put in jail!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Benjamin Wallace said soothingly, "Paige, I agree with you that it's regrettable. But it certainly wasn't intentional. It was a mistake, and\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 mistake'? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That patient is going to have to live on dial\-ysis for the rest of his life. Someone should pay for that!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Believe me, we're going to have a peer review evaluation."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige knew what that meant: a group of physicians would review what had happened, but it would be done in confidence. The information would be withheld from the public and the patient.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Wallace ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're part of our team, Paige. You've got to be a team player.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He has no business working in this hospital. Or any other hospital."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You've got to look at the whole picture. If he were removed, there would be bad publicity and the reputa\-tion of the hospital would be hurt. We'd probably face a lot of malpractice suits."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What about the patients?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll keep a closer eye on Dr. Kane." He l
eaned forward in his chair. "I'm going to give you some advice. When you get into private practice, you're going j to need the goodwill of other doctors for referrals. With-1 out that, you'll go nowhere, and if you get the reputation! of being a maverick 
and blowing the whistle on your: fellow doctors, you won't get any referrals. I can prom\-ise you that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige rose. "So you aren't going to do anything?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I told you, we're going to do a peer review evalua\-tion."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And that's it?" "That's it."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's not fair," Paige said. She was in the cafeteria having lunch with Kat and Honey.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat shook her head. "Nobody said life has to be fair."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked around the antiseptic white-tiled room. "This whole place depresses me. Everybody is sick."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Or they wouldn't be here," Kat pointed out.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why don't we give a party?" Honey suggested.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A party? What are you talking about?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey's voice was suddenly filled with enthusiasm. "We could order up some decent food and liquor, and have a celebration! I think we could all use a little cheering up."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought for a second. "You know," she said, "that's not a bad idea. Let's do it!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a deal. I'll organize things," Honey told them. "We'll do it tomorrow after rounds."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Arthur Kane approached Paige in the corridor. There was ice in his voice. "You've been a naughty girl. Someone should teach you to keep your mouth shut!" And he walked away.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked after him in disbelief. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Wallace told him what I said. He shouldn't have done that. 'If you get the reputation of being a maverick and blowing the whistle on your fellow doctors . . .' Would Ido it again? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige pondered. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Darned right I would!}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
News of the forthcoming party spread rapidly. All the residents chipped in. A lavish menu was ordered from Ernie's, and liquor was delivered from a nearby store. The party was set for five o'clock in the doctors' lounge. The food and drinks 
arrived at four-thirty. There was a feast: seafood platters with lobster and shrimp, a variety of pates, Swedish meatballs, hot pasta, fruit, and desserts. When Paige, Kat, and Honey walked into the lounge at five-fifteen, it was already crowded with eage
r residents, interns, and nurses, eating and having a wonderful time.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige turned to Honey. "This was a great idea!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey smiled. "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 An announcement came over the loudspeaker. "Dr. Finley and Dr. Ketler to the ER. Stat." And the two doctors, in the middle of downing shrimp, looked at each other, sighed, and hurriedly left the room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Tom Chang came up to Paige. "We ought to do this every week," he said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right. It's\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The loudspeaker came on again. "Dr. Chang . . . Room 7. ... Dr. Chang . . . Room 7."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And a minute later, "Dr. Smythe . . . ER Two. . . . Dr. Smythe to ER Two."
\par The loudspeaker never stopped. Within thirty min\-utes, almost every doctor and nurse had been called away on some emergency. Honey heard her name called, and then Paige's, and Kat's.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I can't believe what's happening," Kat said. "You know how people talk about having a guardian angel?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Well, I think the three of us are under the spell of a guardian devil." Her words proved to be prophetic.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next Monday morning, when Paige got off duty and went to get into her car, two of the tires had been slashed. She stared at them in disbelief. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Someone should teach you to keep your mouth shut!

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When she got back to the apartment she said to Kat and Honey, "Watch out for Arthur Kane. He's crazy."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat had forgotten the incident with Dinetto, but now it suddenly flashed into her mind: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lady, you don't know who you're talking to. You better do what the man says. This is Mr. Lou Dinetto.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following night, when Kat left the hospital, a black limousine was waiting for her at the curb. The Shadow and Rhino were standing beside it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Kat started to pass, Rhino said, "Get in, doctor. Mr. Dinetto wants to see you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She studied the man for a moment. Rhino was omi\-nous-looking, but it was the Shadow who frightened Kat. There was something deadly about his stillness. Under other circumstances, Kat would never have got\-
ten into the car, but Mike's telephone call had puzzled her. And worried her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was driven to a small apartment on the outskirts of the city, and when she arrived, Dinetto was waiting for her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 What am I letting myself in for? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat wondered. "Very well."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

By the beginning of her fourth year of residency, Paige had assisted in hundreds of operations. They had become second nature to her. She knew the surgery procedures for the gallbladder, spleen, liver, appendix, and, most exciting, the he
art. But Paige was frustrated because she was not doing the operations her\-self. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Whatever happened to "Watch one, do one, teach one"? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she wondered.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The answer came when George Englund, chief of surgery, sent for her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paige, there's a hernia operation scheduled for to\-morrow in OR Three, seven-thirty }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a.m."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She made a note. "Right. Who's doing the opera\-tion?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You are."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right. I ..." The words suddenly sank in. "}{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  am?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. Any problem with that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's grin lit up the room. "No, sir! I... thanks!" "You're ready for it. I think the patient's lucky to have you. His name is Walter Herzog. He's in 314." "Herzog. Room 314. Right." And Paige was out the door.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige had never been so excited. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to do my first ope
ration! I'm going to hold a human being's life in my hands. What if I'm not ready"? What if I make a mistakel Things can go wrong. It's Murphy's Law. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
By the time Paige was through arguing with herself, she was in a state of panic.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She went into the cafeteria and sat down to have a cup of black coffee. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It's going to be all right, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she told herself. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
I've assisted in dozens of hernia operations. There's nothing to it. He's lucky to have me. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 By the time she finished her coffee, she was calm enough to face her first patient.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Walter Herzog was in his sixties, thin, bald, and very nervous. He was in bed, clutching his groin, when Paige walked in, carrying a bouquet of flowers. Herzog looked up.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Nurse ... I want to see a doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige walked over to the bed and handed him the flowers. "I'm the doctor. I'm going to operate on you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at the flowers, and looked at her. "You're }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 what?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't worry," Paige said reassuringly. "You're in good hands." She picked up his chart at the foot of the bed and studied it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What does it say?" the man asked anxiously. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Why did she bring me flowers'?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It says you're going to be just fine."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He swallowed. "Are you really going to do the opera\-tion?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You seem awfully . . . awfully young."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige patted his arm. "I haven't lost a patient yet." She looked around the room. "Are you comfortable? Can I get you anything to read? A book or magazine? Candy?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was listening, nervously. "No, I'm okay." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Why was she being so nice to him? Was there something she wasn't telling him?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, then, I'll see you in the morning," Paige said cheerfully. She wrote something on a piece of paper and handed it to him. "Here's my home number. You call me if you need me tonight. I'll stay right by the phone."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 By the time Paige left, Walter Herzog was a nervous wreck.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A few }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 minutes later, jimmy found Paige in the lounge. He walked up to her with his wide grin. "Con\-gratulations! I hear you're going to do a procedure."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Word gets around fast, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Whoever he is, he's lucky," Jimmy said. "If any\-thing ever happened to me, you're the only one I'd let operate on me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks, Jimmy."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And, of course, with Jimmy, there was always a joke.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did you hear the one about the man who had a strange pain in his ank
les? He was too cheap to go to a doctor, so when his friend told him he had exactly the same pain, he said, 'You'd better get to a doctor right away. And tell me exactly what he says.'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The next day, he learns his friend is dead. He rushes to a hospital an
d has five thousand dollars' worth of tests. They can't find anything wrong. He calls his friend's widow, and says, 'Was Chester in a lot of pain before he died?' " 'No,' she says. 'He didn't even see the truck that hit him!' " And Jimmy was gone.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was too excited to eat dinner. She spent the evening practicing tying surgical knots on table legs and lamps. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to get a good night's sleep, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige decided, }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 so I'll}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 be nice and fresh in the morning.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was awake all night, going over the operation again and again in her mind.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There are three types of hernias: reducible hernia, where it's possible to push the testicles back into the abdomen; }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 irreducible }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
hernia, where adhesions prevent returning the contents to the abdomen; and the most dangerous, strangulated hernia, where the blood flow through the hernia is shut off, damaging the intestines. Walter Herzog's was a reducible hernia.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At six o'clock in the morning, Paige drove to the hospital parking lot. A new red Ferrari was next to her parking space. Idly, Paige wondered who owned it. Whoever it was had to be rich.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At seven o'clock, Paige was helping Walter Herzog change from pajamas to a blue hospital gown. The nurse had already given him a sedative to relax him while they waited for the gurney that would take him to the operating room.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This is my first operation," Walter Herzog said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mine, too, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The gurney arrived and Walter Herzog was on his way to OR Three. Paige walked down the corridor be\-side him, and her heart was pounding so loudly that she was afraid he could hear it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 OR Three was one of the larger operating rooms, able to accommodate a heart monitor, a heart-lung ma\-chine, and 
an array of other technical paraphernalia. When Paige walked into the room, the staff were already there, preparing the equipment. There was an attending physician, the anesthesiologist, two residents, a scrub nurse, and two circulating nurses.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The staff were watching her expectantly, eager to see how she would handle her first operation.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige walked up to the operating table. Walter Herzog had had his groin shaved and scrubbed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes had been placed around the op\-erating area.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Herzog looked up at Paige and said drowsily, "You're not going to let me die, are you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige smiled. "What? And spoil my perfect rec\-ord?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She looked over at the anesthesiologist, who would give the patient an epidural anesthesia, a saddle block. Paige took a deep breath and nodded. The operation began.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Scalpel."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Paige was about to make the first cut through the skin, the circulating nurse said something.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Would you like some music, doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was the first time she had been asked that question. Paige smiled. "Right. Let's have some Jimmy Buffet."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The moment Paige made the first incision, her ner\-vousness vanished. It was as though she had done this all her life. Skillfully, she cut through the first layers of fat and muscle, to the 
site of the hernia. All the while, she was aware of the familiar litany that was echoing through the room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sponge. . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Give me a bovie. ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There it is. . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Looks like we got there just in time. ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Clamp. ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Suction, please. ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's mind was totally focused on what she was}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 doing. Locate the hernial sac ... free it ... place the}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 contents back into the abdominal cavity ... tie off the}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 base of the sac ... cut off the remainder . . . inguinal ...ring . . . suture it ...}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
\par One hour and twenty minutes after the first incision, the operation was finished.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige should have felt drained, but instead she felt wildly exhilarated.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Walter Herzog had been sewn up, the scrub nurse turned to Paige. "Dr. Taylor ..." Paige looked up. "Yes?" The nurse grinned. "That was beautiful, doctor."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was Sunday and the three women had the day off.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What should we do today?" Kat asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige had an idea. "It's such a lovely day, why don't we drive out to Tree Park? We can pack a picnic lunch and eat outdoors."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That sounds lovely," Honey said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The telephone rang. The three of them stared at it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Jesus!" Kat said. "I thought Lincoln freed us. Don't answer it. It's our day off."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 have }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 no days off," Paige reminded her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat walked over to the telephone and picked it up. "Dr. Hunter." She listened for a moment and handed the telephone to Paige. "It's for you, Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said resignedly, "Right." She picked up the receiver. "Dr. Taylor. . . . Hello, Tom. . . . What? . . . No, I was just going out. ... I see. ... All right. I'll be there in fifteen minutes." She replaced the re\-ceiver. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 So much for the picnic, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

Twenty minutes later, Paige was walking into the visitors' waiting room. A man in a dark suit was seated in a chair, staring out the window. "Mr. Newton?" He rose to his feet. "Yes."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm Dr. Taylor. I was just in to see your little boy. He was brought i

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mr. Newton shook his head. "We are Jehovah's Wit\-nesses. The Lord will not let him die, and I will not let him be tainted with someone else's blood. It was my wife who brought him here. She will be punished for that."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mr. Newton, I don't think you understand how seri\-ous the situation is. If we don't operate right away, your son is going to die."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The man looked at her and smiled. "You don't know God's ways, do you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was angry. "I may not know a lot about God's ways, but I do know a lot about a ruptured spleen." She took out a piece of paper. "He's a minor, so you'll have to sign this consent form for him." She held it out.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And if I don't sign it?" "Why . . . then we can't operate." He nodded. "Do you think your powers are stronger than the Lord's?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was staring at him. "You're not going to sign, are you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. A higher power than yours will help my son, You will see."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige returned to the ward, six-year-old Peter Newton had lapsed into unconsciousness.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's not going to make it," Chang said. "He's lost too much blood. What do you want to do?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige made her decision. "Get him into OR One. Stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang looked at her in surprise. "His father changed his mind?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good for you! I talked to him for an hour and I couldn't budge him. He said God would take care of it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "God is taking care of it," Paige assured him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Two hours and four pints of blood later, the operation was successfully completed. All the boy's vital signs were strong.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Benjamin Wallace was so angry his voice was crack\-ing. "How could you do such an outrageous thing? You gave him a blood transfusion and operated without permission? You broke the law!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 All hospitals have problems with drug theft. By law, each narcotic that is taken from the dispen\-sary must be signed for, but no matter how con\-
trolled the security is, drug addicts almost invariably find a way to circumvent it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Embarcadero County Hospital was having a major problem. Margaret Spencer went to see Ben Wallace. "I don't know what to do, doctor. Our fentanyl keeps disappearing."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Fentanyl is a highly addictive narcotic and anesthetic drug.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How much is missing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A great deal. If it were just a few bottles, there could be an innocent explanation for it, but it's happening now on a regular basis. More than a dozen bottles a week are disappearing.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you have any idea who might be taking it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, sir. I've talked to security. They're at a loss.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Who has access to the dispensary?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's the problem. Most of the anesthetists have pretty free access to it, and most of the nurses and surgeons."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace was thoughtful. "Thank you for coming to me. I'll take care of it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you, doctor." Nurse Spencer left.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I don't need this right now, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Wallace thought angrily. A hospital board meeting was coming up, and there were already enough problems to be dealt with. Ben Wallace was well aware of the statistics. More than 10
 percent of the doctors in the United States became addicted, at one time or another, to either drugs or alcohol. The easy accessibility of the drugs made them a temptation. It was simple for a doctor to open a cabi\-
net, take out the drug he wanted, and use a tourniquet and syringe to inject it. An addict could need a fix as often as every two hours.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Now it was happening at his hospital. Something had to be done about it before the board meeting. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It would look bad on my record.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ben Wallace was not sure whom he could trust to help him find the culprit. He had to be careful. He was certain that neither Dr. Taylor nor Dr. Hunter was involved, and after a great deal of thought, he decided to use them.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He sent for the two of them. "I have a favor to ask of you
," he told them. He explained about the missing fentanyl. "I want you to keep your eyes open. If any of the doctors you work with have to step out of the OR for a moment, in the middle of an operation, or show any other signs of addiction, I want you to l
et me know. Look for any changes in personality\emdash depression or mood swings\emdash or tardiness, or missed appointments. I would appreciate it if you would keep this strictly confidential.''
\par When they left the office, Kat said, "This is a big hospital. We're going to need Sherlock Holmes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, we won't," Paige said unhappily. "I know who it is."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mitch Campbell was one of Paige's favorite doctors. Dr. Campbell was a likable gray-haired man in his fif\-ties, always good-humored, and one of the hospital's best surgeons. Paige had noticed lately that he was al\-
ways a few minutes late for an operation, and that he had developed a noticeable tremor. He used Paige to assist him as often as possible, and he usually let her do a major part of the surgery. In the middle of an 
operation, his hands would begin to shake and he would hand the scalpel to Paige.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm not feeling well," he would mumble. "Would you take over?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And he would leave the operating room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige had been concerned about what could be wrong with him. Now she k
new. She debated what to do. She was aware that if she brought her information to Wallace, Dr. Campbell would be fired, or worse, his career would be destroyed. On the other hand, if she did nothing, she would be putting patients' lives in danger. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Perhaps I could talk to him, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Tell him what I know, and insist that he get treatment. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She discussed it with Kat.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a problem," Kat agreed. "He's a nice guy, and a good doctor. If you blow the whistle, he's finished, but if you don't, you have to think about the harm he might do. What do you think will happen if you confront him?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He'll probably deny it, Kat. That's the usual pat\-tern."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yeah. It's a tough call."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following day, Paige had an operation scheduled with Dr. Campbell. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 hope I'm wrong, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige prayed. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Don't let him be late, and don't let him leave during the operation.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Campbell was fifteen minutes late, and in the middle of the operation, he said, "Take over, will you, Paige? I'll be right back."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I must talk to him, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige decided. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I can't destroy his career.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following morning, as Paige and Honey drove into the doctors' parking lot, Harry Bowman pulled up next to them in the red Ferrari.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's a beautiful car," Honey said. "How much does one of those cost?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bowman laughed. "If you have to ask, you can't afford it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 But Paige wasn't listening. She was staring at the car, and thinking about the penthouse, the lavish parties, and the boat. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
was smart enough to have a clever father. He left all his money to me. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And yet Bowman worked at a county hospital. Why?
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ten minutes later, Paige was in the personnel office, talking to Karen, the secretary in charge of records.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do me a favor, will you, Karen? Just between us,  Harry Bowman has asked me to go out with him and I have a feeling he's married. Would you let me have a peek at his personnel file?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sure. Those horny bastards. They never get enough, do they? You're darn right I'll let you look at his file." She went over to a cabinet and found what she was looking for. She brought some papers back to Paige.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige glanced through them quickly. Dr. Harry Bow\-man's application showed that he had come from
 a small university in the Midwest and, according to the records, had worked his way through medical school. He was an anesthesiologist.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 His father was a barber.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey Taft was an enigma to most of the doctors at Embarcadero County Hospital. During the m
orning rounds, she appeared to be unsure of herself. But on the afternoon rounds, she seemed like a different person. She was surprisingly knowledgeable about each patient, and crisp and efficient in her diagnoses.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of the senior residents was discussing her with a colleague.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll be damned if I understand it," he said. "In the morning, the complaints about Dr. Taft keep piling up. She keeps making mistakes. You know the joke about the nurse who gets everything wrong? A doctor is com\-
plaining that he t
old her to give the patient in Room 4 three pills, and she gave the patient in Room 3 four pills, and just as he's talking about her, he sees her chasing a naked patient down the hall, holding a pan of boiling water. The doctor says, 'Look at that! I told
 her to prick his boil!' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 His colleague laughed.
\par "Well, that's Dr. Taft. But in the afternoon she's absolutely brilliant. Her diagnoses are correct, her notes are wonde
rful, and she's as sharp as hell. She must be taking some kind of miracle pill that only works afternoons." He scratched his head. "It beats the hell out of me."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Nathan Ritter was a pedant, a man who lived and worked by the book. While he lacked the spark of brilliance, he was capable and dedicated, and he ex\-pected the same qualities from those who worked with him.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey had the misfortune to be assigned to his team.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Their first stop was a ward containing a dozen pa\-tients. One of them was just finishing breakfast. Ritter looked at the chart at the foot of the bed. "Dr. Taft, the chart says this is your patient."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey nodded. "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's having a bronchoscopy this morning."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey nodded. "That's right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And you're allowing him to }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 eat?" }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Ritter snapped. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Before }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a bronchoscopy?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey said, '"'The poor man hasn't had anything to eat since\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Nathan Ritter turned to his assistant. "Postpone the procedure." He started to say something to Honey, then controlled himself. "Let's move on."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next patient was  a Puerto Rican who was coughing badly. Dr. Ritter examined him. "Whose pa\-tient is this?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mine," Honey said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He frowned. "His infection should have cleared up before now." He took a look at the chart. "You're giving him fifty milligrams of ampicillin four times a day?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 not }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 right. It's }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 wrong. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That's supposed to be }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 five hundred }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 milligrams four times a day. You left off a zero."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry, I ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No wonder the patient's not getting any better! I want it changed immediately."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, doctor."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they came to another patient of Honey's, Dr. Ritter said impatiently, "He's scheduled for a colonoscopy. Where is the radiology report?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The radiology report? Oh. I'm afraid I forgot to order one."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ritter gave Honey a long, speculative look.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The morning went downhill from there.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next patient they saw was moaning tearfully. "I'm in such pain. What's wrong with me?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We don't know," Honey said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Ritter glared at her. "Dr. Taft, may I see you outside for a moment?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the corridor, he said, "Never, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 never }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
tell a patient that you don't know. You're the one they're looking to for help! And if you don't know the answer, make one up. Do you understand?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It doesn't seem right to . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I didn't ask you whether it seemed right. Just do as you're told."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They examined a hiatal hernia, a hepatitis patient, a patient with Alzheimer's disease, and two dozen others. The minute the rounds were over, Dr. Ritter went to Benjamin Wallace's office.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We have a problem," Ritter said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What is it, Nathan?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's one of the residents here. Honey Taft."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Again? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What about her?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She's a disaster."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But she had such a wonderful recommendation."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ben, you'd better get rid of her before the hospital gets in real trouble, before she kills a patient or two."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace thought about it for a moment, then made his decision. "Right. She'll be out of here."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was busy in surgery most of the morning. As soon as she was free, she went to see Dr. Wallace, to tell him of her suspicions about Harry Bowman.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Bowman? Are you sure? I mean . . . I've seen no signs of any addiction."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He doesn't use it," Paige explained. "He sells it. He's living like a millionaire on a resident's salary."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ben Wallace nodded. "Very well. I'll check it out. Thank you, Paige."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace sent for Bruce Anderson, head of security. "We may have identified the drug thief," Wallace told him. "I want you to keep a close watch on Dr. Harry Bowman."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Bowman?" Anderson tried to conceal his surprise. Dr. Bowman was constantly giving the guards Cuban cigars and other little gifts. They all loved him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "If he goes into the dispensary, search him when he comes out."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, sir."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Harry Bowman was headed for the dispensary. He had orders to fill. A }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 lot }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
of orders. It had started as a lucky accident. He had been working in a small hospital in Ames, Iowa, struggling to get by on a resident's salary. He had champagne taste and a beer pocketbook, and then Fate had smiled on him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of his patients who had been discharged from the hospital telephoned him one morning.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Doctor, I'm in terrible pain. You have to give me something for it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you want to check back in?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't want to leave the house. Couldn't you bring something here for me?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bowman thought about it. "All right. I'll drop by on my way home."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When he visited the patient, he brought with him a bottle of fentanyl.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The patient grabbed it. "That's wonderful!" he said. He pulled out a handful of bills. "Here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bowman looked at him, surprised. "You don't have to pay me for that.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you kidding? This stuff is like gold. I have a lot of friends who will pay you a fortune if you bring them this stuff."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That was how it had begun
. Within two months, Harry Bowman was making more money than he had ever dreamed possible. Unfortunately, the head of the hospital got wind of what was going on. Fearing a public scandal, he told Bowman that if he left quietly, nothing would appear on his
 record.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm glad I left, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bowman thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 San Francisco has a much bigger market.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He reached the dispensary. Bruce Anderson was standing outside. Bowman nodded to him. "Hi, Bruce."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good afternoon, Dr. Bowman."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Five minutes later when Bowman came out of the dispensary, Anderson said, "Excuse me. I'm going to have to search you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Harry Bowman stared at him. "Search me? What are you talking about, Bruce?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry, doctor. We have orders to search every\-one who uses the dispensary," Anderson lied.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bowman was indignant. "I've never heard of such a thing. I absolutely refuse!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Then I'll have to ask you to come along with me to Dr. Wallace's office."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fine! He's going to be furious when he hears about this."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bowman stormed into Wallace's office. "What's go\-ing on, Ben? This man wanted to search me, for God's sake!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And did you refuse to be searched?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Absolutely."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right." Wallace reached for the telephone. "I'll let the San Francisco police do it, if you prefer." He began to dial.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bowman panicked. "Wait a minute! That's not nec\-
essary." His face suddenly cleared. "Oh! I know what this is all about!" He reached in his pocket and took out a bottle of fentanyl. "I was taking these to use for an operation, and ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace said quietly, "Empty your pockets."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A look of desperation came over Bowman's face. "There's no reason to . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Empty your pockets."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Two hours later, the San Francisco office of the Drug Enforcement Agency had a signed confession and the names of the people to whom Bowman had been selling drugs.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige heard the news, she went to see Mitch Campbell. He was sitting in an office, resting. His hands were on the desk when Paige walked in, and she could see the tremor in them.
\par Campbell quickly moved his hands to his lap. "Hello, Paige. How're you doing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fine, Mitch. I wanted to talk to you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sit down."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She took a seat opposite him. "How long have you had Parkinson's?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He turned a shade whiter. "What?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's it, isn't it? You've been trying to cover it up."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a heavy silence. "I . . . I . . . yes. But I ... I can't give up being a doctor. I ... I just can't give it up. It's my whole life."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige leaned forward and said earnestly, "You don't have to give up being a doctor, but you shouldn't be operating."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked suddenly old. "I know. I was going to quit last year." He smiled wanly. "I guess I'll have to quit now, won't I? You're going to tell Dr. Wallace."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No," Paige said gently. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 going to tell Dr. Wallace."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was having lunch in the cafeteria when Tom Chang joined her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I heard what happened," he said. "Bowman! Unbe\-lievable. Nice work."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She shook her head. "I almost had the wrong man."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chang sat there, silent.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you all right, Tom?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you want the 'I'm fine,' or do you want the truth?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're friends. I want the truth."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "My marriage has gone to hell." His eyes suddenly filled with tears. "Sye has left. She's gone back home."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm so sorry."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's not her fault. We didn't have a marriage any\-more. She said I'm married to the hospital, and she's right. I'm spending my whole life here, taking care of strangers, instead of being with the people I love."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She'll come back. It will work out," Paige said soothingly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. Not this time."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Have you thought about counseling, or . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She refuses."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry, Tom. If there's anything I ..." She heard her name on the loudspeaker.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor, Room 410 ..."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige felt a sudden pang of alarm. "I have to go," she said. Room 410. That was Sam Bernstein's
 room. He was one of her favorite patients, a gentle man in his seventies who had been brought in with inoperable stomach cancer. Many of the patients at the hospital were constantly complaining, but Sam Bernstein was an exception. Paige admired his coura
ge and his dignity. He had a wife and two grown sons who visited him regularly, and Paige had grown fond of them, too.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He had been put on life-support systems with a note, DNR\emdash Do Not Resuscitate\emdash if his heart stopped.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige walked into his room, a nurse was at the bedside. She looked up as Paige entered. "He's gone, doctor. I didn't start emergency procedures, because ..." Her voice trailed off.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You were right not to," Paige said slowly. "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Is there anything I . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. I'll make the arra
ngements." Paige stood by the bedside and looked down at the body of what had been a living, laughing human being, a man who had a family and friends, someone who had spent his life working hard, taking care of the ones he loved. And now . . .
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She walked over to the drawer where he kept his possessions. There was an inexpensive watch, a set of keys, fifteen dollars in cash, dentures, and a letter to his wife. All that remained of a man's life.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
\par Paige was unable to shake the feeling of depression that hung over her. "He was such a dear man. Why . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat said, "Paige, you can't let yourself get emotion\-ally involved with your patients. It will tear you apart."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know. You're right, Kat. It's just that . . . it's over so quickly, isn't it? This morning he and I were talking. Tomorrow is his funeral."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're not thinking of going to it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The funeral took place at the Hills of Eternity Ceme\-tery.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the Jewish religion, burial must take place as soon as possible following the death, and the service usually takes place the next day.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The body of Sam Bernstein was dressed in a }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 takhrik-him, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a white robe, and wrapped in a }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 talit. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
The family was gathered around the graveside. The rabbi was inton\-ing, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hamakom y'nathaim etkhem b'tokh sh'ar availai tziyon veeyerushalayim.''
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A man standing next to Paige saw the puzzled expres\-sion on her face, and he translated for her. " 'May the Lord comfort you with all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.' "
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 To Paige's astonishment, the members of the family began tearing at the clothes they were wearing as they chanted, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Baruch ata adonai elohainu me lech haolam dayan ha-emet."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's  to  show  respect,"   the  man  whispered.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "From dust you are and to dust you have returned, but the spirit returns to God who gave it." The ceremony was over.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following morning, Kat ran into Honey in the corridor. Honey looked nervous.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Anything wrong?" Kat asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Wallace sent for me. He asked me to be in his office at two o'clock."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you know why?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I think I messed up at rounds the other day. Dr. Ritter is a monster."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He can be," Kat said. "But I'm sure everything will be all right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I hope so. I just have a bad feeling."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Promptly at two o'clock, she arrived at Benjamin Wallace's office, carrying a small jar of honey in her purse. The receptionist was at lunch. Dr. Wallace's door was open. "Come in, Dr. Taft," he called.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey walked into his office.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Close the door behind you, please."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey closed the door.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Take a seat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey sat down across from him. She was almost trembling.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Benjamin Wallace looked across at her and thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It's like kicking a puppy. But what has to be done has to be done. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
"I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news for you," he said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One hour later, Honey met Kat in the solarium. Honey sank into a chair next to her, smiling.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did you see Dr. Wallace?" Kat asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
"Oh, yes. We had a long talk. Did you know that his wife left him last September? They were married for fifteen years. He has two grown children from an earlier marriage, but he hardly ever sees them. The poor darling is so lonely."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

pital. It seemed to them that nothing in their lives had changed except the names of their patients.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Paige walked through the parking lot, she was reminded of Harry Bowman and his red Ferrari. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 How many lives were destroyed by the poison Harry Bowman was selling"? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
she wondered. Drugs were so seductive. And, in the end, so deadly.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jimmy Ford showed up with a small bouquet of flow\-ers for Paige.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's this for, Jimmy?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He blushed. "I just wanted you to have it. Did you know I'm getting married?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No! That's wonderful. Who's the lucky girl?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Her name is Betsy. She works at a dress shop.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 We're going to have half a dozen kids. The first girl is going to be named Paige. I hope you don't mind."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mind? I'm flattered."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was embarrassed. "Did you hear the one about the doctor who gave a patient two weeks to live? 'I can't pay you right now,' the man said. 'All right, I'll give you another two weeks.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And Jimmy was gone.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was worried about Tom Chang. He was having violent mood swings from euphoria to deep depression.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One morning during a talk with Paige, he said, "Do you realize that most of the people in here would die without us? We have the power to heal their bodies and make them whole again."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And the next morning: "We're all kidding ourselves, Paige. Our patients would get better faster without us. We're hypocrites, pretending that we have all the an\-swers. Well, we don't."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige studied him a moment. "What do you hear from Sye?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I talked to her yesterday. She won't come back here. She's going ahead with the divorce."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige put her hand on his arm. "I'm so sorry, Tom."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He shrugged. "Why? It doesn't bother me. Not any\-more. I'll find another woman." He grinned. "And have another child. You'll see."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was something unreal about the conversation.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That night Paige said to Kat, "I'm worried about Tom Chang. Have you talked to him lately?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did he seem normal to you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No man seems normal to me," Kat said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was still concerned. "Let's invite him for din\-ner tomorrow night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next morning when Paige reported to the hospi\-tal, she was greeted with the news that a janitor had found Tom Chang's body in a basement equipment room. He had died of an overdose of sleeping pills.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was near hysteria. "I could have saved him," she cried. "All this time he was calling out for help, and I didn't hear him."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat said firmly, "There's no way you could have helped him, Paige. You were not the problem, and you were not the solution. He didn't want to live without his wife and child. It's as simple as that."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige wiped the tears from her eyes. "Damn this place!" she said. "If it weren't for the pressure and the hours, his wife never would have left him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But she did," Kat said gently. "It's over."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige had never been to a Chinese funeral before. It was an incredible spectacle. It began at the Green Street Mortuary in Chinatown early in the morning, where a crowd started gathering outside. A parade was assem\-
bled, with a large brass marching band, and at the head of the parade, mourners carried a huge blowup of a photograph of Tom Chang.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The march began with the band loudly playing, wind\-ing through the streets of San Francisco, with a hearse at the end of the procession. Most of the mourners were on foot, but the more elderly rode in cars.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 To Paige, the parade seemed to be moving around the city at random. She was puzzled. "Where are they going?" she asked one of the mourners.
\par He bowed slightly and said, "It is our custom to take the departed past some of the places that have meaning in his life\emdash restaurants where he ate, shops that he used, places he visited ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I see."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The parade ended in front of Embarcadero County Hospital.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The mourner turned to Paige and said,' 'This is where Tom Chang worked. This is where he found his happi\-ness."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wrong, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This is where he lost his happi\-ness.

Walking down Market Street one morning, Paige saw Alfred Turner. Her heart started pounding. She had not been able to get him out of her mind. He was starting to cross the street as the light was changing. When Paige got to the corner, th
e light had turned to red. She ignored it and ran out into the street, oblivious to the honking horns and the outraged cries of motorists.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige reached the other side and hurried to catch up with him. She grabbed his sleeve. "Alfred ..."
\par The man turned. "I beg your pardon?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was a total stranger.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Now that Paige and Kat were fourth-year residents, they were performing operations on a regular basis.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was working with doctors in neurosurgery, and she never ceased to be amazed at the miracle of the hundred billion complex digital computers called neu\-rons that lived in the skull. The work was exciting.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat had enormous respect for most of the doctors she worked with. They were brilliant, skilled surgeons. There were a few doctors who g
ave her a hard time. They tried to date her, and the more Kat refused to go out with them, the more of a challenge she became.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She heard one doctor mutter, "Here comes old iron-pants."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was assisting Dr. Kibler at a brain operation. A tiny incision was
 made in the cortex, and Dr. Kibler pushed the rubber cannula into the left lateral ventricle, the cavity in the center of the left half of the brain, while Kat held the incision open with a small retractor. Her entire concentration was focused on what wa
s hap\-pening in front of her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Kibler glanced at her and, as he worked, said, "Did you hear about the wino who staggered into a bar and said, 'Give me a drink, quick!' 'I can't do that,' the bartender said. 'You're already drunk.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The burr was cutting in deeper.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 " 'If you don't give me a drink, I'll kill myself.' "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Cerebral spinal fluid flowed out of the cannula from the ventricle.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll tell you what I'll do,' the bartender said. 'There are three things I want. You do them for me, and I'll give you a bottle. "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As he went on talking, fifteen milliliters of air were injected into the ventricle, and X-rays were taken of the anterior-posterior view and the lateral view.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 " 'See that football player sitting in the corner? I can't get him out of here. I want
 you to throw him out. Next, I have a pet crocodile in my office with a bad tooth. He's so mean I can't get a vet to go near him. Lastly, there's a lady doctor from the Department of Health who's trying to close up this place. You fuck her, and you get th
e bottle.' "
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A scrub nurse was using suction to reduce the amount of blood in the field.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The wino throws out the football player, and goes into the office where the crocodile is. He comes out fifteen minutes later, all bloody, and his clothes torn, and he says, "Where's the lady doctor with the bad tooth? "}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Kibler roared with laughter. "Do you get it? He fucked the crocodile instead of the doctor. It was proba\-bly a better experience!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat stood there, furious, wanting to slap him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When the operation was over, Kat went to the on-call room to try to get over her anger. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm not going to let the bastards beat me down. I'm not.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 From time to time, Paige went out with doctors from the hospital, but she refused to get romantically involved with any of them. Alfred Turner had hurt her too deeply, and she was determined never to go through that again.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Most of her days and nights were spent at the hospital. The schedule was grueling, but Paige was doing general surgery and she enjoyed it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One morning, George Englund, the chief of surgery, sent for her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're starting your specialty this year. Cardiovas\-cular surgery."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She nodded. "That's right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, I have a treat for you. Have you heard of Dr. Barker?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at him in surprise. "Dr. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lawrence }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Barker?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Of course."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Everyone had heard of Lawrence Barker. He was one of the most famous cardiovascular surgeons in the world.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, he returned last week from Saudi Arabia, where he operated on the king. Dr. Barker's an old friend of mine, and he's agreed to give us three days a Week here. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Pro bono."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's fantastic!" Paige exclaimed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm putting you on his team."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 For a moment, Paige was speechless. "I . . .I don't know what to say. I'm very grateful."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a wonderful opportunity for you. You can learn a lot from him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sure I can. Thank you, George. I really appreci\-ate this."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You'll start your rounds with him tomorrow morn\-ing at six o'clock."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm looking forward to it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Looking forward to it" was an understatement. It had been Paige's dream to work with someone like Dr. Lawrence Barker. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
What do I mean, "someone like Dr. Lawrence Barker"? There's only one Dr. Lawrence Barker.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She had never seen a photograph of him, but she could visualize what he looked like. He would be tall and handsome, with silver-gray hair, and slender, sensi\-tive hands. A warm and gentle man. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
We'll be working closely together, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 and I'm going to make myself absolutely indispensable. I wonder if he's mar\-ried?
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That night, Paige had an erotic dream about Dr. Barker. They were performing an operation in the nude. In the middle of it, Dr. Barker said, "I want you." A nurse moved the patient off t
he operating table and Dr. Barker picked Paige up and put her on the table, and made love to her.
\par When Paige woke up, she was falling off the bed.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At six o'clock the following morning, Paige was ner\-vously waiting in the second-floor corridor with Joel P
hilips, the senior resident, and five other residents, when a short, sour-faced man stormed toward them. He leaned forward as he walked, as though battling a stiff wind.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He approached the group. "What the hell are you all standing around for? Let's go!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It
 took Paige a moment to regain her composure. She hurried along to catch up with the rest of the group. As they moved along the corridor, Dr. Barker snapped, "You'll have between thirty and thirty-five patients to care for every day. I'll expect you to ma
ke detailed notes on each one of them. Clear?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There were murmurs of "Yes, sir."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They had reached the first ward. Dr. Barker walked over to the bed of a patient, a man in his forties. Barker's gruff and forbidding manner went through an instant change. He 
touched the patient gently on the shoulder and smiled. "Good morning. I'm Dr. Barker."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good morning, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How are you feeling this morning?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "My chest hurts."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker studied the chart at the foot of the bed, then turned to Dr. Philips. ' 'What do his X-rays show?''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No change. He's healing nicely."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let's do another CBC."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Philips made a note.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker patted the young man on the arm and smiled. "It's looking good. We'll have you out of here in a week." He turned to the residents and snapped, "Move it! We have a lot of patients to see."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 My God! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Talk about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next patient was an obese woman who had had apacemakerputin. Dr. Barker studied her chart. "Good morning, Mrs. Shelby." His voice was soothing. "I'm Dr. Barker."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How long are you going to keep me in this place?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, you're so charming, I'd like to keep you here forever, but I have a wife."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mrs. Shelby giggled. "She's a lucky woman."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Barker was examining her chart again. "I'd say you're just about ready to go home."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wonderful."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll stop by to see you this afternoon."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lawrence Barker turned to the residents. "Move on."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They obediently trailed behind the doctor to a semi-private room where a young Guatemalan boy lay in bed, surrounded by his anxious family.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good morning," Dr. Barker said warmly. He scanned the patient's chart. "How are you feeling this morning?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I am feeling good, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker turned to Philips. "Any change in the electrolytes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's good news." He patted the boy's arm. "You hang in there, Juan."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The mother asked anxiously, "Is my son going to be all right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker smiled. "We're going to do everything we can for him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you, doctor."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker stepped out into the corridor, the others trailing behind him. He stopped. "The patient has myocardiopathy, irregular fever tremors, headaches, and lo\-calize
d edema. Can any of you geniuses tell me what the most common cause of it is?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a silence. Paige said hesitantly, "I believe it's congenital . . . hereditary."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker looked at her and nodded encouragingly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Pleased, Paige went on. "It skips . . . wait ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was struggling to remember. "It skips a generation and is passed along by the genes of the mother.'' She stopped, flushed, proud of herself.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker stared at her a moment. "Horseshit! It's Chagas' disease. It affects people from Latin American countries." He looked at Paige with disgust. "Jesus! Who told you you were a doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's face was flaming red.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The rest of the rounds was a blur to her. They saw twenty-four patients and it seemed to Paige that Dr. Barker spent the morning 
trying to humiliate her. She was always the one Barker addressed his questions to, testing, probing. When she was right, he never compli\-
mented her. When she was wrong, he yelled at her. At one point, when Paige made a mistake, Barker roared, "I wouldn't let you operate on my dog!"
\par When the rounds were finally over, Dr. Philips, the senior resident, said, "We'll start rounds again at two o'clock. Get your scut books, make notes on each pa\-tient, and don't leave anything out."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at Paige pityingly, started to say some\-thing, then turned away to join Dr. Barker. Paige thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
never want to see that bastard again.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following night, Paige was on call. She ran from one crisis to the next, frantically trying to stem the tide of disasters that flooded the emergency rooms.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At 1:00 }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a.m., }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she finally fell asleep. She did not hear the sound of a siren screaming out its w
arning as an ambulance roared to a stop in front of the emergency entrance of the hospital. Two paramedics swung open the ambulance door, transferred the unconscious patient from his stretcher to a gurney, and ran it through the entrance doors of ER One.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The staff had been alerted by radiophone. A nurse ran alongside the patient, while a second nurse waited at the top of the ramp. Sixty seconds later, the patient was transferred from the gurney to the examination ta\-ble.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was a young man, and he was covered with so much blood that it was difficult to tell what he looked like.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A nurse went to work, cutting his torn clothes off with large shears.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It looks like everything's broken."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's bleeding like a stuck pig."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm not getting a pulse."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Who's on call?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Get her. If she hurries, he may still be alive."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was awakened by the ringing of the telephone.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "H'lo . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We have an emergency in ER One, doctor. I don't think he's going to make it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sat up on the cot. "Right. I'm coming."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She looked at her wristwatch. 1:30 }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a.m. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She stumbled out of bed and made her way to the elevator.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A minute later, she was walking into ER One. In the middle of the room, on the examining table, was the blood-covered patient.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What do we have here?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Motorcycle accident. He was hit by a bus. He wasn't wearing a helmet."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige moved toward the unconscious figure, and even before she saw his face, she somehow knew.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was suddenly wide awake. "Get three IV lines in him!" Paige ordered. "Get him on oxygen. I want some blood sent down, stat. Call Records to get his blood type."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The nurse looked at her in surprise. "You know him?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes." She had to force herself to say the words. "His name is Jimmy Ford."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige ran her fingers over his scalp. "There's heavy edema. I want a head scan and X-rays. We're going to push the envelope on this one. I want him alive!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige spent the next two hours making sure that ev\-erything possible was being done for Jimmy Ford. The X-rays showed a fractured skull, a brain contusion, bro\-
ken humerus, and multiple lacerations. But everything would have to wait until he was stabilized.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At 3:30 }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a.m., }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Paige decided there was nothing more she could do for the present. He was breathing better, and his pulse was stronger. She looked down at the unconscious figure. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
We're going to have half a dozen kids. The first girl is going to be named Paige. I hope you don't mind.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Call me if there's any change at all," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't worry, doctor," one of the nurses said. "We'll take good care of him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige made her way back to the on-call room. She was exhausted, but she was too concerned about Jimmy to go back to sleep.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The telephone rang again. She barely had the energy to pick it up. "H'lo."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Doctor, you'd better come up to the third floor.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What the hell did they teach you in medical school? Don't you even know the difference between heartburn and a heart attack?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I thought ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The problem is, you }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 didn't. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 If you ever wake me up again in the middle of the night for a heartburn case, I'll have your ass. You understand that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige stood there stiffly, her face grim.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Give her some antacid, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 doctor," }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lawrence Barker said sarcastically, "and you'll find that she's cured. I'll see you at six o'clock for rounds."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige watched him storm out.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

 He'll be very ill. He'll have a dozen tubes in his body. He'll beg me to put him out of his misery, but I won't. I'll let him suffer, and then when he feels better . . . that's when I'll kill him!}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \cbpat8 {\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was on morning rounds with the Beast, as she secretly referred to Dr. Barker. She had as\-
sisted him in three cardiothoracic surgeries, and in spite of her bitter feelings toward him, she could not help but admire his incredible skill. She watched in 
awe as he opened up a patient, deftly replaced the old heart with a donor heart, and sewed him up. The operation took less than five hours.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Within a few weeks, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 that patient will be able to return to a normal life. No wonder surgeons think they're gods. They bring the dead back to life.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Time after time, Paige watched a heart stop and turn to an inert piece of flesh. And then the miracle would occur, and a lifeless organ would begin to pulsate again and send blood through a body that had been dying.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One morning, a patient was scheduled for a procedure to insert an intraaortic balloon. Paige was in the operating room assisting Dr. Barker. As they were about to begin, Dr. Barker snapped, "Do it!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at him. "I beg your pardon?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a simple procedure. Do you think you can han\-dle it?" There was contempt in his voice.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes," Paige said tightly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, then, get on with it!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was infuriating.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Barker watched as Paige expertly inserted a hollow tube into the patient's artery and threaded it up into the heart. It was done flawlessly. Barker stood there, with\-out saying a word.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 To hell with him, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Nothing I could ever do would please him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige injected a radiopaque dye through the tube. They watched the monitor as the dye flowed into the coronary arteries. Images appeared on a fluoroscopy screen and showed the degree of blockage and its loca\-
tion in the artery, while an automatic motion-picture camera recorded the X-rays for a permanent record.
\par 
\par The senior resident looked at Paige and smiled. "Nice job."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you." Paige turned to Dr. Barker.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Too damned slow," he growled.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And he walked out.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was grateful for the days that Dr. Barker was away from the hospital, working at his private practice. She said to Kat, "Being away from him for a day is like a week in the country."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You really hate him, don't you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's a brilliant doctor, but he's a miserable human being. Have you ever noticed how some people fit their names? If Dr. Barker doesn't stop barking at people, he's going to have a stroke."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You should see some of the beauties I have to put up with." Kat laughed. "They all think they're God's gift to pussies. Wouldn't it be great if there were no men in the world!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at her, but said nothing.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Kat went to check on Jimmy Ford. He was still in a coma. There was nothing they could do.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat sighed. "Dammit. Why does it happen to the good guys?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I wish I knew."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you think he'll make it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige hesitated. "We've done everything we can. Now it's up to God."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Funny. I thought }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 we }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 were God."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following day when Paige was in charge of after\-noon rounds, Kaplan, a senior resident, stopped her in the corridor. "This is your lucky day." He grinned. "You're getting a new medical school student to take around."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Really?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yeah, the IN."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "IN?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Idiot nephew. Dr. Wallace's wife has a nephew who wants to be a doctor. They threw him out of his last two schools. We've all had to put up with him. Today it's your turn."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige groaned. "I don't have time for this. I'm up to my . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's not an option. Be a good girl and Dr. Wallace will give you brownie points." Kaplan moved off.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sighed and walked over to where the new resi\-dents were waiting to start the rounds. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Where's the IN? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She looked at her watch. He was already three minutes late. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'll}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 give him one more minute, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige decided, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 and then to hell with him. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She saw him then, a tall, lean-looking man, hurrying toward her, down the hall.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He walked up to Paige, out of breath, and said, "Ex\-cuse me. Dr. Wallace asked me to\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're late," Paige said curtly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know. I'm sorry. I was held up at\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Never mind. What's your name?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Jason. Jason Curtis." He was wearing a sport jacket.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Where's your white coat?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "My white coat?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Didn't anyone tell you to wear a white coat on rounds?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked flustered. "No. I'm afraid I ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said irritably, "Go back to the head nurse's office and tell her to give you a white coat. And you don't have a scut book."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Idiot nephew" doesn't begin to describe him. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Meet us in Ward One."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you sure? I ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Just do it!" Paige and the others started off, leaving Jason Curtis staring after them.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They were examining their third patient when Jason Curtis came hurrying up. He was wearing a white coat. Paige was saying, "... tumors of the heart can be}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 primary, which is rare, or secondary, which is much more common."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She turned to Curtis. "Can you name the three types of tumors?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He stared at her. "I'm afraid I ... I can't."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Of course not. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Epicardial. Myocardial. Endocardial."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at Paige and smiled. "That's really inter\-esting."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 My God! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Wallace or no Dr. Wal\-lace, I'm going to get rid of him fast.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They moved on to the next
 patient, and when Paige was through examining him, she took the group into the corridor, out of earshot. "We're dealing here with a thyroid storm, with fever and extreme tachycardia. It came on after surgery." She turned to Jason Curtis. "How would you t
reat him for that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He stood there, thoughtful for a moment. Then he said, "Gently?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige fought for self-control. "You're not his mother, you're his doctor! He needs continuous IV flu\-ids to combat dehydration, along with IV iodine and antithyroid drugs and sedatives for convulsions."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason nodded. "That sounds about right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The rounds got no better. When they were over, Paige called Jason Curtis aside. ' 'Do you mind my being frank with you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. Not at all," he said agreeably. "I'd appreciate it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Look for another profession."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He stood there, frowning. "You don't think I'm cut out for this?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Quite honestly, no. You don't enjoy this, do you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Not really."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Then why did you choose to go into this?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "To tell you the truth, I was pushed into it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, you tell Dr. Wallace that he's making a mis\-take. I think you should find something else to do with your life."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I really appreciate your telling me this," Jason Curtis said earnestly. "I wonder if we could discuss this further. If you aren't doing anything for dinner tonight . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We have nothing further to discuss," Paige said curtly. "You can tell your uncle ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At that moment Dr. Wallace came into view. "Ja\-son!" he called. "I've been looking all over for you." He turned to Paige. "I see you two have met."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, we've met," Paige said grimly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good. Jason is the architect in charge of designing the new wing we're building."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige stood there, motionless. "He's . . . }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 what?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. Didn't he tell you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She felt her face getting red. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Didn't anyone tell you to wear a white coat on rounds'? Why did you go into this? To tell you the truth, I was pushed into it. By me.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige wanted to crawl into a hole. He had made a complete fool of her. She turned to Jason. "Why didn't you tell me who you were?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was watching her, amused. "Well, you really didn't give me a chance."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She didn't give you a chance to what?" Dr. Wallace asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "If you'll excuse me . . ." Paige said tightly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What about dinner tonight?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't eat. And I'm busy." And Paige was gone.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason looked after her, admiringly. "That's quite a woman."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She is, isn't she? Shall we go to my office and talk about the new designs?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fine." But his thoughts were on Paige.
\par 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was July, time for the ritual that took place every twelve months at hospitals all over the United States, as new residents came in to begin their journey toward becoming real doctors.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The nurses had been looking forward to the new crop of residents, sta
king out claims on the ones they thought would make good lovers or husbands. On this particular day, as the new residents appeared, nearly every female eye was fixed on Dr. Ken Mallory.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 No one knew why Ken Mallory had transferred from an exclusive private
 hospital in Washington, D.C., to Embarcadero County Hospital in San Francisco. He was a fifth-year resident and a general surgeon. There were rumors that he had had to leave Washington in a hurry because of an affair with a congressman's wife. There was 
a
nother rumor that a nurse had committed suicide because of him and he had been asked to leave. The only thing the nurses were sure of was that Ken Mallory was, without doubt, the best-looking man they had ever seen. He had a tall, athletic body, wavy blon
d hair, and a face that would have looked great on a movie screen.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory blended into the hospital routine as though he had been there forever. He was a charmer, and almost from the beginning, the nurses were fighting for his attention. Night after night
, the other doctors would watch Mallory disappear into an empty on-call room with a different nurse. His reputation as a stud was becoming legendary around the hospital.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige, Kat, and Honey were discussing him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Can you believe all those nurses throwing them\-selves at him?" Kat laughed. "They're actually fighting to be the flavor of the week!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You have to admit, he }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 is }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 attractive," Honey pointed out.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat shook her head. "No. I don't."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One morning, half a dozen residents were in the doc\-tors' dressing room when Mallory walked in.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We were just talking about you," one of them said. "You must be exhausted."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory grinned. "It was not a bad night." He had spent the night with two nurses.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy, one of the residents, said, "You're making the rest of us look like eunuchs, Ken. Isn't there anyone in this hospital you can't lay?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory laughed. "I doubt it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy was thoughtful for a moment. "I'll bet I can name someone."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Really? Who's that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "One of the senior residents here. Her name is Kat Hunter."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory nodded. "The black doll. I've seen her. She's very attractive. What makes you think I can't take her to bed?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Because we've all struck out. I don't think she likes men."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Or maybe she just hasn't met the right one," Mal\-lory suggested.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy shook his head. "No. You wouldn't have a chance."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was a challenge. "I'll bet you're wrong."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of the other residents spoke up. "You mean you're willing to bet on it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory smiled. "Sure. Why not?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right." The group began to crowd around Mal\-lory. "I'll bet you five hundred dollars you can't lay her."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the end, five thousand dollars was bet.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Fifteen minutes later, Grundy was in the cafeteria where Kat, Paige, and Honey were having breakfast. He walked over to their table. "Can I join you ladies\emdash  you doctors\emdash for a moment?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy sat down. He looked at Kat and said apologet\-ically, "I hate to tell you this, but I'm really mad, and I think it's only fair that you should know ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was looking at him, puzzled. "Know what?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy sighed. "That new senior resident who came in\emdash Ken Mallory?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. What about him?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy said, "Well, I... God, this is embarrassing. He bet some of the doctors five thousand dollars that he could get you into bed in the next thirty days."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat's face was grim. "He did, did he?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy said piously, "I don't blame you for being angry. It made me sick when I heard about it. Well, I just wanted to warn you. He'll be asking you out, and I thought it was only right that you should know why he was doing it."
}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks," Kat said. "I appreciate your telling me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It was the least I could do."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They watched Grundy leave.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the corridor outside the cafeteria, the other resi\-dents were waiting for him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How did it go?" they asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy laughed. "Perfect. She's as mad as hell. The son of a bitch is dead meat!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At the table, Honey was saying, "I think that's just terrible."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat nodded. "Someone should give him a dickotomy. They'll be ice skating in hell before I go out with that bastard."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sat there thinking. After a moment, she said, }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You know something, Kat? It might be interesting if you }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 did }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 go out with him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat looked at her in surprise. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a glint in Paige's eye. "Why not? If he wants to play games, let's help him\emdash only he'll play }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 our }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 game."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat leaned forward. "Go on."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He has thirty days, right? When he asks you out, you'll be warm and loving and affectionate. I mean, you'll be absolutely }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 crazy }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
about the man. You'll drive him out of his mind. The only thing you }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 won't }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 do, bless your heart, is to go to bed with him. We'll teach him a five-thousand-dollar lesson."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

Jrason Curtis had been unable to get Paige Taylor out of his mind. He telephoned Ben Wallace's secretary. "Hi. This is Jason Curtis. I need a home telephone umber for Dr. Paige Taylor." "Certainly, Mr. Curtis. Just a moment." She gave him the number.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey could hear the disappointment in his voice. "If it's some kind of emergency, I can ..." "No, no."

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And that was all Honey could get out of her.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason waited two days before he called again.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This time Paige answered the telephone. "Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hello there!" Jason said. "This is Dr. Curtis."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You may not remember me," Jason said lightly. "I was on rounds with you the other day, and I asked you to have dinner with me. You said\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I said I was busy. I still am. Goodbye, Mr. Curtis." She slammed the receiver down.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What was that all about?" Honey asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "About nothing."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At six o'clock the following morning, when the resi\-dents gathered with Paige for morning rounds, Jason Curtis appeared. He was wearing a white coat.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I hope I'm not late," he said cheerfully. "I had to get a white coat. I know how upset you get when I don't wear one."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige took a deep, angry breath. "Come in here," she said. She led Jason into the deserted doctors' dress\-ing room. "What are you doing here?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "To tell you the truth, I've been worried about some of the patients we saw the other day," he said earnestly. "I came to see if everyone is all right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The man was infuriating.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why aren't you out building something?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Jason looked at her and said quietly, "I'm trying to." He pulled out a handful of tickets. "Look, I don't know what your tastes are, so I got tickets for tonight's Giants game, the theater, the opera, and a concert. Take your choice. They're non
refundable."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The man was exasperating. "Do you always throw your money away like this?''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Only when I'm in love," Jason said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wait a min\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He held the tickets out to her. "Take your choice."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige reached out and took them all. "Thank you," she said sweetly. "I'll give them to my outpatients. Most of them don't have a chance to go to the theater or opera."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He smiled. "Great! I hope they enjoy it. Will you have dinner with me?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You have to eat, anyway. Won't you change your mind?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige felt a small frisson of guilt about the tickets. "I'm afraid I wouldn't be very good company. I was on call last night, and ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll make it an early evening. Scout's honor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She sighed. "All right, but . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wonderful! Where shall I pick you up?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll be through here at seven."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll pick you up here then." He yawned. "Now I'm going home and going back to bed. What an ungodly hour to be up. What makes you do it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige watched him walk away, and she could not help smiling.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At seven o'clock that evening when Jason arrived at the hospital to pick up Paige, the supervising nurse said, "I think you'll find Dr. Taylor in the on-call room."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks." Jason walked down the corridor to the on-call room. The door was closed. He knock
ed. There was no answer. He knocked again, then opened the door and looked inside. Paige was on the cot, in a deep sleep. Jason walked over to where she lay and stood there for a long time, looking down at her. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
I'm going to marry you, lady, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. He tiptoed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following morning, Jason was in a meeting when his secretary came in with a small bouquet of flowers. The card read: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm sorry. RIP. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason laughed. He tele\-
phoned Paige at the hospital. "This is your date call\-ing."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I really am sorry about last night," Paige said. "I'm embarrassed."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't be. But I have a question."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Does RIP stand for Rest in Peace or Rip as in Van Winkle?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige laughed. "Take your choice."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "My choice is dinner tonight. Can we try again?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She hesitated. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I don't want to become involved. You're not still hung up on Alfred, are you?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hello. Are you there?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One evening won't do any harm, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige de\-cided. "Yes. We can have dinner." "Wonderful."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Paige was getting dressed that evening, Kat said, "It looks like you have a heavy date. Who is it?" "He's a doctor-architect," Paige said. "A }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 what?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige told her the story.
\par "He sounds like fun. Are you interested in him?" "Not really."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The evening went by pleasantly. Paige found Jason easy to be with. They talked about everything and noth\-ing, and the time seemed to fly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Tell me about you," Jason said. "Where did you grow up?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You won't believe me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I promise I will."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right. The Congo, India, Burma, Nigeria, Kenya . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't believe you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's true. My father worked for WHO."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Who? I give up. Is this going to be an Abbott and Costello rerun?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The World Health Organization. He was a doctor. I spent my childhood traveling to most of the Third World countries with him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That must have been difficult for you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It was exciting. The hardest part was that I was never able to stay long enough to make friends." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 We don't need anyone else, Paige. We'll always have each other. . . . This is my wife, Karen. }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She shook off the memory. "I learned a lot of strange languages, and exotic customs."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "For instance?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, for instance, I ..." She thought for a mo\-ment. "In India they believe in life after death, and that the ne
xt life depends on how you behaved in this one. If you were bad, you would come back as an animal. I remember that in one village, we had a dog, and I used to wonder who he used to be and what he did that was bad."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason said, "He probably barked up the wrong tree."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige smiled. "And then there was the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 gherao."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 gherao?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a very powerful form of punishment. A crowd surrounds a man." She stopped.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's it?"
\par "They don't say anything or do anything. But he can't move, and he can
't get away. He's trapped until he gives in to what they want. It can last for many, many hours. He stays inside the circle, but the crowd keeps changing shifts. I saw a man try to escape the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 gherao }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
once. They beat him to death."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The memory of it made Paige shudder. The normally friendly people had turned into a screaming, frenzied mob. "Let's get away from here," Alfred had yelled. He had taken her arm and led her to a quiet side street.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's terrible," Jason said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "My father moved us away the next day."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I wish I could have known your father."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He was a wonderful doctor. He would have been a big success on Park Avenue, but he wasn't interested in money. His only interest was in helping people." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Like Alfred, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
she thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He loved doing what he did. In the beginning, the natives fought him. They were very superstitious. In the remote Indian villages, everyone has }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 ajatak, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a horo\-
scope done by the village astrologer, and they live by it." She smiled. "I loved having mine done."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And did they tell you that you were going to marry a handsome young architect?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at him and said firmly, "No." The conversation was getting too personal. "You're an ar\-chitect, so you'll apprec
iate this. I grew up in huts made of wattle, with earthen floors and thatched roofs where mice and bats liked to nest. I lived in }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 tukuls }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
with grass roofs and no windows. My dream was to live one day in a comfortable two-story house with a veranda and a green lawn and a white picket fence, and ..." Paige stopped. "Sorry. I didn't mean to go on like this, but you }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 did }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 ask."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm glad I asked," Jason said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

She thought of something Kat had said to her. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 You're clinging to a ghost. Let go. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She looked at Jason and said, "Yes."

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Early the following morning, a messenger arrived with a package. Paige opened the door for him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I have something for Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes," Paige said patiently. "I'm a doctor. Do you mind?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He shrugged. "No, lady. Not at all. Would you sign here, please?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Th
e package was surprisingly heavy. Curious, Paige carried it to the living-room table and unwrapped it. It was a miniature model of a beautiful white two-story house with a veranda. In front of the house was a little lawn and garden, surrounded by a white 
picket fence. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He must have stayed up all night, making it. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a card that read:

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She sat there looking at it for a long time. It was the right house, but it was the wrong man.

\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 What's the matter with me? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige asked herself. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He's bright and attractive and charming. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 But she knew what the matter was. He was not Alfred.}{

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll make it an early evening. By the way, it's going to be at my parents' home."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's fine," Paige said. Things were moving too quickly. It made her nervous.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige hung up, she thought: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 really shouldn't be doing this. By tonight I'm going to be too tired to do anything but go to sleep. }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was tempted to tele\-phone Jason back and cancel their date. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It's too late to do that now. We'll make it an early evening.

Jason's mother and father lived in a charming old house in the Pacific Heights district. Jason's father was an aristocratic-looking man in his seventies. Jason's mother was a warm, down-to-earth woman. They made Paige feel instantly at home.

\par "Jason has told us so much about you," Mrs. Curtis said. "He didn't tell us how beautiful you are."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige laughed. "I believe it." Her eyes were getting heavy and she was fighting to stay awake.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason was watching her, concerned. "Let's go in to dinner," he suggested.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They went into the large dining room. It was oak-paneled, furnished with attractive antiques and portraits on the wall. A maid began serving.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason's father said, "That painting over there is Ja\-son's great-grandfather. All the buildings he designed were destroyed in the earthquake of 1906. It's too bad. They were priceless. I'll show you s

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Saturday evening, Kat and Ken Mallory had dinner at Emilio's, a restaurant on the bay. She had dressed carefully for him, in a white cotton dress, off the shoul\-der.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You look sensational," Mallory said. He was care\-ful to strike just the right note. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Appreciative, but not pressing. Admiring, but not suggestive. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Mallory had determined to be at his most charming, but it was not necessary. It quickly became obvious to him that Kat was intent on charming }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Over a drink, Kat said, "Everyone talks about what a wonderful doctor you are, Ken."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well," Mallory said modestly, "I've had fine train\-ing, and I care a lpt about my patients. They're very important to me." His voice was filled with sincerity.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat put her hand over his. "I'm sure they are. Where are you from? I want to know all about you. The }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 real }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

He could not get over how easy this was going to be. He was an expert on the subject of women. His radar knew all the signals they put out. They could say yes with a look, a smile, a tone of voice. Kat's signals were jam\-ming his radar.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was leaning close to him, and her voice was husky. "I want to know everything."

\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She's crazy about me, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory decided. He wished now that he had taken more bets. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 might even win tonight, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. And he was sure of it when Kat said, as they were having coffee, "Would you like to come up to my apartment for a nightcap?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bingo! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory stroked her arm and said softly, "I'd love to." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The guys were all crazy, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory decided.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She's the horniest broad I've ever met. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He had a feeling that he was about to be raped.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh." She could hear the note of regret in his voice.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat gave him a beguiling smile. "But they won't be home until much later."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Love one." He watched as Kat walked over to the little bar and mixed two drinks. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She's got great buns, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And s

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm the lucky one," Kat said warmly. She handed him his drink.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory raised his glass and started to say, "Here's to . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat beat him to it. "Here's to us!" she said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He nodded. "I'll drink to that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He started to say, "How about a little music?" and as he opened his mouth, Kat said, "Would you like some music?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're a mind reader."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat put on an old Cole Porter standard. She surreptitiously glanced at her watch, then turned to Mallory. "Do you like to dance?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory moved closer to her. "It depends on whom I'm dancing with. I'd love to dance with you."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat moved into his arms, and they began to dance to the slow and dreamy music. He felt Kat's body press\-ing hard against his, and he could feel himself getting aroused. He held her tighter, and Kat smiled up at him.}{

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're lovely, you know," Mallory said huskily. "I've wanted you since the first moment I saw you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat looked into his eyes. "I've felt the same way about you, Ken." His lips moved toward hers, and he gave her a warm, passionate kiss.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let's go into the bedroom," Mallory said. There was a sudden urgency in him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He took her by the arm and she started leading him toward her bedroom. And at that moment, the front door opened and Paige and Honey walked in.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hi there!" Paige called. She looked at Ken Mallory in surprise. "Oh, Dr. Mallory! I didn't expect to see you here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, I ... I ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We went out to dinner," Kat said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was filled with a dark rage. He fought to control it. He turned to Kat. "I should go. It's late and I have a big day tomorrow."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh. I'm sorry you're leaving," Kat said. There was a world of promise in her eyes.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory said, "What about tomorrow night?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat frowned. "Oh, dear. I'm afraid Friday isn't good, either."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was getting desperate. "Saturday?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat smiled. "Saturday would be lovely."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He nodded, relieved. "Good. Saturday it is, then."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He turned to Paige and Honey. "Good night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat walked Mallory to the door. "Sweet dreams," ahe said softly. "I'm going to dream about you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory squeezed her hand. "I believe in making dreams come true. We'll make up for this Saturday night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I can't wait."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That night, Kat lay in her bed thinking about Mallory. She hated him. But to her surprise, she had enjoyed the evening. She was sure that Mallory had enjoyed it too, in spite of the fact that he was playing a game. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 If only this were real, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 and not a game. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She had no idea how dangerous a game it was.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Maybe it's the weather, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought wearily. It was cold and dreary outside, with a gray driving ra
in that depressed the spirits. Her day had begun at six o'clock in the morning, and it was filled with constant problems. The hospital seemed tc be full of gomers, all complaining at once. The nurses were surly and careless. They drew blood from the wrong
 patients, lost X-rays that were urgently needed, and snapped at the patients. In addition, there was a staff shortage because of a flu epidemic. It was that kind of day.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The only bright spot was the telephone call from Jason Curtis.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hello," he said cheerily. "Just thought I'd check in and see how all our patients are doing."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige laughed. "What's lunch? If I'm lucky, I'll be able to grab a stale sandwich about four o'clock this afternoon. It's pretty hectic around here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right. I won't keep you. May I call you again?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 No harm in that.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Paige worked until midnight without a moment to rest, and when she was finally relieved, she was almost too tired to move. She briefly debated staying at the hospital and sleeping on the cot in the on-call room, but the thought of her warm, cozy bed at ho
me was too tempting. She changed clothes and lurched her way to the elevator.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Peterson came up to her. "My God!" he said. "Where's the cat that dragged you in?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige smiled wearily. "Do I look that bad?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Worse." Peterson grinned. "You're going home now?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige nodded.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're lucky. I'm just starting."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The elevator arrived. Paige stood there half asleep.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Peterson said gently, "Paige?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She shook herself awake. "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you going to be able to drive home?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sure," Paige mumbled. "And when I get there, I'm going to sleep for twenty-four hours straight.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She walked to the parking lot and got into her car. She sat there drained, too tired to turn on the ignition. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
mustn't go to sleep here. I'll sleep at home.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige drove out of the parking lot and headed toward the apartment}{\b\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 . }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was unaware of how erratically she was driving until}{\b\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a driver yelled at her, "Hey, get off the}{\b\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 road, you drunken broad!"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She forced herself to concentrate. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 must not fall asleep . . . I must not fall asleep. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She snapped the radio on and turned the volume up loud. When she reached her apartment building, she sat in the car for a long time before she was able to summon enough strength to go upstairs.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat and Honey were in their beds, asleep. Paige looked at the clock at her bedside. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One o'clock in the morning. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She stumbled into her bedroom and started to get undressed, but the effort was too much for her. She fell into bed with her clothes on, and in an instant was sound asleep.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Sh
e was awakened by the shrill ringing of a telephone that seemed to be coming from some far-off planet. Paige fought to stay asleep, but the ringing was like needles penetrating her brain. She sat up groggily and reached for the phone. "H'lo?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes." Her voice was a hoarse mumble.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Barker wants you in OR Four to assist him, stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige cleared her throat. "There must be some mis\-take," she mumbled. "I just got off duty."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "OR Four. He's waiting." The line went dead.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Paige sat on the edge of the bed, numb, her mind clouded by sleep. She looked at the clock on the bedside table. Four-fifteen. Why was Dr. Barker asking for her in the middle of the night? There was only one answer. Something had happened to one of her pa
tients.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige staggered into the bathroom and threw cold water on her face. She looked in the mirror and thought,}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 My Godl I look like my mother. No. My mother never looked this bad.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ten minutes later, Paige was making her way back to the hospital. She was
 still half asleep when she took the elevator to the fourth floor to OR Four. She went into the dressing room and changed, then scrubbed up and stepped into the operating room.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There were three nurses and a resident assisting Dr. Barker.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked up as Paige entered and yelled, "For Christ's sake, you're wearing a hospital gown! Didn't anyone ever inform you that you're supposed to wear }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 scrubs }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
in an operating room?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige stood there, stunned, jolted wide awake, her eyes blazing. "You listen to me," she said, furiously. "I'm supposed to be off duty. I came in as a favor to you. I don't\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't argue with me," Dr. Barker said curtly. "Get over here and hold this retractor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige walked over to the operating table and looked down. It was not her patient on the table. It was a stranger. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Barker had no reason to call me. He's trying to force me to quit the hospital. Well, I'll be damned if I willl }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She gave him a baleful look, picked up the retractor, and went to work.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The operation was an emergency coronary artery by\-
pass graft. The skin incision had already been made down the center of the chest to the breastbone, which had been split with an electric saw. The heart and major blood vessels were exposed.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige inserted the metal retractor between the cut sides of the breastbone, forcing the edges apart. She watched as Dr. Barker skillfully opened the pericardial sac, exposing the heart.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He indicated the coronary arteries. "Here's the prob\-lem," Barkersaid. "We're going to do some grafting."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He had already rem
oved a long strip of vein from one leg. He sewed a piece of it into the main artery coming out of the heart. The other end he attached to one of the coronary arteries, beyond the obstructed area, sending the blood through the vein graft, bypassing the obs
truction.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was watching a master at work. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 If only he weren't such a bastardl}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The operation took three hours. By the time it was over, Paige was only half conscious. When the incision had been closed, Dr. Barker turned to the staff and said, "I want to thank all of you." He was not looking at Paige.

\par Paige stumbled out of the room without a word and went upstairs to the office of Dr. Benjamin Wallace.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace was just arriving. "You look exhausted," he said. "You should get some rest."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige took a deep breath to control her anger. "I want to be transferred to another surgical team."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace studied her a moment. "You're assigned to Dr. Barker, right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's the problem?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ask }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 him. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He hates me. He'll be glad to get rid of me. I'll go with anyone else. Anyone."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll talk to him," Wallace said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige turned and walked out of the office. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They'd better take me away from him. If I see him again, I'll kill him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige went home and slept for twelve hours. She woke up with a feeling that something wonderful had happened, and then she remembered. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I don't have to see the Beast anymore! }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She drove to the hospital, whistling.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Paige was walking down the corridor, an orderly came up to her. "Dr. Taylor ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Wallace would like to see you in his office."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you," Paige said. She wondered who the new senior surgeon would be. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Anybody will be an im\-provement, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. She walked into Benjamin Wallace's office.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, you look much better today, Paige."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks. I feel much better." And she did. She felt great, filled with an enormous sense of relief.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I talked to Dr. Barker."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige smiled. "Thank you. I really appreciate it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He won't let you go."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's smile faded. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 What?}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He said you're assigned to his team and you'll stay there."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She could not believe what she was hearing. "But }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 why?" }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She knew why. The sadistic bastard needed a whipping girl, someone to humiliate. "I'm not going to stand for it."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Wallace said ruefully, "I'm afraid you have no choice. Unless you want to leave the hospital. Would you like to think about it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige did not have to think about it. "No." She was not going to let Barker force her to quit. That was his plan. "No," she repeated slowly. "I'll stay."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good. Then that's settled."
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Not by a long shot, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to find some way to pay him back.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the doctors' dressing room, Ken Mallory was get\-ting ready to make his rounds. Dr. Grundy and three other doctors walked in.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's our man!" Grundy said. "How are you doing, Ken?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Grundy turned to the others. "He doesn't look like he just got laid, does he?" He turned back to Mallory. "I hope you have our money ready. I plan to make a down payment on a little car."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Another doctor joined in. "I'm buying a whole new wardrobe."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory shook his head pityingly. "I wouldn't count on it, suckers. Get ready to pay me off!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't worry," Kat said grimly. "He's going to lose."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Ken Mallory picked Kat up Saturday night, she had on a low-cut dress that accentuated her voluptuous figure.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You look gorgeous," he said admiringly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She put her arms around him. "I want to look good for you." She was clinging to him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 God, she really wants it. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Mallory spoke, his voice was husky. "Look, I have an idea, Kat. Before we go out to dinner, why don't we slip into the bedroom and . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was stroking his face. "Oh, darling, I wish we could. Paige is home." Paige was actually at the hospi\-tal, working.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But after dinner ..." She let the suggestion hang in the air.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We could go to your place."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory put his arms around her and kissed her. "That's a wonderful idea!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He took her to the Iron Horse, and they had a delicious dinner. In spite of herself, Kat was ha
ving a wonderful time. He was charming and amusing, and incredibly attractive. He seemed genuinely interested in knowing everything about her. She knew he was flattering her, but he really seemed to mean the compliments he paid her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 If I didn't know better . . .
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory had hardly tasted his food. All he could think was, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In two hours I will be making ten thousand dollars. . . . In one hour, I will be making ten thousand dol\-
lars. . . . In thirty minutes . . .
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They finished their coffee.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you ready?" Mallory asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat put her hand over his. "You have no idea how ready, darling. Let's go."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They took a taxi to Mallory's apartment. "I'm abso\-lutely crazy about you," Mallory murmured. "I've never known anyone like you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And she could hear Grundy's voice: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He's so sure of himself that he says he's going to get you into bed by Saturday night.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they arrived at the apartment, Mallory paid the taxi driver and led Kat into the elevator. It seemed to Mallory to take forever to get up to his apartment. He opened the door and said eagerly, "Here it is."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat stepped inside.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was an ordinary little bachelor's apartment that desperately needed a woman's touch.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, it's lovely," Kat breathed. She turned to Mal\-lory. "It's }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 you.'"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He grinned. "Let me show you }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 our }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 room. I'll put some music on."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As he went over to the tape deck, Kat glanced at her watch. The voice of Barbra Streisand filled the room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory took her hand. "Let's go, honey."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wait a minute," Kat said softly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was looking at her, puzzled. "What for?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I just want to enjoy this moment with you. You know, before we ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why don't we enjoy it in the bedroom?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'd love a drink."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A drink?" He tried to hide his impatience. "Fine. What would you like?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A vodka and tonic, please."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He smiled. "I think we can handle that." He went over to the little bar and hurriedly mixed two drinks.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat looked at her watch again.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory returned with the drinks and handed one to Kat. "Here you are, baby." He raised his glass. "To togetherness."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "To togetherness," Kat said. She took a sip of the drink. "Oh, my God!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at her, startled. "What's the matter?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This is vodka!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's what you asked for."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did I? I'm sorry. I hate vodka!" She stroked his face. "May I have a scotch and soda?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sure." He swallowed his impatience and went back to the bar to mix another drink.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat glanced at her watch again.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ken Mallory returned. "Here you are."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you, darling."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She took two sips of her drink. Mallory took the glass from her and set it on a table. He put his arms around Kat and held her close, and she could feel that he was aroused.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Now," Ken said softly, "let's make history."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, yes!" Kat said. "Yes!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She let him lead her into the bedroom.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I've done it! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory exulted. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I've done it. Here go the walls of Jericho! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He turned to Kat. "Get undressed, baby."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You first, darling. I want to watch you get un dressed. It excites me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh? Well, sure."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Kat stood there watching, Mallory slowly took his clothes off. First his jacket, then his shirt and tie, then his shoes and stockings, and then his trousers. He had the firm figure of an athlete.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Does this excite you, baby?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, yes. Now take off your shorts."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Slowly Mallory let his shorts fall to the floor. He had a turgid erection.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's beautiful," Kat said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Now it's your turn."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And at that moment, Kat's beeper went off.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was startled. "What the hell . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "They're calling me," Kat said. "May I use your telephone?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Now?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. It must be an emergency."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 'Wow? Can't it wait?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Darling, you know the rules."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Mallory watched, Kat walked over to the telephone and dialed a number. "Dr. Hunter." She lis\-tened. "Really? Of course. I'll be right there."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was staring at her, stupefied. "What's going on?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I have to get back to the hospital, angel."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Now?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. One of my patients is dying."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Can't he wait until . . . ?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry. We'll do this another night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ken Mallory stood there, buck naked, watching Kat walk out of his apartment, and as the door closed behind her, he picked up her drink and slammed it into the wall. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Bitch . . . bitch }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 . . . }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 bitch . . .
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Kat got back to the apartment, Paige and Honey were eagerly waiting for her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How did it go?" Paige asked. "Was I on time?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat laughed. "Your timing was perfect."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She began to describe the evening. When she came to the part about Mallory standing in the bedroom naked, with an erection, they laughed until tears came to their eyes.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was tempted to tell them how enjoyable she really found Ken Mallory, but she felt foolish. After all, he was seeing her only so he could win a bet.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Somehow, Paige seemed to sense how Kat felt. "Be careful of him, Kat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat smiled. "Don't worry. But I will admit that if I didn't know about that bet ... He's a snake, but he gives good snake oil."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "When are you going to see him again?" Honey asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm going to give him a week to cool off." Paige was studying her. "Him or you?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dinetto's black limous
ine was waiting outside the hospital for Kat. This time, the Shadow was alone. Kat wished that Rhino were there. There was something about the Shadow that petrified her. He never smiled and seldom spoke, but he exuded menace.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Get in," he said as Kat approached the car.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Look," Kat said indignantly, "you tell Mr. Dinetto that he can't order me around. I don't work for him. Just because I did him a favor once ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Get in. You can tell him yourself."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat hesitated. It would be easy to walk away and not get involved any further, but how would it affect Mike? Kat got into the car.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The victim this time had been badly beaten, whipped with a chain. Lou Dinetto was there with him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat took one look at the patient and said, "You've got to get him to a hospital right away."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Kat," Dinetto said, "you have to treat him here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why?" Kat demanded. But she knew the answer, and it terrified her.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason had arranged to pick up Paige at the apartment. When he arrived, Paige was surprised at how pleased she was to see him.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No problem." Jason drove her to the hospital.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I won't be long," Paige promised as she got out of the car.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll wait for you here."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige went up to the third floor and into Jimmy Ford's room. He was still in a coma, attached to an array of tubes feeding him intravenously.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A nurse was in the room. She looked up as Paige entered. "Good morning, Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good morning." Paige walked over to the boy's bedside. "Has there been any change?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm afraid not."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige felt Jimmy's pulse and listened to his heartbeat.
\par "It's been several weeks now," the nurse said. "It doesn't look good, does it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's going to come out of it," Paige said firmly. She turned to the unconscious figure on the bed and raised her voice. "Do you hear me? 
You're going to get well!" There was no reaction. She closed her eyes a moment and said a silent prayer. "Have them beep me at once if there's any change."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason got out of the car as Paige approached. "Is everything all right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was no point in burdening him with her prob\-lems. "Everything's fine," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let's play real tourists today," Jason said. "There's a state law that all tours have to start at Fisherman's Wharf."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige smiled. "We mustn't break the law."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
\par Fisherman's Wharf was like an outdoor carnival. The street entertainers were out in full force. There were mimes, clowns, dancers, and musicians. Vendors were selling steaming caldrons of Dungeness crabs and clam chowder with fresh sourdough bread.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's no place like this in the world," Jason said warmly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was touched by his enthusiasm. She had seen Fisherman's Wharf before and most of the other tourist sites of San Francisco, but she did not want to spoil his fun.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Have you ridden a cable car yet?" Jason asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They walked to Powell Street and boarded a cable car. As they started up the steep grade, Jason said, "This was known as Hallidie's Folly. He built it in 1873."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And I'll bet they said it wouldn't last!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason laughed. "That's right. When I was going to high school, I used to work weekends as a tour guide."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason adopted the nasal tone of a tour guide. "Ladies and gentlemen, for your information, the oldest street in San Francisco is Grant Avenue, the longest is Mission Street\emdash seven and a half miles long\emdash 
the widest is Van Ness Avenue at one hundred twenty-five feet, and you'll tbe surprised to know that the narrowest, DeForest Street, is only four and a half feet. 
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, four and a half feet. The steepest street we can offer you is Filbert Street, with a thirty-one and a half percent grade." He looked at Paige and grinned. "I'm surprised that I still remember all that."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they alighted from the cable car, Paige looked up at Jason and smiled. "What's next?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're going to take a carriage ride."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ten minutes later, they were seated in a horse-drawn carriage that took them from Fisherman's Wharf to Ghirardelli Square to North Beach. Jaso
n pointed out the places of interest along the way, and Paige was surprised at how much she was enjoying herself. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Don't let yourself get carried away.
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They went up to Coit Tower for a view of the city. As they ascended, Jason asked, "Are you hungry?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The fresh air had made Paige very hungry. "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good. I'm going to take you to one of the best Chinese restaurants in the world\emdash Tommy Toy's."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige had heard the hospital staff speak of it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The meal 
turned out to be a banquet. They started with lobster pot stickers with chili sauce, and hot and sour soup with seafood. That was followed by filet of chicken with snow peas and pecans, veal filet with Szechuan sauce, and four-flavored fried rice. For des
\-sert, they had a peach mousse. The food was wonderful.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you come here often?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "As often as I can."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a boyish quality about Jason that Paige found very attractive.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Tell me," Paige said, "did you always want to be an architect?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I had no choice." Jason grinned. "My first toys were Erector sets. It's exciting to dream about some\-
thing and then watch that dream become concrete and bricks and stone, and soar up into the sky and become apart of the city you live in."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to build you a Taj Mahal. I don't care how long it takes!
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm one of the lucky ones, Paige, spending my life doing what I love to do. Who was it who said, 'Most people live lives of quiet desperation'?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Sounds like a lot of my patients, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's nothing else I would want to do, or any other place I would want to live. This is a fabulous city." His voice was filled with excitement. "It has everything anyone could want. I never get tired of it."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige studied him for a moment, enjoying his enthusi\-asm. "You've never been married?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason shrugged. "Once. We were both too young. It didn't work out."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No need to be. She's married to a very wealthy meat packer. Have you been married?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to be a doctor, too, when I grow up. We'll married, and we'll work together.
\par  }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 'No."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They took a bay cruise under the Golden Gate and Bay Bridge. Jason assumed his tour guide's voice again.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And there, ladies and gentlemen, is the storied Alcatraz, former home of some of the world's most infamous criminals\emdash Machine Gun Kelly, Al Capone, and Robert Stroud, known as the Birdman! 'Alcatraz' means peli\-
can in Spanish. It was originally called Isla de los Alcatraces, after the birds that were its only inhabitants. Do you know why they had hot showers every day for the prisoners here?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "So that they wouldn't get used to the cold bay water when they were trying to escape."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Is that true?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Have I ever lied to you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was late afternoon when Jason said, "Have you ever been to Noe Valley?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige shook her head. "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'd like to show it to you. It used to be farms and streams. Now it's filled with brightly colored Victorian homes and gardens. The houses are very old, because it was about the only area spared in the 1906 earthquake."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It sounds lovely."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason hesitated. "My home is there. Would you like to see it?" He saw Paige's reaction. "Paige, I'm in love with you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We hardly know each other. How could you . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I knew it from the moment you said, 'Don't you know you're supposed to wear a white coat on rounds?' That's when I fell in love with you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Jason . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm a firm believer in love at first sight. My grandfa\-ther saw my grandmother riding a bicycle in the park and he followed her, and they got married three months later. They 
were together for fifty years, until he died. My father saw my mother crossing a street, and he knew she was going to be his wife. They've been married for forty-five years. You see, it runs in the family. I want to marry you."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was the moment of truth.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at Jason and thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
He's the first man I've been attracted to since Alfred. He's adorable and bright and genuine. He's everything a woman could want in a man. What's the matter with me! I'm holding on to a ghost. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Yet deep inside her, she s
till had the overpowering feeling that one day Alfred was going to come back to her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She looked at Jason and made her decision.' 'Jason..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And at that moment, Paige's beeper went off. It sounded urgent, ominous.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paige ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I have to get to a telephone." Two minutes later, she was talking to the hospital.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason watched Paige's face turn pale.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was shouting into the telephone, "No! Abso\-lutely not! Tell them I'll be right there." She slammed the phone down.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What is it?" Jason asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She turned to him, and her eyes were filled with tears. "It's Jimmy Ford, my patient. They're going to take him off the respirator. They're going to let him die."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige reached Jimmy Ford's room, there were three people there beside the comatose figure in bed: George Englund, Benjamin Wallace, and a lawyer, Silvester Damone.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Paige stood there looking down at him, tears blurring the room. "Damn you!" she said. "You're a quitter!" She was sobbing now. "What happened to those dreams of yours? I thought you wanted to become a doctor! Answer me! Do you hear me? Open your eyes!" Sh
e looked down at the pale figure. There was no reaction. "I'm sorry," Paige said. "I'm so sorry." She leaned down to kiss him on the cheek, and as she slowly straightened up, she was looking into his open eyes.

\par "Jimmy! }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jimmy}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 '!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He blinked and closed his ey

Honey was happier than she had ever been in her life. She had a warm relationship with patients that few of the other doctors had. She genuinely cared about them. She worked in geriatrics, in pediat\-rics, and in various other wards, and Dr. Wallace sa
w to it that she was given assignments that kept her out of harm's way. He wanted to make sure that she stayed at the hospital and was available to him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey envied the nurses. They were able to nurture their patients without worrying about major medical decisions.  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I never wanted to be a doctor,  }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey thought. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 always wanted to be a nurse. There are no nurses in the Taft family.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the afternoons when Honey left the hospital, she would go shopping at the Bay Company, and Streetlight Records, and buy gifts for the children in pediatric care.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I love children," she told Kat.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you planning to have a large family?" "Someday," Honey said wistfully. "I have to find their father first."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of Honey's favorite patients in the geriatric ward was Daniel M
cGuire, a cheerful man in his nineties who was suffering from a diseased liver condition. He had been a gambler in his youth, and he liked to make bets with Honey.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll bet you fifty cents the orderly is late with my breakfast."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey laughed. "Never mind. I like older men."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One morning a letter came to him addressed to the hospital. Honey took it to him in his room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Read it to me, would you?" His eyesight had faded.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Of course," Honey said. She opened the envelope, looked at it a moment, and let out a cry. "You've won the lottery! Fifty thousand dollars! Congratulations!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How about that?" He yelled. "I always knew I'd win the lottery one day! Give me a hug."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey leaned down and hugged him.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Honey came back to visit him that afternoon, he had passed away.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was in the doctors' lounge when Dr. Stevens}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 walked in. "Is there a Virgo here?" One of the doctors laughed. "If you mean a virgin, I doubt it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Virgo," }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Stevens repeated. "I need a Virgo." "I'm a Virgo," Honey said. "What's the problem?" He walked up to her. "The problem is that I have a}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 goddam maniac on my hands. She won't let anyone near her but a Virgo." Honey got up. "I'll go see her." "Thanks. Her name is Frances Gordon."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Frances Gordon had just had a hip replacement. The moment Honey walked into the room, the woman looked up and said, "You're a Virgo. Born on the cusp, right?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey smiled. "That's right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ha! Most of them are in it for the money." She looked at Honey more closely. "You're different."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey scanned the chart at the foot of the bed, a surprised look on her face.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's the matter? What are you lookin' at?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Has he beaten you up before?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, but he ... he doesn't mean anything by it. He gets drunk and loses his temper."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why haven't you left him?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mrs. Owens shrugged, and the movement caused her pain. "The kids and I have nowhere to go."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was listening, furious. "You don't have to take this, you know. There are shelters and agencies that will take care of you and protect you and the children."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The woman shook her head in despair. "I have no money. I lost my job as a secretary when he started ..." She could not go on.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey squeezed her hand. "You're going to be fine. I'll see that you're taken care of."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Five minutes later Honey marched into Dr. Wallace's office. He was delighted to see her. He wondered what she had brought with her this time. At various times, she had used warm honey, hot water, melted chocolate, and\emdash 
his favorite\emdash maple syrup. Her ingenuity was boundless.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Lock the door, baby."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She told him about her patient.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You'll have to file a police report," Wallace said. "It's the law."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The law hasn't protected her before. Look, all she wants to do is get away from her husband. She worked as a secretary. Didn't you say you needed a new file clerk?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, yes, but . . . wait a minute!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks," Honey said. "We'll get her on her feet, and find her a place to live, and she'll have a new job!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace sighed. "I'll see what I can do." "I knew you would," Honey said.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The next morning, Honey went back to see Mrs. Owens.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Your husband is'not going to bother you anymore," Honey said firmly. "You'll stay here until we find a place for you and the children to live, and when you're well enough, you're going to have a job here at the hospital."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mrs. Owens stared at her unbelievingly. "Do . . . do you mean that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Absolutely. You'll have your own apartment with your children. You won't have to put up with the kind of horror you've been living through, and you'll have a decent, respectable job."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mrs. Owens clutched Honey's hand. "I don't know how to thank you," she sobbed. "You don't know what it has been like."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I can imagine," Honey said. "You're going to be fine."

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Ritter was waiting for her in Room 215. In bed was an Indian man in his late twenties.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Ritter said, "This is your patient?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

Benjamin Wallace yelled.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm afraid so."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you absolutely }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 sure?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 By law, all cases of cholera and other infectious dis\-eases must immediately be reported to the state health board and to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, no," Wallace said. "Anyone can make a mistake. Let's not be hasty. Does the patient's chart read stomach flu?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wallace made his decision. "Let's leave it that way. Here's what I want you to do. Start intravenous rehydration\emdash 
use lactated Ringer's solution. Also give him tetracycline. If we can restore his blood volume and fluid immediately, he could be close to normal in a few hours."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Give them tetracycline, too. What's the patient's name?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Pandit Jawah."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Put him in quarantine for forty-eight hours. He'll either be cured by then or dead."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was in a panic. She went to find Paige. "I need your help." "What's the problem?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He said he feels terrible. I told him he's going to get well. He said to tell it to God. I told him we're going to start treatment immediately. He said he's grateful."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Cholera is a disease that can cause death within twenty-four hours from dehydration, or that can be cured within a few hours.
\par Five hours after his treatment began, Pandit Jawah was nearly back to normal.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige stopped in to see Jimmy Ford.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 His face lit up when he saw her. "Hi." His voice was weak, but he had improved miraculously.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How are you feeling?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Great. Did you hear about the doctor who said to his patient, 'The best thing you can do is give up smok\-ing, stop drinking, and cut down on your sex life? }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ken Mallory was getting off duty and was on his way to meet Kat when he heard his name being paged. He hesitated, debatin
g whether or not simply to slip out. His name was paged once more. Reluctantly, he picked up a telephone. "Dr. Mallory."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Doctor, could you come to ER Two, please? We have a patient here who\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's no one else available who can handle this. It's a bleeding ulcer, and the patient's condition is criti\-cal. I'm afraid we're going to lose him if . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Damn! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right. I'll be right there." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'll}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 have to call Kat and tell her I'll be late.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The patient in the emergency room was a man in his sixties. He was semiconscious, ghost-pale, perspiring, and breathing hard, obviously in enormous pain. Mal\-lory took one look at him and said, "Get him into an OR, stat!"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Fifteen minutes later, Mallory had the patient on an operating table. The anesthesiologist was monitoring his blood pressure. "It's dropping fast."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Pump some more blood into him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ken Mallory began the operation, working against time. It took only a moment to cut through the skin, and after 
that, the layer of fat, the fascia, the muscle, and finally the smooth, transparent peritoneum, the lining of the abdomen. Blood was pouring into the stomach.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Bovie!" Mallory said. "Get me four units of blood from the blood bank." He began to cauterize the bleed\-ing vessels.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The operation took four hours, and when it was over, Mallory was exhausted. He looked down at the patient and said, "He's going to live."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of the nurses gave Mallory a warm smile. "It's a good thing you were here, Dr. Mallory."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked over at her. She was young and pretty and obviously open to an invitation. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'll get to you later, baby, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Mallory thought. He turned to a junior resident, "Close him up and get him into the recovery room. I'll check on him in the morning."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory debated whether to telephone Kat, but it was midnight. He sent her two dozen roses.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Mallory checked in at 6:00 }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a.m., }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he stopped by the recovery room to see his new patient.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's awake," the nurse said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory walked over to the bed. "I'm Dr. Mallory. How do you feel?''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
"When I think of the alternative, I feel fine," the patient said weakly. "They tell me you saved my life. This was the damnedest thing. I was in the car on my way to a dinner party, and I got this sudden pain and I guess I blacked out
. Fortunately, we were only a block away from the hospital, and they brought me to the emergency room here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You were lucky. You lost a lot of blood."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "They told me that in another ten minutes, I would have been gone. I want to thank you, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory shrugged. "I was just doing my job."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The patient was studying him carefully. "I'm Alex Harrison."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The name meant nothing to Mallory. "Glad to know you, Mr. Harrison." He was checking Harrison's pulse.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you in any pain now?" "A bit, but I guess they have me pretty well doped}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 up."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The anesthetic will wear off," Mallory assured him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "So will the pain. You're going to be fine." "How long will I have to be in the hospital?" "We should have you out of here in a few days." A clerk from the business office ca
me in, carrying some hospital forms. "Mr. Harrison, for our records, the hospital needs to know whether you have medical coverage."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You mean you want to know if I can pay my bill."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, I wouldn't put it like that, sir."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You might check with the San Francisco Fidelity Bank," he said dryly. "I own it."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 In the afternoon, when Mallory stopped by to see Alex Harrison, there was an attractive woman with him. She was in her early thirties, blond and trim, and ele\-gant-looking.
 She was wearing an Adolfo dress that Mallory figured must have cost more than his monthly salary.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ah! Here's our hero," Alex Harrison said. "It's Dr. Mallory, isn't it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. Ken Mallory."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Mallory, this is my daughter, Lauren."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She held out a slim, manicured hand. "Father tells me you saved his life."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He smiled. "That's what doctors are for."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lauren was looking over him approvingly. "Not all doctors."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was obvious to Mallory that these two did not belong in a county hospital. He said to Alex Harrison, "You're coming along fine, but perhaps you'd feel more comfortable if you called your own doctor.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alex Harrison shook his head. ' 'That won't be neces\-sary. He didn't save my life. You did. Do you like it here?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was a strange question. "It's interesting, yes. Why?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Harrison sat up in bed. "Well, I was just thinking. A good-looking fellow as capable as you are could have a damned bright future. I don't think you have much of a future in a place like this."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, I ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Maybe it was fate that brought me here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lauren spoke up. "I think what my father is trying to say is that he would like to show you his appreciation."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Lauren is right. You and I should have a serious talk when I get out of here. I'd like you to come up to the house for dinner.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory looked at Lauren and said slowly, "I'd like that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And it changed his life.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ken Mallory was having a surprisingly difficult time getting together with Kat. "How's Monday night, Kat?" "Wonderful." "Good. I'll pick you up at\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wait! I just remembered. A cousin from New York is coming to town for the night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, Tuesday?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm on call Tuesday."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What about Wednesday?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I promised Paige and Honey that we'd do something together Wednesday."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was getting desperate. His time was running out too fast.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thursday?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thursday is fine."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Great. Shall I pick you up?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. Why don't we meet at Chez Panisse?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Very well. Eight o'clock?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory waited at the restaurant until nine o'clock and then telephoned Kat. There was no answer. He waited another half hour. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Maybe she misunderstood, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She wouldn't deliberately break a date with me.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following morning, he saw Kat at the hospital. She ran up to him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, Ken, I'm so sorry! It was the silliest thing. I decided to take a little nap before our date. I fell asleep and when I woke up it was the middle of the night. Poor darling. Did you wait for me long?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, no. It's all right." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The stupid womanl }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He moved closer to her. "I want to finish what we started, baby. I go crazy when I think about you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Me, too," Kat said. "I can't wait."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Maybe next weekend we can ..." "Oh, dear. I'm busy over the weekend." And so it went. The clock was running.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was reporting events to Paige when her beeper went off.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Excuse me." Kat picked up a telephone. "Dr. Hunter." She listened a moment. "Thanks. I'll be right there." She replaced the receiver. "I have to go. Emer\-gency."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sighed. "What else is new?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Kat strode down the corridor and took an elevator down to the emergency room. Inside were two dozen cots, all of them occupied. Kat thought of it as the suffering room, filled day and night with victims of automobile accidents, gunshots or k
nife wounds, and twisted limbs. A kaleidoscope of broken lives. To Kat it was a small corner of hell.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 An orderly hurried up to her. "Dr. Hunter ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What have we got?" Kat asked. They were moving toward a cot at the far end of the room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's unconscious. It looks as though someone beat him up. His face and head are battered, he has a broken nose, a dislocated shoulder blade, at least two different fractures to his right arm, and ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Why did you call me?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The paramedics think there's a head injury. There could be brain damage."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They had reached the cot where the victim lay. His face was caked with blood, swollen and bruised. He was wearing alligator shoes and . . . Kat's heart skipped a beat. She leaned forward and took a closer look. I
t was Lou Dinetto.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat ran skillful fingers over his scalp and examined his eyes. There was a definite concussion.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She hurried over to a telephone and dialed. "This is Dr. Hunter. I want a head CAT scan done. The patient's name is Dinetto. Lou Dinetto. Send down a gurney, stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat replaced the receiver and turned her attention back to Dinetto. She said to the orderly, "Stay with him. When the gurney arrives, take him to the third floor. I'll be waiting."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Thirty minutes later on the third floor, Kat was study\-
ing the CAT scan she had ordered. "He has some brain hemorrhaging, he has a high fever, and he's in shock. I want him stabilized for twenty-four hours. I'll decide then when we'll operate."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat wondered whether what had happened to Dinetto might affect Mike.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And how.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige stopped by to see Jimmy. He was feeling much better.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did you hear about the flasher in the garment dis\-trict? He walked up to a little old lady and opened up his raincoat. She studied him a moment and said, 'You call }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 that }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was having dinner with Mallory at an intimate little restaurant near the bay. Seated across from Mal\-lory, studying him, Kat felt guilty. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I should never have started this, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 know what he is, and yet I'm having a wonderful time. Damn the man! But I can't stop our plan now. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
They had finished their coffee.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat leaned forward. "Can we go to your place, Ken?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You bet!" }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Finally, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat shifted in her chair uncomfortably and frowned. "Uh, oh!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you all right?" Mallory asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Certainly." He watched her get up and head for the ladies' room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When she returned, she said, "It's bad timing, dar\-ling. I'm so sorry. You'd better get me home."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He stared at her, trying to conceal his frustration. The damned fates were conspiring against him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was going to lose a precious five days.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Five minutes after Kat returned to the apartment, the front doorbell rang. Kat smiled to herself. Mallory had found an excuse to come back, and she hated herself for being so pleased. She walked over to the door and opened it.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Now mind you," he said, "minimal anesthetic. The brain has no feeling, so once you get in there, you won't need much."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm aware of that," Kat said patiently.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You were scheduled to do an operation later, but your patient has started to hemorrhage. They're taking him to OR Three now. It doesn't look as though he's going to make it. You'll have to operate right away."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Who?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A Mr. Dinetto."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat looked at him aghast. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dinetto?" If Mr. Dinetto dies, you and your fucking family are gonna be wiped out.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat hurried down the corridor that led to OR Three. Approaching her were Rhino and the Shadow.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's going on?" Rhino demanded.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat's mouth was so dry that it was difficult to speak. "Mr. Dinetto started hemorrhaging. We must operate right away."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The Shadow grabbed her arm. "Then do it! But re\-member what we told you. Keep him alive." Kat pulled away and hurried into the operating room.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Because of the change in schedule, Dr. Vance was doing the operation with Kat. He was a good surgeon. Kat began the ritual scrub: a half minute on each arm first, then a half minute on each hand. She repeated it an
d then scrubbed her nails.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Vance stepped in beside her and started his scrub. ''How are you feeling?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Fine," Kat lied.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lou Dinetto was wheeled into the operating room on a gurney, semiconscious, and carefully transferred to the operating table. His s
haven head was scrubbed and painted with Merthiolate solution that gleamed a bright orange under the operating lights. He was as pale as death.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The team was in place: Dr. Vance, another resident, an anesthesiologist, two scrub nurses, and a circulating nurse. Kat checked to make sure that everything they might require was there. She glanced at the wall moni\-tors
\emdash oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide, temperature, muscle stimulators, precordial stethoscope, EKG, auto\-matic blood pressure, and disconnect alarms. Every\-thing was in order.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The anesthesiologist strapped a blood pressure cuff on Dinetto's right arm, then placed a rubber mask over the patient's face. "All right, now. Breathe deeply. Take three big breaths."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dinetto was asleep before the third breath. The procedure began.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Kat was reporting aloud. "There's an area of damage in the middle of the brain, caused by a clot that's broken off the aorta valve. It's blocking a small blood vessel on the right side of the brain and extending slightly into the lef
t half." She probed deeper. "It's at the lower edge of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Scalpel."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A tiny burr hole about the size of a dime was made by an electric drill to expose the dura mater. Next, Kat cut open the dura to expose a segment of the cerebral cortex that lay underneath. "Forceps!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The scrub nurse handed her the electric forceps.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The incision was held open by a small retractor which maintained itself in place.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's a hell of a lot of bleeding," Vance said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat picked up the bovie and started to cauterize the bleeders. "We're going to control it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Vance started suction on soft cotton patties that were placed on the dura. The oozing veins on the surface of the dura were identified and coagulated.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It looks good," Vance said. "He's going to make it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat breathed a sigh of relief.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And at that instant, Lou Dinetto stiffened and hi? body went into spasm. The anesthesiologist called out, "Blood pressure's dropping!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat said, "Get some more blood into him!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They were all looking at the monitor. The curve was rapidly flattening out. There were two quick heartbeat* followed by ventricular fibrillation.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

Kat was doing this to him deliberately! She had somehow gotten wind of the bet, and had decided to make a fool of him, to play a joke on him, a joke that was going to cost him ten thousand dollars that he didn't have. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189

Two hours later, on her way back to the apartment, Kat was filled with a glorious sense of well-being. She had been nervous about making love, afraid that she would hate it after the terrible experience she had had, but instead, Ken Mallory had tur
ned it into something wonderful. He had unlocked emotions in her that she had never known existed.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Smiling to herself at the thought of how they had outwitted the doctors at the last moment and won the bet, Kat opened the door to the apartment and stood t

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought of her father. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He would have been a big success on Park Avenue, but he wasn't interested in money. His only interest was in helping people.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I've already divorced Karen, so we can get married right away." He patted her hand. "What do you think of the idea of living in New York?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige took a deep breath. "Alfred ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was an expectant smile on his face. "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Get out."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The smile slowly faded. "What?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige rose. "I want you to get out of here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was confused. "Where do you want me to go?" "I won't tell you," Paige said. "It would hurt your feelings."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 After Alfred had gone, Paige sat lost in thought. Kat had been right. She had been clinging to a ghost. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Help\-
ing those ignorant savages, when I could have been making a bundle over here. . . . Five hundred thousand a year!
\par And that's what I've been hanging on to, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought wonderingly. She should have felt depressed, but instead she was filled with a feeling of elation. She suddenly felt free. She knew now what she wanted.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She walked over to the telephone and dialed Jason's number.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hello."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Jason, it's Paige. Remember telling me about your house in Noe Valley?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'd love to see it. Are you free tonight?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason said quietly, "Do you want to tell me what's going on, Paige? I'm very confused."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm the one who's confused. I thought I was in love with a man I knew a long time ago, but he's not the same man. I know what I want now."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I want to see your house."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Noe Valley belonged to another century. It was a colorful oasis in the heart of one of the most cosmopoli\-tan cities in the world.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason's house was a reflection of him\emdash 
comfortable, neat, and charming. He escorted Paige through the house. "This is the living room, the kitchen, the guest bathroom, the study . . ."He looked at her and said, "The bedroom is upstairs. Would you like to see it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said quietly, "Very much."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They went up the stairs into the bedroom. Paige's heart was pounding wildly. But what was happening seemed inevitable. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
should have known from the begin\-ning, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought.
\par 
\par Paige never knew who made the first move, but some\-
how they were in each other's arms and Jason's lips were on hers, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world. They started to undress each other, and there was a fierce urgency in both of them. And then they were in bed, and he was making
 love to her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "God," he whispered. "I love you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know," Paige teased. "Ever since I told you to put on the white coat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 After they made love, Paige said, "I'd like to spend the night here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason smiled. "You won't hate me in the morning?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I promise."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige spent the night with Jason, talking . . . making love . . . talking. In the morning, she cooked breakfast for him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason watched her, and said, "I don't know how I got so lucky, but thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm the lucky one," Paige told him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You know something? I never got an answer to my proposal."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You, too. You know something? You're a real stand-up broad. I'm going to tell you something I want you to remember. If you ever need a favor\emdash }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 anything\emdash  }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She knew that he meant it. And she knew that she would never go to him.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 During the weeks that followed, Paige and Jason spoke on the phone three and four times a day, and were together every time Paige was not on night call.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The hospital was busier than ever. Paige had been on a thirty-six-hour shift that had been filled with emei-gencies. She had just gone to sleep in the on-call room when she was awakened by the urgent shrill of the telephone.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She fumbled the phone to her ear. "H'lo?" "Dr. Taylor, will you come to Room 422, stat?" Paige tried to clear her mind. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Room 422. One of Dr Barker's patients. Lance Kelly. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
He had just had a mitral valve replaced. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Something must have gone wrong. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paigfc stumbled off the cot and walked ou
t into the deserted corridor. She decided not to wait for the elevator. She ran up the stairs. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Maybe it's just a nervous nurse. If it's serious, I'll call Dr. Barker, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She walked into Room 422 and stood in the doorway, staring. The patient was fighting for breath and moan\-ing. The nurse turned to Paige in obvious relief. "I didn't know what to do, doctor. I . . ."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige hurried to the bedside. "You're going to be fine," she said reassuringly. She took his wrist between two fingers. His pulse was jumping wildly. The mitral valve was malfunctioning.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let's sedate him," Paige ordered.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The nurse handed Paige a syringe, and Paige injected it into a vein. Paige turned to the nurse. "Tell the head nurse to get an operating team together, stat. And send for Dr. Barker!"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Fifteen minutes later, Kelly was on the operating table. The team consisted of two scrub nurses, a circulat\-ing nurse, and two residents. A television monitor was perched high in a corner of the r
oom to display the heart rate, EKG, and blood pressure.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The anesthesiologist walked in, and Paige felt like cursing. Most of the anesthesiologists at the hospital were skilled doctors, but Herman Koch was an excep\-tion. Paige had worked with him before an
d tried to avoid him as much as possible. She did not trust him. Now she had no choice.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige watched him secure a tube to the patient's throat, while she unfolded a paper drape with a clear window and placed it over the patient's chest.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Put a line into the jugular vein," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Koch nodded. "Right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One of the residents asked, "What's the problem here?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Barker replaced the mitral valve yesterday. I think it's ruptured." Paige looked over at Dr. Koch. "Is he out?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Koch nodded. "Sleeping like he's in bed at home." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I wish you were, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. "What are you us\-ing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Propofol."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She nodded. "All right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She watched Kelly being connected to the heart-lung machine so she could perform a cardiopulmonary by\-pass. Paige studied the monitors on the wal
l. Pulse 140 ... blood oxygen saturation 92 percent. . . blood pressure 80 over 60. "Let's go," Paige said. One of the residents put on music. Paige stepped up to the operating table under eleven hundred watts of hot white light and turned to the scrub nu
rse. "Scalpel, please ..." The operation began.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige removed all the sternal wires from the operation the day before. She then cut from the base of the neck to the lower end of the sternum, while one of the residents blotted away the blood with gauze pads.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She carefully went through the layers of fat and mus\-
cle, and in front of her was the erratically beating heart. "There's the problem," Paige said. "The atrium is perforated. Blood is collecting around the heart and compressing it." Paige was looking at
 the monitor on the wall. The pump pressure had dropped dangerously. "Increase the flow," Paige ordered. The door to the operating room opened and Lawrence Barker stepped in. He stood to one side, watching what was happening.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said, "Dr. Barker. Do you want to . . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's your operation."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige took a quick look at what Koch was doing. "Be careful. You'll overanesthetize him, dammit! Slow it down!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But I . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's in V-tach! His pressure is dropping!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What do you want me to do?" Koch asked help\-lessly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He should know, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought angrily. "Give him lidocaine and epinephrine! Now!" She was yelling.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige watched as Koch picked up a syringe and in\-jected it into the patient's IV.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A resident looked at the monitor and called out, "Blood pressure is falling."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was working frantically to stop the flow of blood. She looked up at Koch. "Too much flow! I told you to . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The noise of the heartbeat on the monitor suddenly became chaotic.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "My God! Something's gone wrong!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Give me the defibrillator!" Paige yelled.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The circulating nurse reached for the defibrillator on the crash cart, opened two sterile paddles, and plugged them in. She turned the buttons up to charge them and ten seconds later handed them to Paige.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She took the paddles and positioned them directly over Kelly's heart. Kelly's body jumped, then fell back.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige tried again, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 willing }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 him to come back to life, willing him to breathe again. Nothing. The heart lay still, a dead, useless organ.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was in a fury. Her part of the operation had been successful. Koch had overanesthetized the patient.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Paige was applying the defibrillator to Lanct Kelly's body for the third futile time, Dr. Barker stepped up to the operating table and turned to Paige. "You killed him."

Paige walked through the corridors of the hospital, knowing that she was seeing them for the last time. There were the familiar noises and the people hurrying up and down the corridors. It had become more of a home to her than she'd realized.
 She thought of Jimmy and Chang, and all the wonderful doctors she had worked with. Darling Jason going on rounds with her in his white coat. She passed the cafeteria where she and Honey and Kat had had a hundred breakfasts, and the lounge, where they had
 tried to have a party. The corridors and rooms were full of so many memories. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to miss it, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, I must say, your telephone call surprised me, Paige! Have you definitely made up your mind?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I want to see him." All of Paige's pent-up anger boiled to the surface.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker was examining some slides under a micro\-scope when Paige entered. He looked up. "I'm told you've decided to quit the hospital."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You've wanted me out of here from the first moment you saw me. Well, you've won. I can't fight you any\-more. When you told me I killed your patient, I . . ." Paige's voice broke. "I . . .1 think you're a sadistic, cold-hearted
 son of a bitch, and I hate you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sit down," Dr. Barker said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par He suddenly stopped and began to gasp.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Paige watched in horror, he clutched his heart and toppled over in his chair, his face twisted to one side in a horrible rictus.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was at his side instantly. "Dr. Barker!" She grabbed the telephone and shouted into it, "Code Red! Code Red!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It's my fault, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I wanted him dead. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She felt miserable.

His chart read, "John Cronin, white male, age 70. Diagnosis: Cardiac tumor." Paige had not yet met John Cronin. He was scheduled to have heart surgery. She walked into his room, a nurse and a staff 
doctor at her side. She smiled warmly and said, "Good morning, Mr. Cronin."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They had just extubated him, and there were the marks of adhesive tape around his mouth. IV bottles hung overhead, and the tubing had been inserted in his left arm.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's smile died. "I'm a cardiovascular surgeon. I'm going to do everything I can to get you well again."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 going to operate on my heart?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's right. I ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 John Cronin looked at the resident and said, "For Christ's sake, is this the best this hospital can do?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I assure you, Dr. Taylor is thoroughly qualified," the staff doctor said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "So is my ass."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said stiffly, "Would you rather bring in your own surgeon?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't have one. I can't afford those high-priced quacks. You doctors are all alike. All you're interested in is money. You don't give a damn about people. We're just pieces of meat to you, aren't we?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was fighting to control her temper. "I know you're upset right now, but\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Upset? Just because you're going to cut my heart out?" He was screaming. "I know I'll die on the op\-erating table. You're going to kill me, and I hope they get you for murder!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's enough!" Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was grinning at her maliciously. "It wouldn't look good on your record if I died, would it, doctor? Maybe I }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 will }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 let you operate on me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige found that she was hyperventilating. She turned to the nurse. "I want an EKG and a chemistry panel." She took one last look at John Cronin, then turned and left the room.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige returned an hour later with the reports on the tests, John Cronin looked up. "Oh, the bitch is back."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige operated on John Cronin at six o'clock the following morning.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The moment she opened him up, she knew that there was no hope. The major problem was not the heart. Cronin's organs showed signs of melanoma.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A resident said, "Oh, my God! What are we going to do?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We're going to pray that he doesn't have to live with this too long."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige stepped o
ut of the operating room into the corridor, she found a woman and two men waiting for her. The woman was in her late thirties. She had bright red hair and too much makeup, and she wore a heavy, cheap perfume. She had on a tight dress that accentuated a vo
luptuous figure. The men were in their forties, and both had red hair. To Paige, they looked like a circus troupe.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The woman said to Paige, "You Dr. Taylor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm Mrs. Cronin. These are my brothers. How's my husband?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige hesitated. She said carefully, "The operation went as well as could be expected."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, thank God!" Mrs. Cronin said melodramati\-cally, dabbing at her eyes with a lace handkerchief. "I'd die if anything happened to John!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige felt as if she were watching an actress in a bad play.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Can I see my darling now?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Not yet, Mrs. Cronin. He's in the recovery room. I suggest that you come back tomorrow."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll be back." She turned to the men. "Come along, fellas."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige watched as they walked away. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Poor John Cro\-nin, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was given the report the next morning. The cancer had metastasized throughout Cronin's body. It was too late for radiation treatment.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The oncologist said to Paige, "There's nothing to do but try to keep him comfortable. He's going to be in a hell of a lot of pain."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How much time does he have?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "A week or two at the most."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige went to visit John Cronin in intensive care. He was asleep. John Cronin was no longer a bitter, vitriolic man, but a human being fighting desperately for his life. He was on a respirator, and being fed intrave\-
nously. Paige sat down at his bedside, watching him. He looked tired and defeated. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He's one of the unlucky ones, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Even with all the modern medical miracles, there's nothing we can do to save him. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige touched his arm gently. After a while, she left.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Later that afternoon, Paige stopped by to see John Cronin again. He was off the respirator now. When he opened his eyes and saw Paige, he said drowsily, "The operation's over, huh?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige smiled reassuringly. "Yes. I just came by to make sure that you're comfortable."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Comfortable?" he snorted. "What the hell do you care?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said, "Please. Let's not fight."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Cronin lay there, silently studying her. "The other doctor told me you did a good job."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige said nothing.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I have cancer, don't I?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How bad is it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The question posed a dilemma that all surgeons were faced with sooner or later. Paige said, "It's pretty bad.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a long silence. "What about radiation or chemotherapy?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry. It would make you feel worse, and it wouldn't help."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I see. Well . . . I've had a good life."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sure you have."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You may not think so, looking at me now, but I've had a lot of women."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I believe it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yeah. Women . . . thick steaks . . . good cigars .. . You married?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You ought to be. Everyone should be married. I've been married. Twice. First, for thirty-five years. She was a wonderful lady. She died of a heart attack."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's okay." He sighed. "Then I got sucked into marrying a bimbo. Her and her two hungry brothers. It's my fault for being so horny, I guess. Her red hair turned me on. She's some piece of work."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sure she ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No offense, but do you know why I'm in t
his cockamamie hospital? My wife put me here. She didn't want to waste money on me for a private hospital. This way there'll be more to leave to her and her brothers." He looked up at Paige. "How much time }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 do }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I have left?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You said you've had a good life."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I did. It's kinda funny, knowing it's about over. Where do you think we go?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't know."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He forced a smile. "I'll let you know when I get there."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Some medication is on the way. Can I do anything to make you more comfortable?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yeah. Come back and talk to me tonight."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was Paige's night off, and she was exhausted. "I'll come back."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That night when Paige went back to see John Cronin, he was awake.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He winced. "Terrible. I was never very good about pain. I guess I've got a low threshold."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I understand."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hazel?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "My wife. The bimbo. She and her brothers were here to see me. They said they talked to you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She's something, ain't she? I sure got myself into a bundle of trouble there. They can't wait for me to kick the bucket."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't say that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's true. The only reason Hazel married me was for my money. To tell you the truth, I didn't mind that so much. I
 really had a good time with her in bed, but then she and her brothers started to get greedy. They always wanted more."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The two of them sat there in a comfortable silence.

he believed even more firmly that she was on his side. The odds against a man as wealthy as Alex Harrison being brought to Embarcadero County Hospital were enormous. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
And I'm the one who saved his life, and he wants to show his gratitude, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory thought gl
eefully. He had asked a friend of his about the Harrisons. "Rich doesn't even begin to cover it," his friend had said. "He's a millionaire a dozen times over. And he has a great-looking daughter. She's been married three or four times. The last time to a 
count." "Have you ever met the Harrisons?" "No. They don't mingle with the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 hoi polloi." }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
On a Saturday morning, as Alex Harrison was being discharged from the hospital, he said, "Ken, do you think I'll be in shape to give a dinner party a week from now?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
\par Mallory nodded. "If you don't overdo it, I don't see why not."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alex Harrison smiled. "Fine. You're the guest of honor.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory felt a sudden thrill. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The old man really meant what he said. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well . . . thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Lauren and I will expect you at seven-thirty next Saturday night." He gave Mallory an address on Nob, Hill.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll be there," Mallory said. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Will I ever! }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory had promised to take Kat to the theater that evening, but it would be easy to cancel. He had collected his winnings, and he enjoyed having sex with her. Sev\-
eral times a week they had managed to get together in one of the empty on-call rooms, or a deserted hospital room, or at her apartment or his. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Her fires were banked a long time, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Mallory thought happily, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 but when the explosion came}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 \emdash }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 wow! Well, one of these days, it will be time to say arrivederci.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 On the day he was to have dinner with the Harrisons, Mallory telephoned Kat. "Bad news, baby."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's the matter, darling?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "One of the doctors is sick and they've asked me to cover for him. I'm afraid I'm going to have to break our date."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She did not want to let him know how disappointed she was, how much she needed to be with him. Kat said lightly, "Oh well, that's the doctor business, isn't it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yeah. I'll make it up to you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You don't have to make anything up to me," she said warmly. "I love you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I love you, too."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ken, when are we going to talk about us?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What do you mean?" He knew exactly what she meant. A commitment. They were all alike. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They use their pussies for bait, hoping to hook a sucker into spending his life with them. }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Well, he was too smart for that. When the time came, he would regretfully bow out, as he had done a dozen times before.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was saying, "Don't you think we should set a date, Ken? I have a lot of plans to make."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, sure. We'll do that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I thought maybe June. What do you think?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 You don't want to know what I think. If I play my cards right, there's going to be a wedding, but it won't be with you. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We'll talk about it, baby. I really have to go now."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The Harrisons' home was a mansion out of a motion picture, situated on acres of manicured grounds. The house itself seemed to go on forever. There were two dozen guests, and in the huge drawing roo
m a small orchestra was playing. When Mallory walked in, Lauren hurried over to greet him. She was wearing a silky clinging gown. She squeezed Mallory's hand, "Wel\-come, guest of honor. I'm so glad you're here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "So am I. How is your father?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Very much alive, thanks to you. You're quite a hero in this house."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory smiled modestly. "I only did my job."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I suppose that's what God says every day." She took his hand and began introducing him to the other guests.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The guest list was blue-ribbon. The governor of Cali\-
fornia was there, the French ambassador, a justice of the Supreme Court, and a dozen assorted politicians, artists, and business tycoons. Mallory could feel the power in the room, and it thrilled him. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This is where I belong, }
{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Right here, with these people.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The dinner was delicious and elegantly served. At the end of the evening, when the guests started to leave, Harrison said to Mallory, "Don't rush off, Ken. I'd like to talk to you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'd be delighted."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Harrison, Lauren, and Mallory sat in the library. Har\-rison was seated in a chair next to his daughter.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "When I told you at the hospital that I thought you had a great future before you, I meant it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I really appreciate your confidence, sir."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You should be in private practice."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory laughed self-deprecatingly. "I'm afraid it's not that easy, Mr. Harrison. It takes a long time to build up a practice, and I'm ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ordinarily, yes. But you're not an ordinary man."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't understand."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "After you finish your residency, Father wants to set you up in your own practice," Lauren said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 For a moment, Mallory was speechless. It was too easy. He felt as though he were living in some kind of wonderful dream. "I ... I don't know what to say."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I have a lot of very wealthy friends. I've already spoken to some of them about you. I can promise you that you'll be swamped the minute you put up your shingle."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Daddy, lawyers put up shingles," Lauren said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Whatever. In any case, I'd like to finance you. Are you interested?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was finding it difficult to breathe. "Very much so. But I ... I don't know when I would be able to repay you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You don't understand. I'm repaying }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 you. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 You won't owe me anything."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lauren was looking at Mallory, her eyes warm. "Please say yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'd be stupid to say no, wouldn't I?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's right," Lauren said softly. "And I'm sure you're not stupid."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 On his way home, Ken Mallory was in a state of euphoria. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This is as good as it gets, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. But he was wrong. It got better.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lauren telephoned him. "I hope you don't mind mix\-ing business with pleasure."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He smiled to himself. "Not at all. What did you have in mind?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's a charity ball next Saturday night. Would you like to take me?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Oh, baby, I'm going to take you all right. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'd love to." He was on duty Saturday night, but he would call in sick and they would have to find someone to take his place.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was a man who believed in planning ahead, but what was happening to him now went beyond his wildest dreams.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Over the next few weeks he was swept up in Lauren's social circle, and life took on a dizzying pace. He would be out with Lauren dancing half the night, and stumble through his days at the hospital. There were mounting complaints about his work, but he di
dn't care. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'll}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 be out of here soon, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he told himself.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The thought of getting away from the dreary county hospital and having his own practice was exciting enough, but Lauren was the bonus that Lady Luck had given him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was becoming a nuisance. Mallory 
had to keep finding pretexts to avoid seeing her. When she would press him, he would say, "Darling, I'm crazy about you ... of course I want to marry you, but right now, I ..." and he would go into a litany of excuses.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was Lauren who suggested that the two of them spend a weekend at the family lodge at Big Sur. Mallory was elated. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Everything is coming up roses, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm going to own the whole damned world!
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The lodge was spread across pine-covered hills, an enormous structure built of wood and ti
le and stone, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It had a master bedroom, eight guest bedrooms, a spacious living room with a stone fireplace, an indoor swimming pool, and a large hot tub. Everything smelled of old money.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When they walked in, Lauren turned to Mallory and said, "I let the servants go for the weekend."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory grinned. "Good thinking." He put his arms around Lauren and said softly, "I'm wild about you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Show me," Lauren said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They spent the day in bed, and Lauren was almost as insatiable as Kat.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're wearing me out!" Mallory laughed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good. I don't want you to be able to make love to anyone else." She sat up in bed. "There }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 is }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 no one else, is there, Ken?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Absolutely not," Mallory said sincerely. "There's no one in the world for me but you. I'
m in love with you, Lauren." Now was the time to take the plunge, to wrap his whole future up in one neat package. It would be one thing to be a successful doctor in private practice. It would be something else to be Alex Har\-
rison's son-in-law. "I want to marry you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He held his breath, waiting for her answer.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, yes, darling," Lauren said. "Yes."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At the apartment, Kat was frantically trying to reach Mallory. She telephoned the hospital.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sorry, Dr. Hunter, Dr. Mallory is not on call, and doesn't answer his page."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Didn't he leave word where he could be reached?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We have no record of it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat replaced the receiver and turned to Paige. "Something's happened to him, I know it. He would have called me by now."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Kat, there could be a hundred reasons why you haven't heard from him. Perhaps he had to go out of town suddenly, or . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're right. I'm sure there's some good excuse."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat looked at the phone and }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 willed }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 it to ring.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Mallory returned to San Francisco, he tele\-phoned Kat at the hospital.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Hunter is off duty," the receptionist told him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 ''Thank you.'' Mallory called the apartment. Kat was there.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hi, baby!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ken! Where have you been? I've been worried about you. I tried everywhere to reach\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I had a family emergency," he said smoothly. "I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to call you. I had to go out of town. May I come over?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You know you may. I'm so glad you're all right. I\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Half an hour.'' He replaced the receiver and thought happily, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The time has come, the walrus said, to speak of many things. Kat, baby, it was great fun, but it was just one of those things.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Mallory arrived at the apartment, Kat threw her arms around him. "I've missed you!" She could not tell hi
m how desperately worried she had been. Men hated that kind of thing. She stood back. "Darling, you look absolutely exhausted."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory sighed. "I've been up for the last twenty-four hours." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That part is true, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat hugged him. "Poor baby. Can I fix something for you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, I'm fine. All I really need is a good night's sleep. Let's sit down, Kat. We have to have a talk." He sat on the couch next to her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Is anything wrong?" Kat asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory took a deep breath. "Kat, I've been thinking a lot about us lately."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She smiled. "So have I. I have news for you. I\emdash }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, wait. Let me finish. Kat, I think we're rushing into things too fast. I ... I think I proposed too hast\-ily."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She paled. "What . . . what are you saying?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

at the San Francisco Opera House and enjoying every minute of it. He was seated in a box with Lauren Harrison and her father. In the lobby of the opera house during intermission, Alex Har\-

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Sean fixed his black eyes on her. "They can cut out anything they want except my heart. That belongs to you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Honey had a few minutes to spare, she would drop by and chat with Sean. He was charming and amusing.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's worth bein' operated on just to have you around, little darlin'."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You aren't nervous about the operation, are you?" she asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I think you're beautiful," Sean said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 No one had ever told Honey that before. She found herself blushing. "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was ridiculous Irish blarney, and yet ...}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That afternoon when Honey went in to see Sean, she said, "How are you feeling?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No," Honey said. She was lying.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I was hoping after my operation, I could take you out. You're not engaged, or married, or anything silly like that, are you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey smiled. "Nothing silly like that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A lot of women, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Honey went to Sean's room the following morning, he said, "I have a little present for you." He handed her a sheet of drawing paper. On it was a soft\-ened, idealized sketch of Honey.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I love it!" Honey said. "You're a wonderful art\-ist!" And she suddenly remembered the psychic's words: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 You're going to fall in love. He's an artist. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She was looking at Sean strangely.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey said, "Do you remember telling me that I was going to fall in love with someone\emdash an artist?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There are some tarot cards in that drawer over there. Could you give them to me, please?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As Honey handed her the cards, she thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 This is ridiculous! I don't believe in this!}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Frances Gordon was laying out the cards. She kept nodding to herself, and nodding and smiling, and sud\-denly she stopped. Her face went pale. "Oh, my God!" She looked up at Honey.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What . . . what's the matter?" Honey asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Frances Gordon's voice was filled with sadness. "The poor man." She looked up at Honey. "I'm sorry . . . I'm so sorry."

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Where do you want these?" the driver asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right." The driver put the bags down and pulled out a form. "I need your John Hancock."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

ble people doing their jobs.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 9:05 }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a.m. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Dr. Radnor reached the cystic duct. A textbook operation up until then. As he started to excise the gallbladder, his hand slipped and the scalpel nicked an artery. Blood began to pour out.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Jesus!" He tried to stop the flow.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

n't go away," Foster told Andrea. He walked past the fax machine, which had stopped clicking, and picked up the telephone. "Blood supply."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We need four units of Type O in OR Two, stat."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Right." Foster replaced the receiver and went to the corner where th
e new blood had been deposited. He pulled out four bags and placed them on the top shelf of the metal cart used for such emergencies. He double-checked the bags. "Type O," he said aloud. He rang for an orderly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's going on?" Andrea asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Foster looked at the schedule in front of him. "It looks like one of the patients is giving Dr. Radnor a bad time."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks," she said. She carried the bags into the room. "It's here, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 As he started toward his desk, he passed the fax machine. He pulled out the fax. It read:

ing repeatedly reactive for Antibody HIV Type I were distributed.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He stared at it a moment, then walked over to his desk and picked up the invoice he had signed for the bags of blood that had just been delivered. He looked at the number on the invoice. The number on the warn\-
ing was identical.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, my God!" he said. He grabbed the telephone. "Get me OR Two, fast!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A nurse answered.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We won't know whether you're HIV-positive for six or eight weeks. And even if you are, that does not necessarily mean you will get AIDS. We're going to do everything we can for you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What the hell can you do for me that you haven't already done?" Sean said bitterly. "I'm a dead man."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Honey heard the news, she was devastated. She remembered Frances Gordon's words. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The poor man.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I. . . I wish I could, but I have a busy day scheduled at the hospital." His mind was racing. "Lauren, do you think it's a good idea to do an interview now? I mean, shouldn't we wait until . . . ?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lauren laughed. "You don't know the press, darling. They're like bloodhounds. No, it's much better to get it over with now."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Monday!
\par 
\par  }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The following morning, Mallory tracked down Kat in a utility room. She looked tired and haggard. She had no makeup on and her hair was uncurled. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lauren would never let herself go like that, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory thought.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hi, honey!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat did not answer.
\par Mallory took her
 in his arms. "I've been thinking a lot about us, Kat. I didn't sleep at all last night. There's no one else for me. You were right, and I was wrong. I guess the news came as kind of a shock to me. I want you to have our baby." He watched the sudden glow 
on Kat's face.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you really mean that, Ken?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You bet I do."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She put her arms around him. "Thank God! Oh, darling. I was so worried. I don't know what I would do without you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You don't have to worry about that. From now on, everything is going to be wonderful.'' }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 You'll never knew how wonderful. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Look, I have Sunday night off. Are you free?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She grasped his hand. "I'll make myself free."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Great! We'll have a nice quiet dinner and then we'll go back to your place for a nightcap. Do you think you can get rid of Paige and Honey? I want us to be alone."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat smiled. "No problem. You don't know how happy you've made me. Did I ever tell you how much I love you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I love you, too. I'll show you how much Sunday night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Thinking it over, Mallory decided it was a foolproof plan. He had worked it out to the smallest detail. There was no way Kat's death could ever be blamed on him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was too risky to get what he needed from the hospi\-tal pharmacy because security had been tightened there after the Bowman affair. Instead, early Sunday morn\-
ing, Mallory went looking for a pharmacy far away from the neighborhood where he lived. Most of them were closed on Sunday, and he went to half a dozen before he found one that was open.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The pharmacist behind the counter said, "Morning. Can I help you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. I'm going to see a patient in this area, and I want to take a prescription to him." He pulled out his" prescription pad and wrote on it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The pharmacist smiled. "Not many doctors make house calls these days."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know. It's a pity, isn't it? People just don't care anymore." He handed the slip of paper to the pharma\-cist.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The pharmacist looked at it and nodded. "This will only take a few minutes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Step one.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That afternoon, Mallory made a stop at the hospital. He was there no more than ten minutes, and when he left, he was carrying a small package.
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Step two.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory had arranged to meet Kat at Trader Vic's for dinner, and he was waiting for her when she arrived. He watched her walking toward the table and thought, 
\par 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It's the Last Supper, bitch.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He rose and gave her a warm smile. "Hello, doll. You look beautiful." And he had to admit that she did. She looked sensational. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She could have been a model. And she's great in bed. All she lacks, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ken thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 is about twenty million dollars, give or take a few million.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat was aware again of how the other women in the restaurant were eyeing Ken, envying her. But he only had eyes for her. He was the old Ken, warm and atten\-tive.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How was your day?" Ken asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She sighed. "Busy. Three operations in the morning and two this afternoon." She leaned forward. "I know it's too early, but I swear I could feel the baby kicking when I was getting dressed."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory smiled. "Maybe it wants to get out."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We should do an ultrasound test and find out if it's a boy or a girl. Then I can start buying clothes for it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Great idea."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ken, can we set a wedding date? I'd like to have our wedding as soon as possible."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No problem," Mallory said easily. "We can apply for a license next week."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's wonderful!" She had a sudden thought. ' 'Maybe we could get a few days off and go somewhere on our honeymoon. Somewhere not too far away\emdash up to Oregon or Washington."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Wrong, baby. I'll be honeymooning in June, on my yacht on the French Riviera.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That sounds great. I'll talk to Wallace."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat squeezed his hand. "Thank you," she said husk\-ily. "I'm going to make you the best wife in the whole world."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm sure of it." Mallory smiled. "Now eat your vegetables. We want the baby to be healthy, don't we?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They left the restaurant at 9:00 }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 p.m. As }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 they ap\-proached Kat's apartment building, Mallory said, "Are you sure Paige and Honey won't be home?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I made sure," Kat said. "Paige is at the hospital, on call, and I told Honey you and I wanted to be alone here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She saw the expression on his face. "Is anything wrong?''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, baby. I told you, I just like our private times to be private." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'll}{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189  }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 have to be careful, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. }{
\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Very careful. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Let's hurry."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 His impatience warmed Kat.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Inside the apartment, Mallory said, "Let's go into the bedroom."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kat grinned. "That sounds like a great idea."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory watched Kat undress, and he thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She still has a great figure. A baby would ruin it.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Aren't you going to get undressed, Ken?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Of course.'' He remembered the time she had gotten him to undress and then walked out on him. Well, now she was going to pay for that.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He took his clothes off slowly. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Can I perform! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he wondered. He was almost trembling with nervousness. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
What I'm going to do is her fault. Not mine. I gave her a chance to back out and she was too stupid to take it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He slipped into bed beside her and felt her warm body against his. They began to stroke each other, and he felt himself getting aroused. He entered her and she began to moan.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, darling ... it feels so wonderful ..." She began to move faster and faster. "Yes . . . yes . . . oh, my God! . . . don't stop ..." And her body began to jerk spasmodically, and she shuddered and then lay still in his arms.}
{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory walked over to the little bar and poured scotch into two glasses. He glanced toward the bedroom to make sure he could not be seen,
 then went over to the couch, where he had placed his jacket. He took a small bottle from his pocket and poured the contents into Kat's drink. He returned to the bar and stirred Kat's drink and smelled it. There was no odor. He took the two glasses back t
o the bedroom, and handed Kat her drink.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189

It was Honey who arrived at the apartment first and stumbled across Kat's mutilated body, lying in a pool of blood on the floor of the bathroom, obscenely sprawled against the cold white tiles. A bloodstained curette lay beside her. She had hemorrhaged fr

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No. She had a date with Dr. Mallory."
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ken Mallory was in bed, carefully going over the events of the evening. He replayed every step of the way, making sure there were no loose ends. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Perfect, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he decided. He 
lay in bed, wondering why it was taking doorbell rang. Mallory let it ring three times, then got up, put on a robe over his pajamas, and went into the living room.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He stood in front of the door. "Who's there?" He sounded sleepy.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A voice said, "Dr. Mallory?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Inspector Burns.  San Francisco Police Depart\-ment."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Police Department?" There was just the right note of surprise in his voice. Mallory opened the door.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The man standing in the hall showed his badge. "May I come in?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. What's this all about?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Do you know a Dr. Hunter?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Of course I do." A look of alarm crossed his face. "Has something happened to Kat?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Were you with her earlier this evening?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm afraid I have some bad news. Dr. Hunter is dead."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dead? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I can't believe it. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 How?'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Apparently she tried to perform an abortion on her\-self and it went wrong."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh, my God!" Mallory said. He sank into a chair. "It's my fault."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The inspector was watching him closely.   "Your fault?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes. I ... Dr. Hunter and I were going to be married. I told her I didn't think it was a good idea for her to have a baby now. I wanted to wait, and she agreed. I suggested she go to the hospital and have them take care of 
it, but she must have decided to ... I ... I can't believe it."
\par "What time did you leave Dr. Hunter?" "It must have been about ten o'clock. I dropped her off at her apartment and left."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You didn't go into the apartment?" "No."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Did Dr. Hunter talk about what she planned to do?" "You mean about the . . . ? No. Not a word." Inspector Burns pulled out a card. "If you think of anything else that might be helpful, doctor, I'd appreci\-
ate it if you gave me a call."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Certainly. I ... you have no idea what a shock this is."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Honey stayed up all night, talking about what had happened to Kat, going over it and over it, in shocked disbelief.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 At nine o'clock, Inspector Burns came by.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Good morning. I wanted to tell you that I spoke to Dr. Mallory last night."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 ' 'He said they went out to dinner, and then he dropped her off and went home."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He's lying," Paige said. She was thinking. "Wait! Did they find any traces of semen in Kat's body?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, as a matter of fact."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, then," Paige said excitedly, "that proves he's lying. He did take her to bed and\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I went to talk to him about that this morning. He says they had sex }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 before }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 they went out to dinner."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Oh." She would not give up. "His fingerprints will be on the curette he used to kill her." Her voice was eager. "Did you find fingerprints?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, doctor," he said patiently. "They were hers."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "That's imp\emdash Wait! Then he wore gloves, and when he was finished, he put her prints on the curette. How does that sound?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Like someone's been watching too many }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Murder, She Wrote }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 television programs."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You don't believe Kat was murdered, do you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm afraid I don't."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Have they done an autopsy?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The medical examiner is listing it as an accidental death. Dr. Mallory told me she decided not to have the baby, so apparently she\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Went into the bathroom and butchered herself?" Paige interrupted. "For God's sake, inspector! She was a doctor, a surgeon! There's no way in the world she would have done that to herself."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Inspector Burns said thoughtfully, "You think Mal\-lory persuaded her to have an abortion, and tried to help her, and then left when it went wrong?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige shook her head. "No. It couldn't have hap\-pened that way. Kat would never have agreed. He delib\-
erately murdered her.'' She was thinking out loud. "Kat was strong. She would have had to be unconscious for him to ... to do what he did."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The autopsy showed no signs of any blows or any\-thing that would have caused her to become uncon\-scious. No bruises on her throat ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Were there any traces of sleeping pills or . . . ?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Nothing." He saw the expression on Paige's face. "This doesn't look to me like a murder. I think Dr. Hunter made an error in judgment, and . . . I'm sorry."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She watched him start toward the door. "Wait!" Paige said. "You have a motive."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He turned. "Not really. Mallory says she agreed to have the abortion. That doesn't leave us much, does it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It leaves you with a murder," Paige said stubbornly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Doctor, what we }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 don't }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 have is any evidence. It's his word against the victim's, and she's dead. I'm really sorry."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige watched him leave.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'm not going to let Ken Mallory get away with it, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought despairingly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason came by to see Paige. "I heard what hap\-pened," he said. "I can't believe it! How could she have done that to herself?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "She didn't," Paige said. "She was murdered." She told Jason about her conversation with Inspector Burns. "The police aren't going to do anything about it. They think it was an accident. Jason, it's my fault that Kat is dead."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Your fault?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm the one who persuaded her to go out with Mal\-lory in the first place. She didn't want to. It started out as a silly joke, and then she . . . she fell in love with him. Oh, Jason!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You can't blame yourself for that," he said firmly.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked around in despair. "I can't live in this apartment anymore. I have to get out of here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason took her in his arms. "Let's get married right away."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's too soon. I mean, Kat isn't even ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know. We'll wait a week or two."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I love you, Paige."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I love you, too, darling. Isn't it stupid? I feel guilty because Kat and I both fell in love, and she's dead and I'm alive."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The photograph appeared on the front page of the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 San Francisco Chronicle }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 on Tuesday. It showed a smil\-ing Ken Mallory with his a
rm around Lauren Harrison. The caption read: "Heiress to Wed Doctor."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige stared at it in disbelief. Kat had been dead for only two days, and Ken Mallory was announcing his engagement to another woman! All the time he had been promising to marry Kat, he had been planning to marry someone else. 

\par 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That's why he killed Kat. To get her out of the way! 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige picked up the telephone and dialed police head\-quarters.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Inspector Burns, please."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A moment later, she was talking to the inspector.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This is Dr. Taylor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Have you seen the photograph in this morning's }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Chronicle?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, there's your motive!" Paige exclaimed. "Ken Mallory had to shut Kat up before Lauren Har\-rison found out about her. You've got to arrest Mal\-lory." She was almost yelling into the telephone.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wait a minute. Calm down, doctor. We may have a motive, but I told you, we do
n't have a shred of evidence. You said yourself that Dr. Hunter would have had to be unconscious before Mallory could perform an abortion on her. After I spoke to you, I talked to our forensic pathologist again. There was no sign of any kind of blow that 
could have caused unconsciousness."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Then he must have given her a sedative," Paige said stubbornly. "Probably chloral hydrate. It's fast-acting and\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Inspector Burns said patiently, "Doctor, there was no trace of chloral hydrate in her body. I'm sorry\emdash I really am\emdash but we can't arrest a man because he's going to get married. Was there anything else?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Everything else. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No," Paige said. She slammed down the receiver and sat there thinking. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory has to have given Kat some kind of drug. The easiest place for 
him to have gotten it would be the hospital phar\-macy.
\par 
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Fifteen minutes later, Paige was on her way to Embarcadero County Hospital.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Pete Samuels, the chief pharmacist, was behind the counter. "Good morning, Dr. Taylor. How can I help you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I believe Dr. Mallory came by a few days ago and picked up some medication. He told me the name of it, but I can't remember what it was."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Samuels frowned. "I don't remember Dr. Mallory coming by here for at least a month."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you sure?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Samuels nodded. "Positive. I would have remem\-bered. We always talk football."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's heart sank. "Thank you."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He must have written a prescription at some other pharmacy. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige knew that the law required that all prescriptions for narcotics be made out in triplicate\emdash  one copy for the 
patient, one to be sent to the Bureau of Controlled Substances, and the third for the pharmacy's files.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Somewhere, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Ken Mallory had a pre\-scription filled. There are probably two or three hun\-dred pharmacies in San Francisco. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
There was no way she could track down the prescription. It was likely that Mallory had gotten it just before he murdered Kat. That would have been on Saturday or Sunday. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 If it was Sun\-day, I might have a chance, }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Very few pharmacies are open on Sunday. That narrows it down.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
She went upstairs to the office where the assignment sheets were kept and looked up the roster for Saturday. Dr. Ken Mallory had been on call all day, so the chances were that he had had the prescription filled on Sunday. How many pharma
cies were open on Sunday in San Francisco?
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige picked up the telephone and called the state pharmaceutical board.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This is Dr. Taylor," Paige said. "Last Sunday, a friend of mine left a prescription at a pharmacy. She asked me to pick it up for her, but I can't remember the name of the pharmacy. I wonder if you could help me."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, I don't see how, doctor. If you don't know ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Most drugstores are closed on Sunday, aren't they?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, but . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'd appreciate it if you could give me a list of those that were open."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a pause. "Well, if it's important ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's very important," Paige assured her.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hold on, please."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There were thirty-six stores on the list, spread all over the city. It would have been simple if she could have gone to the police for help, but Inspector Burns did not believe her. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Honey and I are going to have to do this ourselves, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. She explained to Honey what she had in mind.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a real long shot, isn't it?" Honey said. "You don't even know if he filled the prescription on Sun\-day."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's the only shot we have." }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That Kat has. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll check out the ones in Richmond, the Marina, North Beach,
 Upper Market, Mission, and Potrero, and you check out the Excelsior, Ingleside, Lake Merced, West\-ern Addition, and Sunset areas."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "All right."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
\par At the first pharmacy Paige went into, she showed her identification and said, "A colleague of mine, Dr. Ken Mallory, was in here Sunday for a prescription. He's out of town, and he asked me to get a refill, but I can't remember the name of it. Would you 
mind look\-ing it up, please?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Ken Mallory? Just a moment." He came back a few minutes later. "Sorry, we didn't fill any prescrip\-tions Sunday for a Dr. Mallory."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige got the same response at the next four pharmac\-ies.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Honey was having no better luck.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "We have thousands of prescriptions here, you know."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know, but this was last Sunday."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Well, we have no prescriptions here from a Dr. Mallory. Sorry."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The two of them spent the day going from pharmacy to pharmacy. They were both getting d
iscouraged. It was not until late afternoon, just before closing time, that Paige found what she was looking for in a small pharmacy in the Potrero district. The pharmacist said, "Oh, yes, here we are. Dr. Ken Mallory. I remember him. He was on his way to
 make a house call on a patient. I was impressed, because not many doctors do that these days."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 No resident ever made house calls. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's the pre\-scription for?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige found she was holding her breath.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Chloral hydrate."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was almost trembling with excitement. "You're sure?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It says so right here."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What was the patient's name?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked at the copy of the prescription. "Spyros Levathes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Would you mind giving me a copy of that prescrip\-tion?" Paige asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Not at all, doctor."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 One hour later, Paige was in Inspector Burns's office. She laid the prescription on his desk.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Here's your proof," Paige said. "On Sunday, Dr. Mallory went to a pharmacy miles away from where he lives, and had this prescription for chloral hydrate filled. 
He put the chloral hydrate in Kat's drink, and when she was unconscious, he butchered her to make it look like an accident."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You're saying he put the chloral hydrate in her drink and then killed her."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There's only one problem with that, Dr. Taylor. There }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 was }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 no chloral hydrate in her body."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There has to be. Your pathologist made a mistake. Ask him to check again."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He was losing his patience. "Doctor ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sat across from him, her eyes fixed on his face.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He sighed. "All right. I'll call him again. Maybe he }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 did }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 make a mistake."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par Jason picked Paige up for dinner. "We're having dinner at my house," he said. "There's something I want you to see."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 During the drive there, Paige brought Jason up to date on what was happening.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "They'll find the chloral hydrate in her body," Paige said. "And Ken Mallory will get what's coming to him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm so sorry about all this, Paige."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I know." She pressed his hand against her cheek. "Thank God for you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The car pulled up in front of Jason's home.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked out of the window and she gasped. Around the green lawn in front of the house was a new white picket fence.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She was alone in the dark apartment. Ken Mallory used the key that Kat had given hi
m and moved quietly toward the bedroom. Paige heard his footsteps coming toward her, but before she could move, he had leaped at her, his hands tight around her throat.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You bitch! You're trying to destroy me. Well, you aren't going to snoop around anymore." He began squeezing harder. "I outsmarted all of you, didn't I?" His fingers squeezed tighter. "No one can ever prove I killed Kat."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She tried to scream, but it was impossible to breathe. She struggled free, and was suddenly awake. She was alone in her room. Paige sat up in bed, trembling.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She stayed awake the rest of the night, waiting for Inspector Burns's phone call. 
\par 
\par It came at 10:00 }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a.m.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes." She was holding her breath.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I just got the }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 third }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 report from the forensic patholo\-gist."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And?" Her heart was pounding.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "There was no trace of chloral hydrate or any other sedative in Dr. Hunter's body. None."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That was impossible! There had to be.
 There was no sign of any blow or anything that would have caused her to become unconscious. No bruises on her throat. It didn't make sense. Kat had to have been unconscious when Mallory killed her. The forensic pathologist was wrong.}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige decided to go talk to him herself.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Dolan was in an irritable mood. "I don't like to be questioned like this," he said. "I've checked it three times. I told Inspector Burns that there was no trace of chloral hydrate in any of her organs, and there wasn't."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "But . . ."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Is there anything else, doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige looked at him helplessly. Her last hope was gone. Ken Mallory was going to get away with murder. "I . . .I guess not. If you didn't find any chemicals in her body, then I don't ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I didn't say I didn't find }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 any }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 chemicals."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She looked at him a moment. "You found some\-thing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Just a trace of trichloroethylene."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She frowned. "What would that do?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He shrugged. "Nothing. It's an analgesic drug. It wouldn't put anyone to sleep."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I see."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sorry I can't help you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige nodded. "Thank you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She walked down the long, antiseptic corridor of the morgue, depressed, feeling that she was missing some\-thing. She had been so sure Kat had been put to sleep with chloral hydrate.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 All he found was a trace of trichloroethylene. It wouldn't put anyone to sleep. But why would trichloro\-ethylene be in Kat's body? }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Kat had not been taking any medications. Paige stopped in the middle of the corri\-dor, her mind working furiously.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Paige arrived at the hospital, she went directly to the medical library on the fifth floor. It took her less than a minute to find trichloroethylene. The description read: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
A colorless, clear, volatile liquid with a specific gravity of 1.47 at 59 degrees F. It is a halogenated hydrocarbon, having the chemical formula CCl CCL:CHCl.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 And there, on the last line, she found what she was looking for. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When chloral hydrate is metabolized, it produces trichloroethylene as a by-product.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par "Chloral hydrate turns into trichloroethylene!" Paige said triumphantly. "Mallory lied when he said he didn't go back into the apartment with Kat. He put chloral hydrate in her drink. It has no taste when you mix it with alco
hol, and it only takes a few minutes for it to work. Then when she was unconscious, he killed her and made it look like a bungled abortion."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Doctor, if you'll forgive my saying so, that's a hell of a lot of speculation."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "No, it isn't. He wrote the prescription for a pa\-tient named Spyros Levathes, but he never gave it to him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "How do you know that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Because he }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 couldn't }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 have. I checked on Spyros Levathes. He has erythropoietic porphyria."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a genetic metabolic disorder. It causes photosensitivity and lesions, hypertension, tachycardia, and a few other unpleasant symptoms. It's the result of a defective gene."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I still don't understand."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Mallory didn't give his patient chloral hydrate because it would have killed him! Chloral hydrate is contraindicated for porphyria. It would have caused immediate convulsive seizures."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 For the first time, Inspector Burns was impressed. "You've really done your homework, haven't you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige pressed on. "Why would Ken Mallory go to a remote pharmacy and fill a prescription for a patient he knew he couldn't }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 give }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 it to? You've }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
got }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 to arrest him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 His fingers were drumming on his desk. "It's not that simple."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You've got to ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Inspector Burns raised a hand. "All right. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll talk to the district attorney's office and see whether they think we have a case."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige knew she had gone as far as she could. "Thank you, inspector."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'll get back to you."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 After Paige Taylor left, Insp
ector Burns sat there thinking about their conversation. There was no hard evidence against Dr. Mallory, only the suspicions of a persistent woman. He reviewed the few facts that he had. Dr. Mallory had been engaged to Kat Hunter. Two days after she died,
 he was engaged to Alex Harrison's daughter. Interesting, but not against the law.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory had said that he dropped Dr. Hunter off at her front door and did not go into the apartment. Semen was found in her body, but he had a plausible explana\-tion for that.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Then there was the matter of the chloral hydrate. Mallory had written a prescription for a drug that could have killed his patient. Was he guilty of murder? Not guilty?
\par Burns buzzed his secretary on the intercom. "Bar\-bara, get me an appointment with the district attorney this afternoon."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There were four men in the office when Paige walked in: the district attorney, his assistant, a man named Warren, and Inspector Burns.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 ' 'Thank you for stopping by, Dr. Taylor,'' the district attorney said. "Inspector

\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 I'll be out of this goddam madhouse soon, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. He headed toward Room 430.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 A resident was waiting for him in the corridor, outside the room. "I'm afraid we have a problem here," he said. "This is one of Dr. Peterson's patients, but Dr. Peterson isn't here. I'm having an a
rgument with one of the other doctors."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 They stepped inside. There were three people in the room\emdash a man in bed, a male nurse, and a doctor Mal\-lory had not met before.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The resident said, "This is Dr. Edwards. We need your advice, Dr. Mallory."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What's the problem?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The resident explained. "This patient is suffering from erythropoietic porphyria, and Dr. Edwards insists on giving him a sedative."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't see any problem with that."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thank you," Dr. Edwards said. "The man hasn't slept in forty-eight hours. I've prescribed chloral hydrate for him so he can get some rest and ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was looking at him in astonishment. "Are you out of your mind? That could kill him! He'd have a convulsive seizure, tachycardia, and he'd probably die. Where in hell did you study medicine?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The man looked at Mallory and said quietly, "I didn't." He flashed a badge. "I'm with the San Fran\-cisco Police Department, Homicide." He turned to the man in bed. "Did you get that?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The man pulled out a tape recorder from under the pillow. "I got it."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Mallory was looking from one to the other, frowning. "I don't understand. What is this? What's going on?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The inspector turned to Mallory. "Dr. Mallory, you're under arrest for the murder of Dr. Kate Hunter."

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The news of Paige's inheritance was the talk of the hospital. Somehow, Paige had hoped it could be kept quiet. She still had not made up her mind about what to do with the money. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
It doesn't belong to me, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He has a family.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was not emotionally ready to go back to work, but her patients had to be taken care of. An operation was scheduled for that morning. Arthur Kane was wait\-
ing for Paige in the corridor. They had not spoken to each other since the incident of the reversed X-rays.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Although Paige had no proof it was Kane, the tire-slashing episode had scared her.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Hello, Paige. Let's let bygones be bygones. What do you say?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige shrugged. "Fine."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Wasn't that a terrible thing about Ken Mallory?" he asked.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes," Paige said.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kane was looking at her slyly. "Can you imagine a doctor deliberately killing a human being? It's horrible, isn't it?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "By the way," he said, "congratulations. I hear that you're a millionairess."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I have tickets for the theater tonight, Paige. I thought that the two of us could go."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Thanks," Paige said. "I'm engaged to someone."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Kane moved closer to her. "I ordered an autopsy on John Cronin."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige found her heart beginning to beat faster. "Yes?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "He didn't die of heart failure. Someone gave him an overdose of insulin. I guess that particular someone never figured on an autopsy."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige's mouth was suddenly dry.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You were with him when he died, weren't you?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She hesitated. "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I'm the only one who knows that, and I'm the only one who has the report." He patted her arm.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And my lips are sealed. Now, about those tickets}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 tonight ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige pulled away from him. "No!" "Are you sure you know what you're doing?" She took a deep breath. "Yes. Now, if you'll excuse}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 me ..." And she walked away. Kane looked after her, and his face hardened. He turned and headed toward Dr. Benjamin Wallace's office.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The telephone awakened her at 1:00 }{\scaps\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a.m. }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 at her apart\-ment.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You have been a naughty girl again." It was the same raspy voice disguised in a breathy whisper, but this time Paige recognized it. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 My God, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she thought, }{

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was the final day of the trial. Alan Penn, the defense attorney, was making his summation to the jury. "Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard a lot of testimony about Dr. Taylor's competence or incompe\-
tence. Well, Judge Young will instruct you that that's not what this trial is about. I'm sure that for every doctor who did not approve of her work, we could produce a dozen doctors who did. But that is not the issue.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Paige Taylor is on trial for the death of John Cronin. She has admitted helping him die. She did so because he was in great pain, and he asked her to do so. That is euthanasia, and it's being 
accepted more and more throughout the world. In the past year, the California Supreme Court has upheld the right of a mentally com\-petent adult to refuse or demand the withdrawal of medi\-
cal treatment of any form. It is the individual who must live or die with the course of treatment chosen or re\-jected."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He looked into the faces of the jurors. "Euthanasia is a crime of compassion, of mercy, and I daresay it takes place in some form or ano
ther in hospitals all over the world. The prosecuting attorney is asking for a death sentence. Don't let him confuse the issue. There has never been a death sentence for euthanasia. Sixty-three percent of Americans believe euthanasia should be le\-
gal, and in eighteen states in this country, it }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 is }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
legal. The question is, do we have the right to compel helpless patients to live in pain, to force them to stay alive and suffer? The question has become complicated because of the great strides we've made in medic
al technology. We've turned the care of patients over to machines. Machines have no mercy. If a horse breaks a leg, we put it out of its misery by shooting it. With a human being, we condemn him or her to a half life that is hell.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Taylor didn't decid
e when John Cronin would die. John Cronin decided. Make no mistake about it, what Dr. Taylor did was an act of mercy. She has taken full responsibility for that. But you can rest assured that she knew nothing about the money that was left to her. What she
 did, she did in a spirit of compassion. John Cronin was a man with a failing heart and an untreatable, fatal cancer that had spread through his body, causing him agony. Just ask yourself one question. Un\-
der those circumstances, would you like to go on living? Thank you." He turned, walked back to the table, and sat next to Paige.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable rose and stood before the jury. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Com\-passion? Mercy?" }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
He looked over at Paige, shook his head, then turned back to the jury. "Ladies and gentlemen, I have been practicing law in courtrooms for more than twenty years, and I must tell you that in all those years, I have never\emdash never\emdash 
seen a more clear-cut case of coldblooded, deliberate murder for profit."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was hanging on every word, tense and pale.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "The defense talked about euthanasia. Did Dr. Tay\-
lor do what she did out of a feeling of compassion? I don't think so. Dr. Taylor and others have testified that Mr. Cronin had only a few more days to live. Why didn't she let him live those few days? Perhaps it was becaus
e Dr. Taylor was afraid Mrs. Cronin might learn about her husband changing his will, and put a stop to it.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "It's a most remarkable coincidence that immediately after Mr. Cronin changed his will and left Dr. Taylor the sum of one million dollars, she gave him an overdose of insulin and murdered him.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Again and again, the defendant has convicted her\-self with her own words. She said that she was on friendly terms with John Cronin, that he liked and re\-spected her. But you have heard witnesses testify that h
e hated Dr. Paige Taylor, that he called her 'that bitch,' and told her to keep her fucking hands off him."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable glanced at the defendant again. There was a look of despair on Paige's face. He turned back to the jury. "An attorney has testified tha
t Dr. Taylor said, about the million dollars that was left to her, 'It's unethical. He was my patient.' But she grabbed the money. She needed it. She had a drawer full of travel brochures at home\emdash 
Paris, London, the Riviera. And bear in mind that she didn't go to the travel agency }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 after }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 she got the money. Oh, no. She planned those trips earlier. All she needed was the money and the opportu\-
nity, and John Cronin supplied both. A helpless, dying man she could control. She had at her mercy a man who she admitted was in enormous pain\emdash 
agony, in fact, according to her own admission. When you're in that kind of pain, you can imagine how difficult it must be to think clearly. We don't know }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 how }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Dr. Taylor persuaded John Cronin to change his will, to cut out the family he loved and to make her his main benefi\-ciary. What we }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 do }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
know is that he summoned her to his bedside on that fatal night. What did they talk about? Could he have offered her a million dollars to put him out of his misery? It's a possibility we must face. In either case, it was cold-blooded murder.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Ladies and gentlemen, during this trial, do you know who was the most damaging witness of all?" He pointed a dramatic finger at Paige. "The defendant herself! We've heard testimony that she gave an illegal bl
ood transfusion and then falsified the record. She has not denied that fact. She said that she never killed a patient except John Cronin, but we've heard testimony that Dr. Barker, a physician respected by everybody, accused her of killing his patient.

\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "U
nfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, Lawrence Barker suffered a stroke and can't be here with us today to testify against the defendant. But let me remind you of Dr. Barker's opinion of the defendant. This is Dr. Peterson, testifying about a patient Dr. Ta
ylor was op\-erating on."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 He read from the transcript.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Dr. Barker came into the operating room during the operation?'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes.'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "And did Dr. Barker say anything?'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Answer: 'He turned to Dr. Taylor and said, "You killed him.'"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This is from Nurse Berry. 'Tell me some specific things you heard Dr. Barker say to Dr. Taylor.'}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Answer: 'He said she was incompetent. . . Another time he said he wouldn't let her operate on his dog.' "
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable looked up. "Either there is some kind of conspiracy going on, where all these reputable doctors and nurses are lying about the defendant, or Dr. Taylor is a liar. Not }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 just }{
\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 a liar, but a pathologi\-cal ..."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The rear door of the courtroom had opened and an aide hurried in. He paused in the doorway a moment, trying to make a decision. Then he moved down the aisle toward Gus Venable.

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Sir ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable turned, furious. "Can't you see I'm. . .?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The aide whispered in his ear.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable looked at him, stunned. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What! }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That's wonderful!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young leaned forward, her voice ominously quiet. "Forgive me for interrupting you two, but what exactly do you think you're doing?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable turned to the judge excitedly. "Your honor, I've just been informed that Dr. Lawrence Barker is outside this courtroom. He's in a wheelchair, but he's able to testify. I'd like to call him to the stand."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a loud buzz in the courtroom.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn was on his feet. "Objection!" he yelled. "The prosecuting attorney is in the middle of his summation. There's no precedent for calling a new witness at this late hour. I\emdash "
\par Judge Young slammed her gavel down. "Would counsel please approach the bench."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Penn and Venable moved up to the bench.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This is highly irregular, your honor. I object ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young said, "You're right about its being ir\-regular, Mr. Penn, but you're wrong about its being without precedent. I can cite a dozen cases around the country where material witnesses were allowed to test
ify under special circumstances. In fact, if you're so inter\-ested in precedent, you might look up a case that took place in this courtroom five years ago. I happened to be the judge."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn swallowed. "Does this mean you're going to allow him to testify?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young was thoughtful. "Since Dr. Barker is a material witness to this case, and was physically un\-able to testify earlier, in the interest of justice, I'm going to rule that he be allowed to take the stand."
\par "Exception! There is no proof that the witness is competent to testify. I demand a battery of psychia\-trists\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Mr. Penn, in this courtroom, we don't demand. We request." She turned to Gus Venable. "You may bring in your witness."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn stood there, deflated. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It's all over, }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 he thought. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Our case is down the drain.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable turned to his aide. "Bring Dr. Barker in."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The door opened slowly, and Dr. Lawrence Barker entered the courtroom. He was in a wheelchair. His head was tilted, and one side of his face was drawn up in a slight rictus.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Everyone watched the pale and fragile figure being wheeled to the front of the courtroom. As he moved past Paige, he looked over at her.
\par 
\par There was no friendliness in his eyes, and Paige re\-membered his last words: }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Who the hell do you think you }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 . . .?
\par 
\par When Lawrence Barker was in front of the bench, Judge Young leaned forward and said gently, "Dr. Barker, are you able to testify here today?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Barker spoke, his words were slurred. "I am, your honor.''}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Are you fully aware of what is going on in this courtroom?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes, your honor." He looked over to where Paige was seated. "That woman is being tried for the murder of a patient."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige winced. }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 That woman
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young made her decision. She turned to the bailiff. "Would you swear the witness in, please?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 When Dr. Barker had been sworn in, Judge Young said, "You may stay in the chair, Dr. Barker. The prosecutor will proceed, and I will allow the defense to cross-examine."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
Gus Venable smiled. "Thank you, your honor." He strolled over to the wheelchair. "We won't keep you very long, doctor, and the court deeply appreciates your coming in to testify under these trying circumstances. Are you familiar with any o
f the testimony that has been given here over the past month?"
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker nodded. "I've been following it on television and in the newspapers, and it made me sick to my stomach."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige buried her head in her hands.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 It was all Gus Venable could do to hide his feeling of triumph. "I'm sure a lot of us feel the same way, doctor," the prosecutor said piously.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I came here because I want to see justice done."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Venable smiled. "Exactly. So do we."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Lawrence Barker took a deep breath, and when he spoke, his voice was filled with outrage. "Then how the hell could you bring Dr. Taylor to trial?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Venable thought he had misunderstood him. "I beg your pardon?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "This trial is a farce!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige and Alan Penn exchanged a stunned look.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable turned pale. "Dr. Barker ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't interrupt me," Barker snapped. "You've used the testimony of a lot of biased, jealous people to attack a brilliant surgeon. She\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Just a minute!" Venable was beginning to panic. "Isn't it true that you criticized Dr. Taylor's ability so severely that she was finally ready to quit Embarcadero Hospital?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Yes."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable was starting to feel better. "Well, then," he said patronizingly, "How can you say that Paige Taylor is a brilliant doctor?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 
"Because it happens to be the truth." Barker turned to look at Paige, and when he spoke again, he was talking to her as though they were the only two people in the courtroom: "Some people are born to be doctors. You were one of those rare ones.
 I knew from the beginning how capable you were. I was hard on you\emdash  maybe too hard\emdash 
because you were good. I was tough on you because I wanted you to be tougher on yourself. I wanted you to be perfect, because in our profession, there's no room for error. None."
\par 
\par Paige was staring at him, mesmerized, her mind spin\-ning. It was all happening too fast.
\par The courtroom was hushed.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I wasn't about to let you quit."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Gus Venable could feel his victory slipping away. His prize witness had become his worst nightmare. "Dr. Barker\emdash it has been testified that you accused Dr. Tay\-lor of killing your patient Lance Kelly. How . . . ?"}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I told her that because she was the surgeon in charge. It was her ultimate responsibility. In fact, the anesthetist caused Mr. Kelly's death."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 By now the court was in an uproar.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige sat there, stunned.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker went on speaking slowly, with an effor
t. "And as for John Cronin leaving her that money, Dr. Taylor knew nothing about it. I talked to Mr. Cronin myself. He told me that he was going to leave Dr. Taylor that money because he hated his family, and he said he was going to ask Dr. Taylor to rele
ase him from his misery. I agreed."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was an uproar from the spectators. Gus Ven\-able was standing there, a look of total bewilderment on his face.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Alan Penn leaped to his feet. "Your honor, I move for a dismissal!"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge   Young   was   slamming her gavel down. }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Quiet!" she yelled. She looked at the two attorneys. "Into my chambers."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young, Alan Penn, and Gus Venable were seated in Judge Young's chambers.
\par Gus Venable was in a state of shock. "I . . .I don't know what to say. He's obviously a sick man, your honor. He's confused. I want a battery of psychiatrists to examine him and\emdash "}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You can't have it both ways, Gus. It looks like your case just went up in smoke. Let's save you any further embarrassment, shall we? I'm going to grant a dismissal on the murder charge. Any objection?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 

\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was a long silence. Finally, Venable nodded. "I guess not."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Judge Young said, "Good decision. I'm going to give you some advice. Never, }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 never }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 call a witness unless you know what he's going to say."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 The court was in session again. Judge Young said, "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your time and your patience. The court is going to grant a dismissal on all charges. The defendant is free."}{
\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige turned to blow Jason a kiss, then hurried over to where Dr. Barker was seated. She slid down to her knees and hugged him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "I don't know how to thank you," she whispered.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You never should have gotten into this mess in the first place," he growled. "Damned fool thing to do. Let's get out of here and go somewhere where we can talk."
\par 
\par Judge Young heard. She stood up and said, "You may use my chambers if you like. That's the least we can do for you."
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige, Jason, and Dr. Barker were in the judge's chambers, alone.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Dr. Barker said, "Sorry they wouldn't let me come here to help you sooner. You know what goddam doc\-tors are like."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was near tears. "I can't tell you how much I ..."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Then don't!" he said gruffly.
\par }{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige was studying him, suddenly remembering something. "When did you speak to John Cronin?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "What?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "You heard me. When did you speak to John Cro\-nin?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "When?"}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 She said slowly, "You never even }{\i\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 met }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 John Cronin. You didn't know him."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 There was the trace of a smile on Barker's lips. "No. But I know you."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Paige leaned over and threw her arms around him.}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 "Don't get sloppy," he growled. He looked over at Jason. "She gets sloppy sometimes. You'd better take good care of her, or you'll have to answer to me."}{\fs28\insrsid1011189 
\par }{\fs28\cf1\insrsid1011189 Jason said. "Don't worry, sir. I will."
