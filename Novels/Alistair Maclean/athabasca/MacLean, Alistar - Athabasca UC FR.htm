</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>This book is not primarily </I>about <I>oil, but is based on oil and the means whereby oil is recovered from the earth, so it may be of some interest and help to look briefly at these phenomena.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>What oil is, and how it is formed in the first place, no one quite seems to know. The technical books and treatises on this subject are legion</I>—<I>I am aware that, personally, I haven't seen a fraction of them</I>— <I>and they are largely, so I am assured, in close agreement</I>—<I>except when they come to what one would have thought was a point of considerable interest: How, precisely, does oil </I>become <I>oil? There appear to be as many divergent theories about this as there are about the origins of life. Confronted with complexities, the well-advised layman takes refuge in over-simplification</I>—<I>which is what I now do, as I can do no other.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Only two elements were needed for the formation of oil</I>—<I>rock and the incredibly abundant plants and primitive living organisms that teemed in rivers, lakes and seas as far back as perhaps a billion years ago. Hence, the term fossil fuels.</I></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>nency of rock. Rock</I>—<I>the material of which the earth's crust is made</I>—<I>is neither eternal nor indestructible. Nor is it even unchanging. On the contrary, it is in a state of constant change, movement and flux, and it is salutary to remind ourselves that there was a time when no rock existed. Even today there is a singular lack of agreement among geologists, geophys-icists and astronomers as to how the earth came into being; but there is a measure of agreement that there was a primary incandescent and gaseous state, followed by a molten state, neither of which was conducive to the formation of anything, rock included. It is erroneous to suppose that rock has been, is and ever will be.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Yet we are not concerned here with the ultimate origins of rock, but rock as we have it today. It is, admittedly, difficult to observe this process of flux because a minor change may take ten million years; a major change, a hundred million.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Rock is constantly being destroyed and rebuilt. In the destructive process weather is the main factor; in the rebuilding, the forces of gravity.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Five main weather elements act upon rock. Frost and ice fracture rock. It can be gradually eroded by airborne dust. The action of the seas, whether through the constant movement of waves and tides or the pounding of heavy storm waves, remorselessly wears away the coastlines. Rivers are immensely powerful destructive agencies</I>—<I>one has but to look at the Grand Canyon to appreciate their enormous power. And such rocks as escape all these influences are worn away over the eons by the effect of rain.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Whatever the cause of erosion, the end result is the same: The rock is reduced to its tiniest possible constituents—rock particles or, simply, dust. Rain and melting snow carry this dust down to the tiniest</I></FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>rivulets and the mightiest rivers, which, in turn, transport it to lakes, inland seas and the coastal regions of the oceans. Dust, however fine and powdery, is still heavier than water, and whenever the water becomes sufficiently still, it will gradually sink to the bottom, not only in lakes and seas but also in the sluggish lower reaches of rivers and where flood conditions exist, in the form of silt.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>And so, over unimaginably long reaches of time, whole mountain ranges are carried down to the seas, and in the process, through the effects of gravity, new rock is born as layer after layer of dust accumulates on the bottom, building up to a depth of ten, a hundred, perhaps even a thousand feet, the lowermost layers being gradually compacted by the immense and steadily increasing pressures from above, until the particles fuse together and reform as new rock. -</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>It is in the intermediate and final processes of this new rock formation that oil comes into being. Those lakes and seas of hundreds of millions of years ago were almost choked by water plants and the most primitive forms of aquatic life. On dying, they sank to the bottom of the lakes and seas along with the settling dust particles and were gradually buried deep under the endless layers of more dust and more aquatic and plant life that slowly accumulated above them. The passing of millions of years and the steadily increasing pressures from above gradually changed the decayed vegetation and dead aquatic life into oil.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Described thus simply and quickly, the process sounds reasonable enough. But this is where the gray and disputatious area arises. The conditions necessary for the formation of oil are known; the cause of the metamorphosis is not. It seems probable that some form of chemical catalyst is involved, but this catalyst has not been isolated. The first purely synthetic oil,</I></FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>as distinct from secondary synthetic oils such as those derived from coal, has yet to be produced. We just have to accept that oil is oil, that it is there, bound up in rock strata in fairly well-defined areas throughout the world but always on the sites of ancient seas and lakes, some of which are now continental land, some buried deep under the encroachment of new oceans.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Had the oil remained intermingled with those deeply buried rock strata, and were the earth a stable place, that oil would have been irrecoverable. But our planet is a highly unstable place. There is no such thing as a stable continent securely anchored to the core of the earth. The continents rest on the so-called tectonic plates which, in turn, float on the molten magma below, with neither anchor nor rudder, free to wander in whichever haphazard fashion they will. This they unquestionably do. They are much given to banging into each other, grinding alongside each other, overriding or dipping under each other in a wholly unpredictable fashion and, in general, resembling rocks in the demonstration of their fundamental instability. As this banging and clashing takes place over periods of tens or hundreds of millions of years, it is not readily apparent to us except in the form of earthquakes</I>—<I>which generally occur where two tectonic plates are in contention.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>The collision of two such plates engenders incredible pressures, and two of the effects of such pressures are of particular concern here. In the first place the huge compressive forces involved tend to squeeze the oil from the rock strata in which it is imbedded and to disperse it in whichever direction the pressure permits</I>—<I>up, down or sideways. Secondly, a collision buckles or folds the rock strata themselves, the upper strata being forced upward to form mountain ranges</I>—</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>the northern movement of the Indian tectonic plate created the Himalayas</I>—<I>and the lower strata buckling to create what are virtually subterranean mountains, folding the layered strata into massive domes and arches.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>It is at this point, insofar as oil recovery is concerned, that the nature of the rocks themselves become of importance. The rock can be porous or non-porous. The porous rock</I>—<I>such as gypsum—permits liquids, such as oil, to pass through them, while the non-porous</I>—<I>such as limestone</I>—<I>does not. In the case of porous rock, the oil, influenced by those compressive forces, will seep upward through the rock until the distributive pressure eases, when it will come to rest at or very close to the surface of the earth. In the case of non-porous rock, the oil will become trapped in a dome or arch, and in spite of the great pressures from below can escape neither sideways nor upward but must remain where it is.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>In this latter case, what are regarded as conventional methods are used in the recovery of oil. Geologists locate a dome, and a hole is drilled. With reasonable luck they hit an oil dome and not a solid one, and their problems are over—the powerful subterranean pressures normally drive the oil to the surface.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>The recovery of seepage oil which has passed upward through porousTock presents a quite different and far more formidable problem, the answer to which was not found until as late as 1967. Even then it was only a partial answer. The trouble, of course, is that this surface seepage oil does not collect in pools, but is inextricably intermixed with foreign matter, such as sand and clay, from which it has to be abstracted and refined.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>It is, in fact, a solid and has to be mined as such;</I></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>andvtlthough this solidified oil may go as deep as six thousand feet, only the first two hundred feet, in the limits of present-day knowledge and techniques, are accessible, and that only by surface mining. Conventional mining methods</I>—<I>the sinking of vertical shafts and the driving of horizontal galleries</I>—<I>would be hopelessly inadequate, as they would provide only the tiniest fraction of the raw material required to make the extraction process commercially viable. The latest oil extraction plant, which went into operation only in the summer of 1978, requires 10,000 tons of raw material every </I>hour,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Two excellent examples of the two different methods of oil recovery are to be found in the far northwest of North America. The conventional method of deep drilling is well exemplified by the Prudhoe Bay oil field on the Arctic shore of northern Alaska: its latter-day counterpart, the surface mining of oil, is to be found</I>—<I>and, indeed, it is the only place in the world where it can be found</I>—<I>in the tar sands of Athabasca.</I></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This,&quot; said George Dermott, &quot;is no place for us.&quot; He eased his considerable bulk back from the dining table and regarded the remains of several enormous lamb chops with disfavor. &quot;Jim Brady expects/his field operatives to be lean, fit and athletic. Are we lean, fit and athletic?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There are desserts,&quot; Donald Mackenzie said. Like Dermott he was a large and comfortable man— a little larger and a little less comfortable than his partner—with a rugged, weatherbeaten face. Observers often took him and his partner for a pair of retired heavyweight boxers. &quot;I can see cakes, cookies and a wide variety of pastries,&quot; he went on. &quot;You read their food brochure? Says that the average man requires at least five thousand calories a day to cope with Arctic conditions. But we, George, are not average men. Six thousand would do better in a pinch. Nearer seven would be safer, I'd say. Chocolate mousse and double cream?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He had a notice about it on the staff bulletin board,&quot; Dermott said wryly. &quot;Heavy black border, for some reason. Signed, too.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie heaved his 220 pounds erect and headed purposefully for the food counter. There was no doubt that BP/Sohio did extremely well by their staff. Here at Prudhoe Bay, on the bitter rim of the Arctic Ocean in midwinter, the spacious, light and airy dining room, with multicolored pastel walls backdropping the recurrent five-pointed-star motif, was maintained at a pleasantly fresh 72&deg; F. by the air-conditioned central heating. The temperature difference between the dining room and the outside world was 105 degrees. The range of excellently cooked food was also astonishing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't exactly starve themselves up here,&quot; he said as he returned with a mousse for each of them and a pitcher of heavy cream. &quot;I wonder what the old Alaskan sour-doughs would have made of it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The first reaction of a prospector or trapper of yesteryear would have been that he was suffering from hallucinations. All in all, it was hard to say what feature he would have found the most astonishing. Eighty per cent of the items on the menu would have been unknown to him. But he would have been still more amazed by the forty-foot swimming pool and the glassed-in garden, with its pine trees, birches, plants and profusion of flowers, that abutted on the dining room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;God knows what the old boys would have thought,&quot; said Dermott. &quot;You might ask <I>him, </I>though.&quot; He indicated a man heading in their direction. &quot;Jack London would have recognized this one right away.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">sleeves. A pair of sealskin gloves were suspended from his neck, and he carried a coonskin cap in his right hand. His hair was long and white and parted in the middle. He had a slightly hooked nose and clear blue eyes with deeply entrenched crow's feet, which could have been caused by too much sun, too much snow or a too highly developed sense of humor. The rest'of his face was obscured by a magnificent, grizzled beard and mustache, both of which were at that moment rimed by droplets of ice. The yellow hard hat swinging from his left hand struck a jarring note. He stopped <I>at </I>their table, and from the momentary flash of white teeth it could be assumed that he was smiling.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Dermott? Mr. Mackenzie?&quot; He offered his hand. &quot;Finlayson. John Finlayson.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I <I>am </I>the field operations manager.&quot; He pulled out a chair, sat, sighed and removed some ice particles from his beard. &quot;Yes, yes, I know. Hard to believe.&quot; He smiled again, gestured at his clothing. &quot;Most people think I've been riding the rods. You know, hobo on the boxcars. God knows why. Nearest railroad track's a long, long way from Prudhoe Bay. Like Tahiti and grass skirts. You know, gone native. Too many years on the North Slope.&quot; His oddly staccato manner of speech was indeed suggestive of a person whose contact with civilization was, at best, intermittent. &quot;Sorry I couldn't make it. Meet you, I mean. Deadhorse.&quot;</FONT><BR>

The wateringhole and the camel.&quot; Dermott checked himself. He was beginning to talk like Finlayson. &quot;Well, one little complaint, perhaps. Too many items on the lunch menu, too large a helping of any item. My colleague's waistline—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your colleague's waistline can take care of itself,&quot; Mackenzie said comfortably. &quot;But I do have a complaint, Mr. Finlayson.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can imagine.&quot; Another momentary flash of teeth, and Finlayson was on his feet. &quot;Let's hear it in my office. Just a few steps.&quot; He walked across the dining hall, stopped outside a door and indicated another door to the left. &quot;Master Operations Control Center. The heart of Prudhoe Bay—or the western half of it, at least. All the computerized process control facilities for the supervision of the field's operations.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;An enterprising lad with a satchelful of grenades could have himself quite a time in there.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Five seconds and he could close down the entire oil field. Come all the way from Houston just to cheer me up? This way.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He led them through the outer door, then through an inner one to a small office. Desks, chairs and filing cabinets, all in metal, all in battleship gray. He gestured them to sit and smiled at Mackenzie. &quot;As the French say, a meal without wine is like a day without sunshine.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's this Texas dust,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;Sticks in the gullet like no other dust. Laughs at water.&quot;</FONT><BR>

A couple of scotches on top of all that, and you've written off a million dollars' worth of equipment. Or you damage the pipeline. Or you kill yourself. Or, worst of all, you kill some of your mates. Comparatively, they had it easy in the old prohibition days—bulk smuggling from Canada, bathtub gin, illicit stills by the thousand. Rather different on the North Slope here—get caught smuggling in a teaspoonful of liquor, and that's it. No argument, no court of appeal. Out. But there's no problem—no one is going to risk eight hundred dollars a week for ten cents' worth of bourbon.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;When's the next flight out to Anchorage?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson smiled. &quot;All is not lost, Mr. Mackenzie.&quot; He unlocked a filing cabinet, produced <I>a </I>bottle of scotch and two glasses and poured with a generous hand. &quot;Welcome to the North Slope, gentlemen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I was having visions,&quot; said Mackenzie, &quot;of travelers stranded in an Alpine blizzard and a St. Bernard lolloping toward them with the usual restorative. You're not a drinking man?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly. One week in five when I rejoin my family in Anchorage. This is strictly for visiting VIPs.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Think of us as desert roses,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;Born to blush and bloom unseen.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think of it that way myself. But what do you do in those deserts? Your function, I mean.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Our function?&quot; Dermott considered. &quot;Oddly enough, I'd say our function is to reduce our worthy employer, Jim Brady, to a state of bankruptcy.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Jim </I>Brady? I thought his initial was A.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;His mother was English. She christened him Algernon. Wouldn't <I>you </I>object? He's always known as Jim. Anyway, there are only three people in the world any good at extinguishing oil-field fires, particularly gusher fires, and all three are Texas-based. Jim Brady's one of the three.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It used to be commonly accepted that there are just three causes of such oil fires: spontaneous combustion, which should never happen but does; the human factor, i.e., sheer carelessness; and mechanical failure. After twenty-five years in the business Brady recognized that there was a fourth and more sinister element involved that would come, broadly speaking, under the heading of industrial sabotage.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who would engage in sabotage? What would the motivation be?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well first we can rule out the most obvious— rivalry among the big oil companies. It doesn't exist. This notion of cut-throat competition exists only in the sensational press and among the more feebleminded of the public. To be a fly on the wall at a closed meeting of the oil lobby in Washington is to understand once and for all the meaning of the expression 'two minds with but a single thought, two hearts that beat as one.' Multiplied by twenty, of course. Let Exxon put up the price of gas by a penny today, and Gulf, Shell, BP, Elf, Agip and all the others will do the same tomorrow. Or even take Prud-</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">hoe Bay here. The classic example, surely, of co-operation—umpteen companies working hand-in-glove for the mutual benefit of all concerned—benefit of all the oil companies, that is. The state of Alaska and the general public might adopt a rather different and more jaundiced viewpoint.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So we rule out business rivalries. This leaves another kind of energy. Power. International power politics. Say Country X could seriously weaken enemy Country Y by slowing down its oil revenues. That's one obvious scenario. Then there's <I>internal </I>power politics. Suppose disaffected elements in an oil-rich dictatorship see a means of demonstrating their dissatisfaction against a regime that clasps the ill-gotten gains to its mercenary bosom or, at best, distributes some measure of the largesse to its nearest and dearest, while ensuring that the peasantry remains in the properly medieval state of poverty. Starvation does nicely as motivation. This kind of setup leaves room for personal revenge, the settling of old scores, the working off of old grudges.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And don't forget the pyromaniac who sees in oil a ludicrously easy target and the source of lovely flames. In short, there's room for practically everything, and the more bizarre and unimaginable, the more likely to happen. A case in point.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He nodded at Mackenzie. &quot;Donald and I have just returned from the Gulf. The local security men and the police were baffled by an outbreak of small fires—small, so-called, but with damage totaling two million dollars. Clearly the work of an arsonist. We tracked him down, apprehended him, and punished him. We gave him a bow and arrow.&quot;</FONT><BR>

They do <I>not </I>make pellets of hardened steel, which give off a splendid spark when they strike ferrous metal. This lad had a plentiful supply obtained from a local Arab boy who had a similar pistol and used those illegal pellets for hunting desert vermin. Incidentally, the Arab boy's old man, a prince of the blood royal, owned the oil field in question. The English boy's arrows have rubber tips.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure there's a moral there somewhere.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure, there's a lesson: The unpredictable is always with you. Our industrial sabotage division—that's Jim Brady's term for it—was formed six years ago. There are fourteen of us in it. At first it was a purely investigative agency. We went to a place after the deed had been done and the fire put out—as often as not it was Jim who put it out—and tried to find out who had done it, why, and what his <I>modus op-erandi </I>had been. Frankly, we had very limited success. Usually the horse had gone, and all we were doing was locking the empty stable door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now the emphasis has changed—we try to lock the damned door in such a fashion that no one can open it. In other words, prevention: The maximum tightening of both mechanical and human security. The response to this service has been remarkable— we're now the most profitable side of Jim's operations. By far. Capping off runaway wells, putting fires out, can't hold a candle, if you'll pardon the expression, to our security work. Such is the demand for our services that we could triple our division and still not cope with all the calls being made upon us.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">there. More accurately, there are next to no experienced operatives, and there's an almost total dearth of people qualified to be trained for the job. The combination of qualifications is difficult to come by. You have to have an investigative mind, and that, in turn, is based on an inborn instinct for detection—the Sherlock Holmes genes, shall we say.. You've either got it or not. It can't be inculcated. You have to have an &quot;eye and a nose for security, an <I>obsession, </I>almost—and this can only come from field experience. You have to have a pretty detailed knowledge of the oil industry worldwide. And, above all, you have to be an oilman.&quot;</FONT><BR>

First real chance we've had to try out our preventive medicine. We're just slightly puzzled on one point, Mr. Finlayson. You say you never heard of us until a couple of days ago. How come we're here, then? I mean, we knew of this three days ago when we arrived back from the Mideast.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">layson, is not classified. It's in the public domain. Big companies tend to be incredibly careless about such matters. Whether to reassure the public or burnish their own image by taking thorough-going precautions, they not only release large chunks of information about their activities but positively bombard the public with them. The information, of course, comes in disparate and apparently unrelated lumps. It requires only a moderately intelligent fella to piece them all together.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not that those big companies, such as Alyeska, who built your pipeline, have much to reproach themselves about. They don't even begin to operate in the same league of indiscretion as the all-time champs, the U. S. Government. Take the classic example of the declassification of the secret of the atom bomb. When the Russians got the. bomb, the Government thought there was no point in being secretive anymore and proceeded to tell all. You want to know how to make an atom bomb? Just send a pittance to the AEC in Washington and you'll have the necessary information by return mail. That this information could be used by Americans against Americans apparently never occurred to the towering intellects of Capitol Hill and the Pentagon, who seem to have been under the impression that the American criminal classes voluntarily retired <I>en masse </I>on the day of declassification.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson raised a defensive hand. &quot;Hold. Enough. I accept that you haven't infiltrated Prud-hoe Bay with a battalion of spies. Answer's simple. When I received this unpleasant letter—it was sent to <I>me, </I>not to our H.Q. in Anchorage—I talked to the general manager, Alaska. We both agreed that it was almost certainly a hoax.

People like us, although we're well enough up the ladder in our own fields, don't make final decisions on the safety and future of a ten-billion-dollar investment.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson retrieved a single sheet of notepaper from a drawer and passed it across.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;'My dear Mr. Finlayson,&quot;' Dermott read. &quot;Well, that's civil enough. 'I have to inform you that you will be incurring a slight spillage of oil in the near future. Not much, I assure you, just sufficient to convince you that we can interrupt oil flow whenever and wherever we please. Please notify ARCO.'&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott shoved the letter across to Mackenzie. &quot;Understandably unsigned. No demands. If this is genuine, it's intended as a softening-up demonstration in preparation for the big threat and big demand that will follow. A morale-sapper, if you will, designed to scare the pants off you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson's gaze was on the middle distance. &quot;I'm not so sure he hasn't done that already.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You notified ARCO?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yup. Oil field's split more or less half-and-half. We run the western sector. ARCO—Atlantic Richfield, Exxon, some smaller groups—they run the eastern sector.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We don't have one. Precipitation on the North Slope is very low, maybe six inches in a winter. High winds are the bugaboo. They blow up the surface snow so that the air can be completely opaque for thirty or forty feet above the ground. Just before Christmas a few years ago a Hercules, normally the safest of aircraft, tried to land in those conditions. Didn't make it. Two of the crew of four killed. Pilots have become a bit leery since—if a Hercules can crash, any aircraft can. These high winds and the surface snowstorms they generate—that snow can be driving along at seventy miles an hour—are the bane of our existence up here. That's why this operations center is built on pilings seven feet above ground—lets the snow blow right underneath. Otherwise we'd end the winter season buried under a</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Stiffening the thin red line. Hiring extra security guards for Fairbanks.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How does he set about that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Approach varies, I suppose. Really Bron-owski's department, Mr. Dermott. He has <I>carte blanche </I>in those matters. I suggest you ask him on his return.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, come on. You're his boss. Bosses keep tabs on their subordinates. Roughly, how does he recruit?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, he's probably built up a list of people whom he's personally contacted and who might be available in a state of emergency. I'm honestly not sure about this. I may be his boss, but when I delegate responsibility, I do just that. I do know that he approaches the chief of police and asks for suitable recommendations. He may or may not have put in an ad in the <I>All-Alaska Weekly</I>—that's published in Fairbanks.&quot; Finlayson thought briefly. &quot;I wouldn't say he's deliberately close-mouthed about this. I suppose when you've been a security man all your life you naturally don't let your left hand know what the right hand's doing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What kind of men does he recruit?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Almost all ex-cops—you know, ex-State Troopers.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As such, no, although I'd have thought security would have come as second nature to a State Trooper.&quot; Finlayson smiled. &quot;I imagine Sam's principal criterion is whether the man can shoot straight.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Rubbish. If that were happening, you'd know all about it because I'd be asking you questions about yourself. I've no intention of doing so, now or in the future.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My opinion hardly matters. What matters, I suppose, is that the Alaskan press was damned certain there was, and said so loud and clear.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Finlayson shrugged, Dermott went on, &quot;Could it have been because Alyeska is the biggest employer in the state, because the life blood of so many companies depends on their contracts with Alyeska? In other words, big money talking big?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because they'd been prevented for a whole day from getting to the scene of the accident, they believed Alyeska employees had been working feverishly during that time to clean up and minimize the effects of the accident, to remove the evidence of a major spillage and to conceal the fact that their failsafe system had failed dangerously.

For instance, if there's trouble in Valdez, he's a damn sight nearer it in his wife's flat in Anchorage than he would be if he were up here. And he's very mobile, is our Sam. Owns and flies his own Comanche. We pay his fuel, that's all.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course not. What's it got to do with the FBI?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It might have an awful lot to do with them, and soon. I know Alaskans think that this is a nation apart, that this is your own special and private fief-dom up here, and that you refer to us unfortunates as the lower forty-eight, but you're still part of the United States. When the oil from the pipeline arrives at Valdez, it's shipped to one of the West Coast states. Any interruption in oil transfer between Prudhoe Bay and, say, California, would be regarded as an unlawful interference with interstate commerce and would automatically bring in the FBI.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, it hasn't happened yet. Besides, what can the FBI do? They know nothing of oil or pipeline security. Look after the pipeline? They couldn't even look after themselves. We'd just spend most of our time trying to thaw out the few of them who didn't freeze to death during their first ten minutes here. They could only survive under cover, so what could they do there? Take over our computer terminals and master communications and alarm detection stations at Prudhoe Bay, Fairbanks and Valdez? We have highly trained specialists to monitor over three thousand sources of alarm information. Asking the FBI to do that would be like asking a blind man to read Sanskrit. Inside or out, they'd only be in the way and a useless burden to all concerned.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Alaska State Troopers could survive. I guess they'd survive where even some of your own men couldn't. Have you been in touch with them? Have you notified the state authorities in Juneau?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why not?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They don't love us. Oh, sure, if there was physical trouble—violence—they'd move in immediately. Until then, they'd rather not know. I can't say I blame them. And before you ask me why I'll tell you. For good or bad, we've inherited the Alyeska mantle. Alyeska built the pipeline and they run it, but we use it. I'm afraid there's a wide gray area of non-discrimination here. In most people's eyes they <I>were </I>pipeline, we <I>are </I>pipeline.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson reflected on his,next words. &quot;It's hard not to feel a bit sorry for Alyeska. They were pretty cruelly pilloried. Sure, they bore the responsibility for a remarkable amount of waste, and incurred vast cost overruns, but they did complete an impossible job in impossible conditions and, what's more, brought it in on schedule. Best construction company in North America at the time. Brilliant engineering and brilliant engineers—but the brilliance stopped short of their PR people, who might as well have been operating in downtown Manhattan for all they knew about Alaskans. Their job should have been to sell the pipeline to the people. All they succeeded in doing was in turning a large section of the population solidly against the line and the construction company.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He shook his head. &quot;You had to be truly gifted to get it as wrong as they did. They sought to protect the good name of Alyeska, but all they did, by blatant cover-ups—it was alleged—and by deliberate lying, was to bring whatever good name there was into total disrepute.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A charming directive,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Hush-up, cover-up or lose your contract. Toe the line or you're fired. A shining example of American democracy at its finest. Well, well.&quot; He glanced briefly at the paper, then at Finlayson. &quot;How did you get hold of this? Classified information, surely?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oddly enough, no. What you would call the public domain. Editorial page, <I>All-Alaska Weekly, </I>July 22, 1977. 1 don't question it <I>was </I>classified. How the paper got hold of it, I don't know.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nice to see a little paper going against the might of a giant company and getting away with it. Restores one's faith in something or other.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson picked up another photostat. &quot;The same editorial also made a despairing reference to the 'horrendous negative impact of the pipeline on us.' That's as true now as it was then. We've inherited this horrendous negative impact, and we're still suffering from it. So there it is. I'm not saying we're entirely friendless, or that the authorities wouldn't move in quickly if there were any overt violations of the law, but, because votes are important, those in charge of our destinies rule from behind.

Whatever happens, they're not going to antagonize those who keep them in power.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;So it amounts to this. Until actual sabotage occurs, you can expect no outside help. So far as preventive measures are concerned, you're dependent solely upon Bronowski and his security teams. In effect, you're on your own.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's an unhappy thought, but there it is.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott stood up and walked back and forth. &quot;Accepting this threat as real, who's behind it and what does he want? Not a crackpot, that's sure. If it were, say, some environmentalist running amok, he'd go ahead and do his damnedest without any prior warning. No, could be with a view to extortion or blackmail, which do not have to be the same thing. Extortion would be for money; blackmail could have many different purposes in mind. Stopping the flow of oil is unlikely to be that primary purpose. More likely, it'll be a stoppage for another and more important purpose. Money, politics—local or international—power, misguided idealism, genuine idealism or just crackpot irresponsibility. Well, I'm afraid speculation will have to wait on developments. Meantime, Mr. Finlayson, <B>I'd </B>like to see Bronowski as soon as possible.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't think you quite understand. Mr. Mackenzie and I have not only been promised total cooperation, we've been empowered to direct security measures if, in our judgment, such extreme measures are dictated by circumstances.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson's Yukon beard still masked his expression, but there was no mistaking the disbelief in his voice. &quot;You mean, take over from Bronowski?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If, again in our judgment, he's good enough, we just sit by the sidelines and advise. If not, we will exercise the authority invested in us.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's out of state. He's visiting our offices in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles. At what times and in what order I don't know. I do know he'll be back in Anchorage at noon tomorrow.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've told you, I don't know where he'd be. Ht could be <I>at </I>some other place altogether. Like as not, he's in the air.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You could try, couldn't you?&quot; Finlayson remained silent and Dermott spoke again. &quot;You could call London direct.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You don't know much about the hierarchy in oil companies, do you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. But I know this.&quot; Now Dermott's customary geniality was gone. &quot;You're a considerable disappointment, Finlayson. You are, or very well may be, in serious trouble. In the circumstances, one does not expect an executive in top management to resort to stiff outrage and wounded pride. You've got your priorities wrong, my friend—the good of the company comes first, not your feelings or protecting your ass.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson's eyes showed no expression. Mackenzie was staring at the ceiling as if he had found something of absorbing interest there. Dermott, he had learned over the years, was a past master at pinning an adversary into a corner. The victim either surrendered or placed himself in an impossible situation of which Dermott would take ruthless advantage. If he couldn't get co-operation, he would settle for nothing less than domination.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott went on, &quot;I have made three requests, all of which I regard as perfectly reasonable, and you have refused all three. You persist in your refusals?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Well, Donald, what are my options?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There are none.&quot; Mackenzie sounded sad. &quot;Only the inevitable.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finlayson said nothing. He took the card, lifted the phone and talked to the switchboard. After three minutes' silence, which only Finlayson seemed to find uncomfortable, the phone rang. Finlayson listened briefly then handed over the phone.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Brady Enterprises? Mr. Brady, please...Dermott.&quot; Thei*e was a pause, then, &quot;Good afternoon, Jim.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, well, George.&quot; Brady's strong carrying voice was clearly audible in the office. &quot;Prudhoe Bay, is it? Coincidence, coincidence. I was just on the point of phoning you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well. My report, Jim. News, rather. There's nothing to report.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And I have news for you. Mine first, it's more important. Open line?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One moment.&quot; Dermott looked at Finlayson. &quot;What security classification does your switchboard operator have?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None. Jesus, she's only a telephone girl.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As you so rightly observe, Jesus! Heaven help the trans-Alaska pipeline.&quot; He pulled out a notebook and pencil and addressed the phone. &quot;Sorry, Jim. Open. Go ahead.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In a clear, precise voice Brady began to recite a seemingly meaningless jumble of letters and figures which Dermott noted down in neatly printed script. After about two minutes Brady paused and said, &quot;Repeat?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No thanks.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have something to say?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was only a brief pause before Brady said clearly, &quot;Permission granted.&quot; There came the click of a replaced receiver and Dermott rose to his feet. Finlayson was already on his. &quot;Mr. Dermott—&quot; Dermott looked down at him icily and spoke in a voice as cold as winter, &quot;Give my love to London, Mr. Finlayson, if you're ever there.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">Two</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Thirteen hundred miles southeast of Prudhoe Bay, at ten P.M., Brady's men met Jay Shore in the bar of the Peter Pond Hotel in Fort McMurray. Among those qualified to pass judgment on such matters, it was readily agreed that as an engineering construction manager Shore had no peer in Canada. His face was dark, saturnine, almost piratical—which was rather an unfair trick for nature to play on him, since that same nature had made him easygoing, companionable, humorous and cheerful.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Not that he felt in the least humorous and cheerful at that moment. Nor did the man who sat beside him, Bill Reynolds, Sanmobil's operations manager, a rubicund and normally smiling man to whom nature had given precisely the kind of diabolical mind that Shore appeared to have but didn't.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bill Reynolds looked across the table to Der-mott and Mackenzie, whom he and Shore had met thirty seconds previously, and said, &quot;You make fast time, gentlemen. Remarkable service, if one may say so.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Head office—that's Edmonton—told us you might take up to four days. We didn't expect you in four <I>hours.&quot; </I>Reynolds eyed Dermott speculatively over his newly poured glass. &quot;I'm afraid we don't know much about you.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I did. Bill here was with me, listening in. Caller gave us his message twice. Word for word he said, 'I have to inform you that Sanmobil will be incurring a slight interruption in oil production in the near future. Not much, I assure you, just sufficient to convince you that we can interrupt oil flow whenever and wherever we please.' That was all.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. We have a problem here,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;I take it your security duties are twofold: the guarding of vital installations in the plant itself and patrolling the perimeter to keep intruders out?&quot;</FONT><BR>

In its heated state it emits a smell like that of sea-coal.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Oddly, the significance of the words &quot;sea-coal&quot; wasn't appreciated for more than a hundred years; nobody realized that the two eighteenth-century explorers had stumbled across one of the world's largest reservoirs of fossil fuels.

By now, though still a frontier town, it had become a frontier town with a difference. Treasuring its past, but with an eye to the future, it was the epitome of a boomtown and, in terms of burgeoning population, the fastest expanding township in Canada. Where there were thirteen hundred citizens fourteen years earlier, there were now thirteen thousand. Schools, &quot;hotels, banks, hospitals, churches, supermarkets and, above all, hundreds of new houses stood and more were being built. And, wonder of wonders, the streets were paved. This seeming miracle stemmed from one factor and one factor only: Fort McMurray sits squarely in the heart of the Athabasca tar sands, the biggest such known deposits in the world.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Probably. Not certainly. I don't know if you can dial direct from Anchorage to here. I don't think so, but we can find out. If not, the telephone operator will have a record. There's a chance that we might locate the phone.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would not be surprised.&quot; Mackenzie spoke with some feeling. &quot;We've done it often enough in this damned job of ours. Two ways, you said. What's the second way?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;If\ve </I>locate this pay phone, we have the police remove the coin box and give it to their fingerprint boys. The chances are good that the person who made the call to Fort McMurray used more high-denomination coins than anyone else who went into the pay phone that day—or night. Get two or three large coins with the same prints, and that's our man.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Objection. Coins are handled by many people. You'll get prints, all right. A plethora, shall we say, of fingerprints.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Objection overruled. It's established that on a metal surface—the overlay—the last person to touch such a surface leaves the dominant print. By the same token, we'd print the area around the dial. People don't dial in fur mittens. Then we'd check with criminal records. The prints may be on file. If they are, we'll get the man and ask him all sorts of interesting questions.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll bet the other Anchorage pillars would love to hear you say that. They'd have the same opinion of you as our friend John Finlayson has now.

The longer we stay away, the more certainly we're guaranteed his co-operation when we get back. Jim Brady may have been the bearer of bad news, but that call of his couldn't have come at a more opportune time. Gave us the perfect excuse to take off. Speaking of Jim—&quot;</FONT><BR>

Never a believer in traveling light, he brought with him on the flight from Houston not only his attractive, blond wife, Jean, but also his positively stunning daughter Stella, another natural blond, who acted as his secretary on these field trips. He left Jean behind at the hotel in Fort McMurray, hut kept Stella with him in the minibus that Sanmobil had sent to ferry him out to the plant.</FONT><BR>

Even so, it was clear to his companions that he was impressed.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This sure is something. You boys must have a lot of fun digging away here and building these nice little ol' sand castles.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's one way of putting it, Mr. Brady.&quot; Jay Shore spoke with restraint. &quot;Not much, perhaps, by Texas standards, but it's still the biggest mining operation in the history of mankind.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No offense, no offense.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That&quot; was a dragline, but a dragline such as Brady had never seen before. A dragline is essentially an engine housing with a control cabin that operates a cranelike boom. The boom is hinged and swiveled at the base of the engine housing, and so can be both raised and lowered and swung from side to side. Control is achieved by cables from the engine housing which pass over a massive steel super-structure and reach out to the tip of the boom. Another cable, passing over the tip of the boom, supports a bucket which can be lowered to scoop up material, raised again and then swung to one side to dump its load.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The boom. The comparison most generally used is that it's as long as a football field. Wrong— it's longer. From here the bucket doesn't look all that big, but that's only because everything is dwarfed out of perspective. It scoops up eighty cubic yards at a time or enough to fill a two-car garage. A large two-car garage. The dragline weighs sixty-five hundred tons—about the same as a light-medium cruiser. Cost? About thirty million dollars. Takes fifteen to eighteen months to build—on the site, of course. There are four of them, and between them they can shift up to a quarter of a million tons a day.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You win. This is a boomtown.&quot; Brady said. &quot;Let's get inside. I'm cold.&quot; The other four—Dermott, Mackenzie, Shore and Brinckman, the security chief-looked at him in mild astonishment. It seemed impossible that a man so extravagantly upholstered and insulated, both naturally and otherwise, could possibly feel even cool, but if Brady said he was cold, he was cold.</FONT><BR>

Also in excellent condition was the girl who sat down in the back seat, lowered her parka hood, and beamed at them.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not yet,&quot; Brady grunted. Once safely sheltered from the vicious cold, he undid the ends of the scarf that concealed his face. Somewhere in the distant past there must have been signs of the character that had driven him from the back streets of poverty to his present millions, but years of gracious living had eradicated all trace of them. Bone structure had vanished under a fatty accumulation which had left him without a crease, line or even the hint of crow's feet. It was a fat, spoiled face like a cherub's. With one exception: There was nothing cherubic about the eyes. They were blue, cool, appraising and shrewd.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The beginning of it,&quot; Shore said. &quot;The tar sands may lie as deep as fifty feet down. The stuff above, the overburden, is useless to us—gravel, clay, muskeg, shale, oil-poor sand—and has to be removed first of all.&quot; He pointed to an approaching vehicle. &quot;Here's some of that rubbish being carried away now—it's been excavated by another dragline on a new site.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To impress you further, Mr. Brady, those trucks are also the biggest in the world. A hundred and twenty-five tons empty, payload of a hundred and fifty, and all this on just four tires. But, you will admit, they are some tires.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The truck was passing now, and they were indeed some tires; to Brady, they looked at least ten feet high and proportionately bulky.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You could buy a very acceptable car for the price of one of those tires,&quot; Shore said. &quot;As for the truck itself, if you went shopping for one at today's prices, you wouldn't get much change from three quarters of a million.&quot; He spoke to his driver, who started up and moved slowly off.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When the overburden is gone, the same dragline scoops up the tar sand—as the one we've just looked at is doing now—and dumps it in this huge pile we call a windrow.&quot; A weird machine of phenomenal length was nosing into the pile. Shore pointed and said, &quot;A bucket-wheel reclaimer—there's one paired with every dragline. Four hundred and twenty-eight feet long. You can see the revolving bucket wheel biting into the windrow. With fourteen buckets on a forty-foot-diameter wheel, it can remove a fair tonnage every minute. The tar sands are then transported along the spine of the reclaimer— the bridge, we call it—to the separators. From there—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady interrupted, &quot;Separators?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sometimes the sands come in big, solid lumps as hard as rock, which could damage the conveyor belts. The separators are just vibrating screens that sort out the lumps.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And without the separators the conveyor belts could be damaged?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Put out of commission?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Probably. We don't know. It's never been allowed to happen yet.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And then?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The tar sands go into the traveling hoppers you see there. They drop the stuff onto the conveyor belt, and off it goes to the processing plant. After that—&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One minute.&quot; It was Dermott. &quot;You have a fair amount of this conveyor belting?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A fair bit.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How much exactly?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shore looked uncomfortable. &quot;Sixteen miles.&quot; Dermott stared at him and Shore hurried on. &quot;At the end of the conveyor system radial stackers direct it to what are called surge piles—-just really storage dumps.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Radial stackers?&quot; said Brady. &quot;What are they?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Elevated extensions of the conveyor belts. They can rotate through a certain arc to direct the tar sands to a suitable surge pile. They can also feed bins that take the sands underground to start the processes of chemical and physical separation of the bitumen. The first of those processes—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jesus!&quot; said Mackenzie incredulously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That about sums it up,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;I have no wish to be rude, Mr. Shore, but I don't want to hear about the extraction processes. I've already heard and seen all I want to.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good God Almighty!&quot; exclaimed Mackenzie by way of variation.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;What's the matter, gentlemen?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott picked his words carefully. &quot;When Don and I were talking to Mr. Shore and Mr. Reynolds, the operations manager, last night, we thought we had reason to be concerned. I now realize we were wasting our time on trifles. But, by God, now I am worried.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Last night we had to face the fact of the ridiculous ease with which the perimeter can be penetrated and the almost equal ease with which subversives could be introduced onto the plant floor. In retrospect, those are but bagatelles. How many points did you pick up, Don?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Six.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My count also. First off, the draglines. They look as impregnable as the Rock of Gibraltar. They are, in fact, pathetically vulnerable. A hundred tons of high explosive would hardly dent the Rock of Gibraltar, but I could take out a dragline with two five-pound charges of wrap-around explosive placed where the boom is hinged to the machine house.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brinckman, an intelligent and clearly competent person in his early thirties, spoke for the first time in fifteen minutes, then immediately wished he hadn't. He said, &quot;Fine, if you could approach the dragline—but you can't. The area is lit by brilliant floodlights.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jesus!&quot; Mackenzie's limited repertoire was in use again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean, Mr. Mackenzie?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What I mean is I would locate the breaker or switch or whatever that supplies the power to the floodlights and immobilize it by smashing it or by the brilliantly innovative device of turning it off. Or, I'd cut the power lines. Simpler still, with a five-second burst from a submachine gun I'd shoot them out. Assuming, of course, that they're not made of bulletproof glass.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott saved Brinckman the embarrassment of a long silence. &quot;Five pounds of commercial Amatol would take out the bucket wheel for an indefinite period. A similar amount would take care of the reclaimer's bridge. Two pounds to buckle the separator plate. That's four ways. Getting at the radial stackers would be another excellent device—that would mean Sanmobil couldn't even get the tar sands stockpiled in the surge piles down below for processing. And then, best of all, is this little matter of sixteen unpatrolled miles of conveyor belting.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was quiet in the bus until Dermott rumbled on. &quot;Why bother sabotaging the separation plant when it's so much simpler and more effective to interrupt the flow of raw material? You can't very well carry out a processing operation if you've got nothing to process. It'd be childishly simple. Four draglines. Four bucket wheels. Four reclaimers' bridges. Four separators. Four radial stackers. Sixteen miles of conveyor, fourteen miles of unpatrolled perimeter, and eight men to cover. Situation's ludicrous. I'm afraid, Mr. Brady, there's no way in the world we can stop our Anchorage friend from carrying out his threat.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady turned what appeared to be one cold, blue eye on the unfortunate Brinckman. &quot;And what do you have to say?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What can I say except to agree? Even if I had ten times the number of men at my disposal, we still wouldn't be geared to meet a threat like this.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't even dream of anything like this.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nor did anyone else. Nothing to reproach yourself about. You security people thought you were in the oil business, not at war. What are your normal duties, anyway?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We're here to prevent three things—physical trouble among members of the work force, petty pilfering, and drinking on the plant site. But so far we've had few instances of any of them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Visibly, Brinckman's words struck a chord in Brady. &quot;Ah, yes. Trouble in moments of stress and all that.&quot; He turned in his seat. &quot;Stella!&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Dad.&quot; She opened a wicker basket, produced a flask and glass, poured a drink and handed it to her father.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sorry, Mr. Brady,&quot; Shore said. &quot;No. The company has very strict regulations.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady gave him some terse suggestions as to what he could do with company regulations and turned to Brinckman again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So, in effect, you've been pretty superfluous up till now and, if anything, are going to be even more so in the future?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'd agree with half of that. The fact that we've had little to do up to now doesn't mean we've been superfluous. Presence is important. You don't heave a brick through <I>a </I>jeweler's window if there's an interested cop standing by five feet away. As to the future, yes, I agree. I feel pretty helpless.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If you were carrying out an attack somewhere, what would you go for?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brinckman was not of two minds. &quot;The conveyor belting every time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady looked at Dermott and Mackenzie. Both men nodded.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Shore?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Agreed.&quot; Shore was absentmindedly sipping some scotch that had found its way into his hand. &quot;Apart from the fact that there's so damn much of it, it's fragile. Six feet wide, but the steel cord belting is only an inch and a half thick. With a sledgehammer and chisel I could wreck it myself.&quot; Shore looked and sounded tense. &quot;Not many people are aware of the vast quantities of material that are processed here. To keep the plant operating at capacity and to make the project commercially viable, we need close on a quarter of a million tons of tar sands a day. As I said, the biggest mining operation ever. Cut off the supplies, and the plant closes down in a few hours.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">That's a hundred and thirty thousand barrels of oil <I>a </I>day lost. Even Sanmobil couldn't stand this kind of loss indefinitely.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How much did it cost to set up this plant?&quot; Brady asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two billion, near enough.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two billion dollars. And a potential operating loss of a hundred and thirty thousand barrels of oil a day.&quot; Brady shook his head. &quot;No one's arguing about the brilliance of the men who dreamed up this idea. Same goes for the engineers who made it work. But there's another thing no one would question— at least / would never question—and that is that those towering intellects had a huge blind spot. Why didn't the bosses foresee this? I know it's easy to be wise after the event, but, goddamn, you don't need much foresight to think of that. Oil is not just another business. Couldn't they have seen the giant potential for hate or crackpots—or blackmail? Couldn't they have foreseen that they'd built the biggest industrial hostage to fortune of all time?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shore gazed gloomily at his glass, gloomily drank its contents, and maintained a gloomy silence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Well, not quite.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean 'not quite'?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure, it's an industrial hostage to fortune. But not the biggest of all time. That dubious distinction belongs without any question to the trans-Alaska pipeline. Their capital outlay wasn't two billion—it was eight billion. They don't transport a hundred and thirty thousand barrels a day—they transport one million two hundred thousand. And they don't just have sixteen miles of conveyor belting to guard— they have eight hundred miles of pipeline.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady, handed his glass back for a refill, digested this unpleasant thought, fortified himself and</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">said, &quot;Don't they have <I>any </I>means of protecting the damned thing?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To the extent that they can limit damage, certainly. They have magnificent communication and electronic control systems, with every imaginable fail-safe and backup device, even to the extent of a satellite emergency control station.&quot; Dermott produced a paper from his pocket. &quot;They have twelve pump stations, locally or remotely controlled. They have sixty-two remote gate valves, all radio-controlled from the pump station immediately to the north. Those gate valves can stop the flow of oil in either direction.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There are eighty check valves to prevent the oil from flowing backward, and, well, all sorts of other weird valves that would only make sense to an engineer. Altogether they have a remote-control capability at well over a thousand points. In other words, they can isolate any section of the line at any time they want. Because it takes six minutes to shut down a big pump, some oil is bound to escape—up to fifty thousand barrels, it's estimated. That may seem a lot, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to what's in the pipeline. But there's no way the oil can keep on pumping out indefinitely.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;All very interesting.&quot; Brady sounded cool. &quot;You can bet they try harder to protect the environment. You can also bet that crooks and extortionists don't give a damn about the environment one way or another. All they want is to interrupt the flow of oil. Can the line be protected?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, about this huge blind spot you mentioned—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What you're trying not to tell me is that the pipeline can be breached any place, any time.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady looked at him maliciously and resumed his pondering. By and by he said, &quot;What happens if there's a break and the oil is stopped in the pipe? Does it gum up?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Eventually. But it takes time. The oil is hot when it comes out of the ground and it's still warm when it reaches Valdez. The pipeline is very heavily insulated, and the oil passing through the pipe generates friction heat. They reckon they might get it flowing again after a twenty-one-day standstill, maximum. After that—&quot; He spread his-hands.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No more oil flow?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not ever again?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I shouldn't think so. I don't really know. Nobody's talked to me about it. I don't think anyone really wants to talk about it.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Horseshit. Damn code. Take it, huh?&quot; This was hardly reasonable of Brady, since it was he who had invented the code and insisted on using it for almost everything except &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Good-bye.&quot; Dermott reached for a pad and pencil, took the phone and started writing. It took him about a minute to record the message and two more to decode it.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He said into the phone, &quot;Is that all you have?&quot; A pause. &quot;When did you get this message, and when did this happen?&quot; Another pause. &quot;Fifteen minutes and two hours. Thank you.&quot; He turned to Brady, his face bleak. &quot;The pipeline's been breached. Pump Station Number Four. Near Atigun Pass in the Brooks Range. No hard details yet. Damage not severe, it seems, but enough to close down the line.&quot;</FONT><BR>

Brady, Dermott and Mackenzie had moved quickly after receipt of the message from Houston. They had driven back to Fort Mc-Murray, packed essentials, which in Brady's case consisted primarily of three flasks, said good-bye to Jean and Stella and driven straight to the airport. Brady was asleep when they entered Yukon air space, and Mackenzie dozed off shortly afterward. Only Dermott remained awake, trying to puzzle out why the enemy, in carrying out what they said would be—and, in fact proved to be—no more than a token demonstration, should have found it necessary to kill in the process.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm being fair to him. I hope you will be, too. You can imagine how he feels. Says that if he hadn't been so ornery, those two men up at Pump Station Four might be alive now.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's plain daft,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;I appreciate his feelings, but this would have happened if there had been fifty Dermotts and fifty Mackenzies here.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When,&quot; Brady asked, &quot;are we going out there?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Finlayson asked if you and your colleagues would come first to see him and Mr. Black. The helicopter is ready to go any moment after that.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. Not this time, though. That section of the Brooks Range is like the mountains on the moon. Helicopter. We've been making a continuous check on the pump stations and the remote gate valves since this damned threat came through, and we'd stayed at Station Five last night. We were just approaching Four, a mile away, I'd reckon, when we saw this damned great explosion.&quot;</FONT><BR>

We'd just started looking when we heard shouting come from a store room. It was locked, naturally, but the key had been left in the lock. Poulson—he's the boss— came running out with his men. They had the extinguishers located and the fire out in three minutes. But it was too late for the two engineers inside— they'd come down the previous day from Prudhoe Bay to do a routine maintenance job on one of the turbines.&quot;</FONT><BR>

On the remote off-chance, I contacted Anchorage and asked them to alert every public and private airport and strip in the state. Also to have radio and TV stations ask the public to report hearing or sighting a helicopter in an unusual place. I haven't but one hope in ten thousand that the request will bring any results.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He grimaced. &quot;Most people never realize how huge this state is. It's bigger than half of Western Europe, but it's got a population of just over three hundred thousand, which is to say it's virtually uninhabited. Again, helicopters are an accepted fact of life in Alaska, and people pay no more attention to them than you would to a car in Texas. Third, we've still only got about three good hours of light, and the idea of carrying out an air search is laughable—anyway, we'd require fifty times the number of planes we have, and even then it would be sheer luck to find them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But, for the record, we did find out something unpleasant. In case anything should happen to the pump station, there's an emergency pipeline that can be switched in to bypass it. Our friends took care of that also. They blew up the control valve.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So there's going to be a massive oil spillage?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No chance. The line is loaded with thousands of sensors all the way from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, and any section of it can be closed down and isolated immediately. Even the repairs would normally present no problem. But neither metal nor men work too well in these abnormally low temperatures.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Apparently that doesn't apply to saboteurs,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;How many were there?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Poulson said two. Two others said three. The remainder weren't sure.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wonder if that's fair, Mr. Dermott. Poulson's a good man and he doesn't miss much.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Did he see their faces?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Masked?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. Their fur collars were pulled high up and their hats low down so that only their eyes were visible. You can't tell the color of a man's eyes in the darkness. Besides, our people had just been dragged from bed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But not the two engineers. They were working on the engines. How come at that very early hour?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bronowski spoke with restraint. &quot;Because they had been up all night. Because they were going home to their families in Fairbanks for their week's leave. And because I had arranged to pick them up there shortly after that time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Did Poulson or any of his friends recognize the voices?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If they had, I'd have the owners behind bars by this time. Their collars were up to their eyes. Of course their voices would have been muffled. You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Dermott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Dermott is a trained interrogator,&quot; Brady said cheerfully. &quot;Trained him myself, as a matter of fact. What happened after that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Poulson and his men were marched across to the food store and locked in there. We keep it locked because of bears. Unless bears are near starving, they aren't very partial to human beings, but they're partial indeed to all human goodies.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, Mr. Bronowski. One last question. Did Poulson or his men hear the fatal shots?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">silenced guns. That's the great advantage of those modern educational pictures, Mr. Dermott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was a pause in the questioning. Brady said, &quot;Because I am an acute observer of character, George, I can tell something's eating you. What's on your mind?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's only a thought. I'm wondering if the murderers are employees of the trans-Alaska pipeline.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The silence was brief but marked. Then Bron-owski said, &quot;This beats everything. I speak as Dr. Watson, you understand. I know that Sherlock Holmes could solve a crime without leaving his armchair, but I never knew of any cop or security man who could come up with the answer without at least visiting the scene of the crime.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said mildly, &quot;I'm not claiming to have solved anything. I'm just putting forward a possibility.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;What makes you even think that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In the first place, you pipeline people aren't just the biggest employer of labor around here... you're the <I>only </I>one. Where the hell else could the killers have come from? What else could they have been? Lonely trappers or prospectors on the North Slope or the Brooks Range in the depth of winter? They!d freeze to death the first day out. They wouldn't be prospectors, because the tundra is frozen solid, and beneath that there's two thousand feet of solid permafrost. As for trappers, they'd be not only cold and lonely, but very hungry, indeed, because they wouldn't find any form of food north of Brooks Range until the late spring comes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady grunted. &quot;What you're saying in effect is that the pipeline is the sole means of life-support in those parts.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a fact. Had this happened at Pump Station</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Seven or Eight, circumstances would have been quite different—those stations are only a hop, skip and jump from Fairbanks by car. But you don't take <I>a </I>car over the Brooks Range in the heart of winter. And you don't backpack over the Range at this time of year, unless you're bent on quick suicide. So the question remains, how did they get there and away again?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Helicopter,&quot; Bronowski said. &quot;Remember I said I thought I saw ski marks? Tim—Tim Houston—saw the marks too, although he was less sure. The others were frankly skeptical, but admitted the possibility. But I've been flying helicopters for as long as I can remember.&quot; Bronowski shook his head in exasperation. &quot;God's sake, how else could they have got in and out?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I thought,&quot; Mackenzie said, &quot;that those pump stations had limited-range radarscopes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They do.&quot; Bronowski shrugged. &quot;But snow plays funny tricks on radar. Also, they may not have been looking, or maybe they had the set switched off, not expecting company in such bad weather.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermbtt said, &quot;They were expecting you, surely.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not for another hour or so. We'd had deteriorating weather at Number Five, so we left ahead of schedule. Another thing—even if they had picked up an incoming helicopter, they'd automatically have assumed it was one of ours and would have had no reason to be suspicious.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Be that as it may,&quot; said Dermott, &quot;I'm convinced. It was an inside job. The killers are pipeline employees. The note announcing their intention of causing a slight spillage of oil seemed civil and civilized enough, with no hint of violence, but violence there has been. The saboteurs blundered,-and so they had to kill.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Blundered?&quot; Mackenzie was a lap behind.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. Bronowski said the key had been left in the storeroom door. Don't forget, all the engineers locked inside <I>were </I>engineers. With the minimum of equipment they could have either turned the key in the lock or slipped a piece of paper, cardboard, linoleum, anything, under the bottom of the door, pushed the key out to fall on it and hauled the key inside. Me, I'd have thrown that key a mile away. But the killers didn't. Their intention was to bring the two pump-house engineers to the storeroom and usher them in to join their friends, and lock them in, too. But they didn't do that either. Why? Because one of the saboteurs said or did something that betrayed their identity to the two engineers. They were recognized by the engineers, who evidently knew them well enough to penetrate their disguises. The saboteurs had no option, so they killed them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;How's that for a hypothesis, Sam?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bronowski was pondering his reply when the minibus pulled up outside the main entrance to the administrative building. Brady, predictably, was the first out and scuttled—as far as a nearly spherical human being could be said to scuttle-—to the welcoming shelter that lay behind the main door. The others followed more sedately.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">John Finlayson rose as they entered his room. He extended his hand to Brady and said, &quot;Delighted to meet you, sir.&quot; He nodded curtly toward Dermott, Mackenzie and Bronowski, then turned to a man seated to his right behind a table. &quot;Mr. Hamish Black, general manager, Alaska.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mr. Black didn't look like the general manager of anything, far less the manager of a tough and ruthless oil operation. The rolled umbrella and bowler hat were missing, but even without them his lean,</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">That such a man, who could hardly tell a nut from a bolt, should head up a huge industrial complex was not a new phenomenon. The tea boy who had painstakingly fought his way up through the ranks to boardroom level had become a man of no mean importance. It was Hamish Black, so adept at punching the keyboard of his pocket calculator, who called the industrial tune. It was rumored that his income ran into six figures—pounds Sterling, not dollars. His employers, evidently, thought he was worth every penny of it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He waited patiently while Finlayson made the introductions.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would not go as far as Mr. Finlayson and say I'm delighted to meet you.&quot; Black's smile was as thin as his face. His flat, precise, controlled voice belonged to the City—London's Wall Street—-just as surely as did his appearance. &quot;Under other circumstances, yes. Under these, I can only say that I'm glad you, Mr. Brady, and your colleagues are here. I assume Mr. Bronowski has supplied you with details. How did you propose we proceed?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't know. Do we have a glass?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The expression on Finlayson's face could have been interpreted as reluctant disapproval: Black, it seemed, didn't believe in using expressions. Brady produced, poured the inevitable daiquiri, waved the flask at the others, who waved it on and said, &quot;The FBI have been notified?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black nodded. &quot;Reluctantly.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There's a legal obligation to notify of any interruption of interstate commerce. Quite frankly, I don't see what they can achieve.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They're out at the pump station now?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They haven't arrived here yet. They're waiting for some specialist Army Ordnance officers to accompany them—experts on bombs, explosives and the like.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Waste of time. Among the people who built and run this line there are as good—if not better— explosives experts than in any Army Ordnance Corps. The killers wouldn't have left a trace of explosives at Pump Station Number Four.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If a silence can be said to be cold, the ensuing silence was downright chilly. Finlayson said stonily, &quot;Does that statement mean what I think it means?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I should imagine it does,&quot; said Brady. &quot;Explain, George.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott explained. When he had finished, Finlayson said, &quot;Preposterous. Why should any of our pipeline employees want to do a thing like that? It doesn't make sense.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's never a pleasant thing to nurture a viper in your bosom,&quot; Brady said agreeably. &quot;Mr. Black?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Makes sense to me, if only because no other immediate explanation occurs. What do <I>you </I>think, Mr. Brady?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Exactly what I was asking Mr. Bronowski as we touched down.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. Well.&quot; Bronowski didn't seem any too comfortable. &quot;I don't like it. An inside job is all too damn plausible. Point is, carry this line of thinking a little further and the finger points at Tim Houston and myself as the two prime suspects.&quot; Bronowski paused. &quot;Tim and I had a helicopter. We were in the right place at approximately the right time. We</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">know of a dozen ways to sabotage the pipeline. It's no secret that we're both pretty experienced in the use of explosives, so taking out Station Four would have presented no problem for us.&quot; He paused. &quot;But who's going to suspect the security chief and his number two?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Me, for one;&quot; said Brady. He sipped his drink and sighed. &quot;I'd have you clapped behind bars right now were it not for your impeccable record, lack of apparent motive and the fact that it's incredible that you should have acted in such a clumsy fashion.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not clumsy, Mr. Brady. The killers were stupid to the point of insanity... or badly frightened. The job certainly wasn't the work of professional hit men. Why shoot the two engineers? Why leave any evidence that murder had been done? Just knock them unconscious—a dozen ways that can be done without leaving a mark—then blow them to pieces along with the pump station. Act of God, and no hint of foul play.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Amateurism is a grievesome thing, is it not?&quot; Brady turned to Finlayson. &quot;Could we have a line to Anchorage, please? Thank you. Give him the number, then take the call, George.&quot; Dermott did so and within four minutes had hung up, his part of the conversation having been limited mainly to monosyllables.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wouldn't you know,&quot; Dermott said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No luck?&quot; said Mackenzie.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Too much. The Anchorage police have located not one but four hot phone booths. Suspicious characters either inside them or lurking in the vicinity, and this at that most ungodly hour. All four of them, dammit, with a disproportionate number of high-denomination coins inside them. All four have been dismantled and taken along to the cop shop. But they</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black said with sardonic restraint, &quot;The relevance of this call escapes me. It has something to do with Pump Station Four?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Brady. &quot;Maybe not. All we know for certain is that Sanmobil—the people who have the tar-sands concession north of Fort McMurray, in Alberta—have also received a threat against their oil production lines. Couched in almost identical terms with the threat you received, the only difference being that while yours arrived by mail, theirs came from a public phone booth in Anchorage. We're trying to trace which booth and, with any fingerprint luck, who the caller may have been.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black thought briefly, then said, &quot;Curious. A threat against Alaskan oil from Alberta, and one against Albertan oil from Alaska. Must tie up with Pump Station Four... the arm of coincidence isn't all that long. And while you're sitting here, Mr. Brady, some ill-intentioned person or persons may be planting an explosive device at some strategic point in Sanmobil's tar sands.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The thought had not escaped me. However, surmise and speculation will serve no point until we turn up one or two hard facts. We hope that one may even result from a close inspection of Pump Station Four. Coming out there, Mr. Black?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good heavens, no. I'm very much a desk-bound citizen. But I shall await your return with interest.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Three generator-fed arc lamps threw the half-demolished pump house and its shattered contents into harsh relief, glaring white and stygian blackness, with no intermediate shading between. Snow drifted silently down through the all-but-vanished roof, and a high wind blew a fine white cloud through a gaping hole in the northern wall. Already the combined effects of the two snows had softened and blurred the outlines of the machinery, but not sufficiently to conceal the fact that engines, motors, pumps and switch-gear had been either destroyed or severely damaged. Mercifully, the snow had already covered the two mounds that lay side by side before the mangled remains of a switchboard. Dermott looked slowly around with a face again as bleak as the scene that lay before him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Damage evenly spread,&quot; he said, &quot;so it couldn't have come from one central blast. Half-a-dozen charges, more likely.&quot; He turned to Poulson, the head man, a black-bearded man with bitter eyes. &quot;How many explosions did you hear?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Rubbish! You can't do a postmortem on a frozen body.&quot; Dermott stooped, began to clear away the snow from the nearest of the mounds, then looked up in surprise as a heavy hand clamped on his left • shoulder.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You deaf or something, mister?&quot; Poulson didn't sound truculent, just annoyed. &quot;I'm in charge here.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You were. Donald?''</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure.&quot; Mackenzie eased Poulson's hand away and said, &quot;Let's go talk to the head office man, Black, and hear what he has to say about obstructing murder investigations.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That won't be necessary, Mr. Mackenzie,&quot; Bronowski said. He nodded to Poulson. &quot;John's upset. Wouldn't you be?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Poulson hesitated briefly, turned and left the pump room. Dermott had most of the snow cleared away when he felt a light touch on his shoulder. It was Poulson again, proffering him, of all things, a long-handled clothes brush. Dermott took it, smiled his thanks and delicately brushed away the remaining snow.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bullet's lodged in the head,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Rifling marks on it should be of interest to the police ballistics department.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I suppose,&quot; Bronowski agreed reluctantly. &quot;But Alaska covers just over half a million square miles. I'm afraid optimism is not my long suit.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We're agreed there.&quot; They lowered the body to the ground and Dermott tried to unzip the shredded green parka, but it, too, was frozen. There was a slight crackling of ice as he eased the jacket away from the shirt beneath and peered into the gap between the two layers of clothing. He could see some documents, including a buff-colored envelope, tucked away in the inside right pocket. By sliding his hand in flat he tried to extract them with his fore and middle fingers, but because he could achieve so little grip, and because they seemed frozen—not only together but also to the side of the pocket—they proved impossible to move. Dermott straightened to an upright kneeling position, looked at the dead man thoughtfully, then up at Bronowski.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could we have the two bodies moved to someplace where they can be thawed out a bit? I can't examine them in this state, nor, by the same token, can the doctors carry out their postmortems.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;John?&quot; Bronowski looked at Poulson, who nodded, albeit with some reluctance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Another thing,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;What's the quickest way of clearing away the snow here from the floor and machinery?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">No time at all. Want me to fix it now? And the two men?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Please. Then there's a question or two I'd like to ask. In your living quarters, perhaps?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Straight across. Be with you in a few minutes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Outside, on their way, Mackenzie said, &quot;Your hound-dog instincts have been aroused. What gives?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dead man back there. Index finger on his right hand is broken.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That all? Wouldn't be surprised if half the bones in his body are broken.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could be. But this bone appears to have been broken in a rather peculiar fashion. Be able to tell better, later.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bronowski and Poulson joined them around the table of the comfortable kitchen living quarters. Poulson said, &quot;Okay, fixed. Snow in the pump room should be gone in fifteen minutes. About the two engineers—well, I wouldn't know.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Considerably longer,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Thanks. Now, then. Bronowski, Mackenzie and myself think it likely that the murderers were employees of the trans-Alaska pipeline. What would you think of that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Poulson glanced enquiringly at Bronowski, found no inspiration there, looked away and pondered. &quot;It figures,&quot; he said at last. &quot;The only living souls for ten thousand square miles around here— a hundred thousand as far as I know—are employed by the pipeline. More than that, while any mad bomber could have blown up the pump station, it took an oilman to know where to locate and destroy the bypass control valve.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We also theorize that the engineers—what were their names, by the way?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;James and James. Brothers.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We think that the bombers gave themselves away in one fashion or another, that the Jameses recognized them and had to be silenced for keeps. But you and your men didn't recognize them. That's for sure?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;For sure.&quot; Poulson smiled without much humor. &quot;If what you suppose is correct, it's just as well for us that we didn't. But then it's not surprising that we didn't. Don't forget that up here in Number Four we're no better than hermits living on a desert island. The only time we see anybody is when we go on leave every few weeks. Traveling maintenance engineers like the Jameses—or, come to that, Mr. Bronowski here—see ten times as many people as we do, and so are likely to recognize ten times as many people. Which makes your idea that it was an inside job all the more likely.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You and your men are certain there wasn't the remotest peculiarity about them, either in speech or dress, that struck a chord?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're flogging a dead horse, Dermott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I suppose. There's a possibility that those saboteurs came by helicopter.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Damned if I can see how else they could have come. Mr. Bronowski here thought he saw skid marks. I wasn't sure one way or another. It was a bad night for being sure of anything... dark, with a strong wind and drifting snow. Circumstances like that, you can imagine almost anything.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You didn't <I>hear </I>this helicopter approaching— or imagine you heard it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We heard nothing. Don't forget we were all asleep and—&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">screen night and day. Then, because of the extremely heavy insulation, it's difficult for any sound to penetrate from outside. The generator running next door doesn't help much either. Finally, of course, the wind was blowing—as it still is—almost directly from the north and would have carried away the sound of any craft approaching from the opposite direction. I know that a helicopter is one of the most rackety bits of machinery in existence but—<I>-even </I>though we were wide awake then—we didn't hear Mr. Bronowski's chopper coming in from the south. Sorry, that's all I can tell you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How long will it take to repair the pump room?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A few days, a week. I'm not sure. We'll need new engines, switchgear, pipelines, a mobile crane and a bulldozer. All those we already have at Prud-hoe except the engines, and I expect a Here will fly those in this evening. Then a chopper or two can fly the stuff out here. The repair crews will be on the job in the morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So a week before the oil starts flowing again?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no. Tomorrow, with luck. The bypass control valve is not a major repair job... parts replacement mainly.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;You might look at all this as just a minor disruption?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Technically, yes. The ghosts of the James brothers might see it differently. Want to look at the pump room now? Most of the stuff should have melted by this time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The snow in the pump room had gone, and the atmosphere was warm and humid. Without the protective white covering, the scene was more repellent than before, the extent of the devastation more clearly and dishearteningly evident, and the stench</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After ten minutes Poulson said curiously, &quot;What <I>are </I>you looking for?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll let you know when I find it,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Meantime, I haven't a clue.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In that case, can I join in the search?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure. Don't touch or turn anything over. The FBI wouldn't like it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ten minutes later, Dermott straightened and switched off his light. &quot;That's it, then, gentlemen. If you've found no more than I have, among the four of us we've found nothing. Looks as if fire or blasts have wiped the platter clean. Let's have a look at the James brothers. They should be in a fairly ex-aminable state by now.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They were. Dermott moved first to the man he'd looked at in the pump room. This time the zip on the green parka unfastened easily. The blast effect that had shredded the parka had not penetrated it, for the plaid shirt beneath bore no signs of damage. Dermott removed some papers, cards and envelopes from the inside right pocket of the jacket, leafed through and replaced them. He then lifted both charred wrists, examined them and the hands in an apparently cursory fashion and lowered them again. He repeated the process with the other victim, then rose to his feet. Poulson bent a quizzical eye on him.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Clues,&quot; Mackenzie said into Dermott's ear, not from any wish for privacy but simply to make himself heard. &quot;Man can't move around without tripping over them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None in the pump room, that's sure. Place had been pretty comprehensively quartered before we ever got there. Almost certainly before the snow had started to cover anything.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The old fine-tooth comb is what I mean.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And/or. Who else?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps there was nothing to find?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said—or rather shouted, &quot;That dead man's forefinger had been deliberately broken. Bent in at forty-five degrees toward the thumb. Never seen anything like it before.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Freak accident.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;'Odd' is better. Something else odd, too. When I searched him first there was a buff envelope in his inner pocket. I was unable to get it out.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But you were when you unzipped it later?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;All very curious,&quot; Mackenzie said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jim Brady was of the same opinion. After reporting the results of their investigation, Dermott and Mackenzie had retired with him to the room he'd been allocated for the night.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Why didn't you mention those things to Black and Finlayson? Those are hard facts—an oddly broken finger, a missing envelope?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hard facts? There's only my word for it. I've no idea what was in the envelope anyway, and although I'd say the forefinger had been deliberately broken, I'm no osteologist.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But no harm in mentioning those things, surely?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bronowski and Houston were there too.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You really don't trust anyone, do you, George?&quot; Brady's tone was admiring, not reproachful.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As you never fail to remind people, sir, you taught me yourself.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;True, true,&quot; Brady said complacently. &quot;Very well, then, have them up. I'll do my Olympian act while you ply them with questions and strong drink.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott spoke on the phone and within a minute Bronowski and Houston had knocked, entered and taken seats.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Kind, gentlemen, kind.&quot; Brady was at his most avuncular. &quot;Long day, I know, and you must be damnably tired. But we're babes in the wood up here. We're not only <I>short </I>of necessary information, we're totally devoid of it, and we believe you two gentlemen are those best equipped to supply us with that information. But I forget myself, gentlemen. I suggest a pre-inquisitional restorative.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;What Mr. Brady means is a drink.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's what I said. You gentlemen like scotch?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Off-duty, yes. But you know the company regulations, sir, and how strictly Mr. Finlayson interprets those.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Strict? I am ironclad in the interpretation of my own regulations.&quot; The wave of Brady's arm was,</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">indeed, Olympian. &quot;You are off-duty. Off regular duty, anyhow. George, refreshments. Mr. Dermott will ask the questions, alternating, I do not doubt, with Mr. Mackenzie. You gentlemen, if you will be so kind, will fill in the gaps in our knowledge.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He took his daiquiri from Dermott, savored it, laid down his glass, relaxed in his chair and steepled his hands under his chin. &quot;I shall but listen and evaluate.&quot; Nobody was left with any doubt as to which was the most demanding task of the three. &quot;Health, gentlemen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bronowski lifted his own glass, which he had accepted with no great show of reluctance. &quot;And confusion to our enemies.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;That's precisely the point. The enemy aren't confused. We are. The taking out of Pump Station Four is only the opening skirmish in what promises to be a bloody battle. They—the enemy—know where they're going to hit again. We have not the vaguest idea. But you must have—by the very nature of your job you must be more aware of the points most vulnerable to attack than anyone else between Prudhoe Bay and Valdez. Take off your security hats and put on those of the enemy. Where would <I>you </I>strike next?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jesus!&quot; Bronowski fortified himself with some of Brady's malt. &quot;That's more than a sixty-four-dollar question. It's an eight-hundred-mile question— and every damned mile is virtually a sitting target.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The boss is right,&quot; Tim Houston said. &quot;If we sit here and drink your whiskey while pretending to help, we're only abusing your hospitality. There's nothing we or anyone else can do to help. A combat-ready division of the U. S. Army would be about as useful as a gaggle of Girl Scouts. The task is impossible and the line indefensible.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;Well, George, at least we're operating on a bigger scale than with the tar-sands boys in Athabasca. There they said a battalion wouldn't be big enough to guard their installation. Now it's a division.&quot; Mackenzie turned to Bronowski. &quot;Let's switch hats with the enemy. Where <I>wouldn't </I>you strike next?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bronowski said, &quot;Well, I wouldn't strike at any of the pump stations again on the assumption that, until this matter is cleared up, they will be heavily guarded. I'd have been sorely tempted to go for Pump Station Ten at the Isabel Pass in the Alaska Range, or Number Twelve at the Thompson Pass in the Chu-gach Mountains. All pump stations are vital of course, but some are more vital than others, and those are Number Ten and Number Twelve—along with Number Four here.&quot; He considered briefly. &quot;Or maybe I <I>would </I>go for them... I mean, maybe you'd be so damned certain that I wouldn't hit again in the same place that you wouldn't much bother—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott held up his hand. &quot;Start in on the double-guessing, and we're up all night. On with the hazards—the low priority ones, I mean.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wouldn't go for the two Master Operations Control Centers at Prudhoe Bay. They could be taken out easily enough and, sure, they'd stall all production from the wells immediately, but not for long. It's no secret that contingency plans for bypassing the centers are already in hand. Repairs wouldn't take all that long. In any event, security will be now tightened to the extent that the game wouldn't be worth the candle. So we can be pretty certain that there will be no attempt made to sabotage the oil supply before it enters the pipeline. Same goes for when it leaves the pipe at Valdez. Maximum damage there could be inflicted at the Oil</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Movements Control Center, where the pipeline controller can monitor and control the flow of oil all the way from Prudhoe to Valdez, and the terminal controller—he's in the same room, actually—controls practically everything that moves in the terminal itself. Both of those, in turn, are dependent on what's called the Backbone Supervisory System Computer. Knock out any of those three and you're in dead trouble. But they're pretty secure as they are. From now, they'll be virtually impregnable. Again, not worth it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;How about the storage tanks?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, now. If one or two of them were attacked or ruptured—it would be impossible to get them all at once—the containment dikes would take care of the spillage. Fire would be another thing, but even then the snow would have a blanketing effect—we may only have an annual dusting of snow up here, but down there they have over three hundred inches. Anyway, the tank farms are the most open and easily guarded complex on the entire pipeline. There's no way you can really get at them without bombing the area. Not very likely, one would think.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What about the tanker terminals?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Again, easily guarded. I hardly think they're likely to run to underwater demolition squads. Even if they did, they couldn't do much damage, and that would be easily repaired.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The tankers themselves?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sink a dozen and there's always a thirteenth. No way you can interrupt the oil flow by hitting the tankers.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Valdez Narrows?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Block them?&quot; Dermott nodded and Bronowski shook his head. &quot;The Narrows aren't as narrow as they look on a small-scale chart. Three thousand</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So we cross off the unlikely targets. Where does that leave us?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It leaves us with eight hundred miles.&quot; Bron-owski shifted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The air temperature is the overriding factor,&quot; Houston said. &quot;No saboteur worth his salt would consider wrecking anything except the pipeline itself. This time of the year any attack has to be in the -open air.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This is only early February, remember, and to all intents we're still in the depth of winter. As often as not the temperature is well on the wrong side of thirty below, and in these parts thirty below is the crucial figure. Rupture the pipeline at, say, thirty-five below, and it stays ruptured. Repair is virtually impossible. Men can work, although well below their norm, but unfortunately the metal they may try to repair or the machine tools they use to make the repairs won't co-operate with them. At extreme temperatures, profound molecular changes occur in metal and it becomes unworkable. Given the right—or wrong—conditions, a tap on an iron rod will shatter it like glass.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;You mean, all I need is a hammer and a few taps on the pipeline—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Houston was patient. &quot;Not quite. What with the heat of the oil inside and the insulation lagging outside, the steel of the pipeline is always warm and malleable. It's the repair tools that would fracture.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;But surely it would be possible to erect canvas or tarpaulin covers over the fracture and bring the temperature up to workable levels by</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">using hot-air blowers? You know, the way Poulson did at Station Four?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course. Which is why I wouldn't attack the pipeline directly. I'd attack the structures that support the pipeline, those that are already frozen solid at air temperature and would require days, perhaps weeks, to bring up to a working temperature.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Structures?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Indeed. The terrain between Prudhoe and Val-dez is desperately uneven and traversed with innumerable watercourses which have to be forded or spanned in one way or another. There are over six hundred streams and rivers along the run. The six-hundred-fifty-foot free-span suspension bridge over the Tazlina River would make a dilly of a target. Even better would be the twelve-hundred-foot span— a similar type of construction—over the Tanana River. But one doesn't even have to operate on such a grandiose scale, and I, personally, would prefer not to.&quot; He looked at Bronowski. &quot;Wouldn't you agree?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Completely. Operate on a much more moderate and undramatic scale, but one equally effective. I'd go for the VSMs every time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;VSMs?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Vertical support members. Roughly half the length of the pipeline is above ground and lies on a horizontal cradle or saddle supported by vertical metal posts. That makes for a fair number of targets—seventy-eight thousand of them, to be precise. They would be a snap to take out—wrap-around beehive plastic explosives which would need all of a minute to fix in position. Take out twenty of those, and the line would collapse under its own weight and the weight of the oil inside it. Take weeks to repair.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They could still use those hot-air canvas shelters.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A hell of a lot of help that would be,&quot; Bron-owski said, &quot;if they couldn't bring up the cranes and crawler equipment to effect the repairs. Anyway, there are places where, at this time of year, it just couldn't be done. There is, for instance, one particularly vulnerable stretch that gave the designers headaches, the builders sleepless nights and security nightmares. This steep and dangerous stretch is between Pump Station Five and the summit of Atigun Pass, which is between four and five thousand feet high.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Houston said, &quot;Four thousand seven hundred and seventy-five feet.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Four thousand seven hundred and seventy-five feet. In a run of a hundred miles from the pass the pipe comes down to twelve hundred feet, which is quite a drop.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;With a corresponding amount of built-up pressure?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's not the problem. In the event of a break in the line, a special computer linkage between Four and Five will automatically shut down the pumps in Four and close every remote valve between the stations. The fail-safe procedures are highly sophisticated, and they work. At the very worst the spillage could be restricted to fifty thousand barrels. But the point is, in winter the line couldn't be repaired.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady coughed apologetically and descended from his Olympian heights.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So a break in this particular section, about now, could immobilize the line for weeks on end?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No question.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then forget it.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The burdens I have to bear alone,&quot; Brady sighed. &quot;Let me have men about me who can think. I begin to understand why I am what I am. I find it extraordinary that the construction company never carried out any tests to discover what happens to the viscosity of oil in low temperatures. Why didn't they seal off a couple of hundred feet of experimental pipe with oil inside it and see how long it would take before it gummed up to the extent that it would cease to flow?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Never occurred to them, I suppose,&quot; Bronowski said. &quot;An eventuality that would never arise.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It has arisen. An estimate of three weeks has been bandied about. Based on scientific calculations, one assumes?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bronowski said, &quot;I wouldn't know. Not my field. Maybe Mr. Black or Mr. Finlayson would know.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Black knows nothing about oil, and I doubt whether Mr. Finlayson or any other professional oilman on the line has anything but the vaguest idea. Could be ten days. Could be thirty. You take my point, George?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. Blackmail, threats, extortion, some positive and very material advantages to be gained. Interruption is one thing, cessation another. They require a lever, a bargaining counter. Close down the line completely, and the oil companies would laugh at their threats, for then they would have nothing to lose. The bargaining arm would have gone. The kidnapper can't very well hold a kidnappee for ransom if it's known that the kidnappee is dead.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I question if I could have put it better myself,&quot; Brady said. He had about him an air of magnanimous self-satisfaction. &quot;We are, clearly, not dealing with clowns. Our friends would have taken such im-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am now. But when I was talking about hazards, I wasn't taking that side of it into account.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know you weren't. Nobody was. Well, I think that will do, gentlemen. We appear to have established two things. It is unlikely that any attack will be carried out on any major installation—that is Prudhoe, Valdez or the intervening twelve major pump stations. It is further unlikely that any attack will be carried out in regions so inaccessible that repairs may be impossible for weeks on end.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So we're left with the likelihood that any further sabotage will take the form of attacks on accessible stretches of VSMs or the taking out of minor bridges—the possibility of destroying the Tazlina or Tanana bridges is remote, as those could well take weeks to repair. We may not have come up with too much, but at least we have clarified matters and established some sort of system of priorities.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Not without difficulty Brady heaved himself to his feet to indicate that the interview was over. &quot;Thank you, gentlemen, both for your time and information. I'll see you in the morning—at, of course, a reasonably Christian hour.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The door closed behind Bronowski and Houston. Brady asked, &quot;Well, what did you make of that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;As you said, just a limitation of possibilities, which, unfortunately, still remain practically limitless. Three things I'd like to do. First, I'd like the FBI or whoever to carry out a rigorous investigation into the pasts of Poulson and his pals at Pump Station Four.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have reason to suspect them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not really. But I've an odd feeling. Something is wrong at Number Four. Don shares my feeling,</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">but there's nothing we can put a finger on except that buff envelope that was missing from the dead engineer's pocket. Even with that I'm beginning to question whether my eyes or imagination were playing tricks on me. The lighting was damned harsh, and I could have got my colors wrong. No matter— as you'd be the first to agree, every pipeline employee is a suspect until his innocence is established.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You bet. You said Poulson and Bronowski seemed on pretty cordial terms?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bronowski is the sort of character who seems on pretty cordial terms with everyone. If you're suggesting what I think you are, I might mention that according to Finlayson there have been three security checks carried out on Bronowski.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And passed with flying colors, no doubt. What does Finlayson know about security checks and how to evaluate them? Has he any guarantee that none of those three professedly unbiased investigators was not, in fact, a bosom friend of Bronowski? Now, / have a very good and very discreet friend in New York. As you say yourself, every pipeline operator is as guilty as hell until proved otherwise.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I didn't quite say that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hair-splitting. The second thing?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'd like a medical opinion, preferably that of a doctor with some osteopathetic knowledge, on how the dead engineer's finger came to be broken.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How can that help?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How should I know?&quot; Dermott sounded almost irritable. &quot;God knows, Jim, you've emphasized often enough never to overlook anything that seems odd.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;True, true,&quot; Brady said pacifically. &quot;There was a third matter?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The telephone rang. Brady picked it up, listened briefly, scowled and handed the phone over to Dermott. &quot;For you.&quot; Dermott lifted an eyebrow. &quot;It's that damnable code again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott gave him a familiar look, put the phone to his ear, reached for a pad and started to take notes. After barely a minute he hung up and said, &quot;And now? That was your last question, wasn't it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What? Yes. So?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And now it's back to the old jet and heigh-ho for Canada.&quot; Dermott gave Brady an encouraging smile. &quot;Should be all right, sir. Still plenty of daiquiris in your airborne bar.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What the devil is that meant to mean?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just this, sir.&quot; Dermott's smile had gone. &quot;You will recall our three brilliant minds sitting around in Sanmobil's office and coming to the unanimous conclusion that there were six points vulnerable to attack—the draglines, the bucket wheels, the reclaimers' bridges, the separator plates, the radial stackers and, above all, the conveyor belting? Some joker up there obviously didn't see it our way at all. He's taken out the main processing plant.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">Six</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Four hours later the Brady Enterprises team stood shivering in Sanmobil's sabotaged processing plant at Athabasca. Brady himself was enveloped in his usual cocoon of coats and scarves, his temper not improved by the fact that the flight from Alaska had deprived him of dinner.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How did it <I>happen?&quot; </I>he repeated. &quot;Here we have an easily patrolled area, brilliantly lit, as you pointed out yourself, and staffed with one hundred per cent—I beg your pardon, ninety-eight per cent-loyal and patriotic Canadians.&quot; He peered through a large hole that had been blown in a cylindrical container. &quot;How can such things be?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't think that's quite fair, Mr. Brady.&quot; Bill Reynolds, the fair-haired and ruddy-faced operations manager, spoke up for his colleague Terry Brinck-man, the security chief at whom Brady's remarks had been directed. &quot;Terry had only eight men on duty last night—and that was his second shift of the day. In other words, he himself had been continuously on duty for fifteen hours when this incident occurred. You can see how hard he was trying.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Reynolds went on, &quot;You remember we had all agreed on the priorities—the areas most liable to attack. Those were the places that Terry and his men were doing their best to protect—which didn't leave any men for patrolling the plant itself. You will recall, Mr. Brady, that you were in complete agreement. You also said Terry had nothing to reproach himself with. If we're going to apportion blame, let's not forget ourselves.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nobody's blaming anybody, Mr. Reynolds. How extensive is the damage?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Enough. Terry and I figure that these guys let off three charges here—that's the gas-oil hydrotrea-ter—and the same number next door at the Naptha hydrotreater. In fact, we've been extremely lucky— we could have had gas explosions and fuel fires. We had none. As it is, damage is comparatively slight. We should be on stream again in forty-eight hours.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Meantime, everything is shut down?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not the draglines. But the rest is. The radial stackers are full.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One of the plant operatives, you think?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brinckman said, &quot;I'm afraid we're sure. It's a big plant but it takes surprisingly few people to operate it, and everybody on a shift knows everybody else.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who normally holds the keys?&quot; Dermott asked.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One I keep permanently,&quot; Brinckman explained. &quot;The other goes to the security supervisor for the night shift, who passes it on to the person in charge of the morning and afternoon shifts.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who are those other security shift supervisors?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brinckman said, &quot;My number two, Jorgensen— this is his shift, really—and Napier. I don't think that any of the three of us is much given to stealing explosives, Mr. Dermott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not unless you're certifiable. Now, it seems unlikely anyone would risk abstracting keys and having copies made. Not only would they be too likely to be missed, but there's also more than a fair chance that we could trace the key cutter and so the thief.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There could be illegal key cutters.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I still doubt the keys would have been taken. Much more likely someone took an impression. That would need seconds only. And that's where the illegal side would come in—no straight key cutter would touch an impression. How easy would it be for anyone to get hold of the keys, even briefly?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;Everybody's got to sleep.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You take your belt off then, don't you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>104</B></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure.&quot; Brinckman shrugged. &quot;And if you're going to ask me next if I'm a heavy sleeper, well, yes, I am. And if you're going to ask me if it would have been possible for anyone to sneak into my room while I was asleep, borrow my key for a couple of minutes and return it unseen, well, yes that would have been perfectly possible too.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This,&quot; Brady said, &quot;is not going to take us very far. Sticky-fingered characters with an affinity for keys are legion. Would there have been <I>any </I>security man in this area tonight?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jorgensen would know,&quot; Brinckman said. &quot;Shall I get him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Won't he be out patrolling sixteen miles of conveyor belting or something?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's in the canteen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But surely he's in charge—on duty?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In charge of what, Mr. Brady? There are four men keeping an eye on the four draglines. The rest of the plant is closed down. We think it unlikely that this bomber will strike again tonight.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not much is unlikely.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bring him along to my office,&quot; Reynolds said. Brinckman left. &quot;I think you'll find it warmer and more comfortable there, Mr. Brady.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They followed Reynolds to the office block, through an external room where a bright-eyed and pretty young woman at the desk gave them a charming smile, and on into Reynolds' office where Brady began divesting himself of several outer layers of clothing even before Reynolds had the door closed. Reynolds took his chair behind the desk while Brady sank wearily into the only armchair in the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Reynolds said, &quot;Sorry to drag you all over the northwest like this. No sleep, no food, jet lags, all very upsetting. In the circumstances, I feel entitled</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                      </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">105</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">to bend company regulations. Come to think of it, I'm the only person in Sanmobile who can. A refreshment would be in order?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ha!&quot; Brady pondered. &quot;Early in the morning. Not only no dinner but no breakfast either.&quot; A hopeful look crept into his eye. &quot;Daiquiri?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But I thought you always—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We had an unfortunate experience over the Yukon,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;We ran out.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady scowled. Reynolds smiled. &quot;No daiquiris here. But a really excellent twelve-year-old malt.&quot; A few seconds later Brady lowered his half-tumbler and nodded appreciatively.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A close second. Now you two&quot;—this to Dermott and Mackenzie—&quot;I've done all the work so far.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Not even the shadow of a smile touched Mackenzie's face. &quot;Three questions, if I may. Who suggested checking up on the amount of explosives in the blasting shed?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nobody. Terry Brinckman did it right off the bat. We have a meticulous checking system and an easy one. The tally sheet's kept up to date twice a day. We just count the numbers of each particular type of explosive, subtract that number from the latest entry on the tally sheet, and that's the number that's been issued that day. Or stolen, as the case may be.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, that's certainly a mark in favor of your security chief.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have reservations about him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good heavens no. Why on earth should I? Number two—where do you hang up your keys at night?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't.&quot; He nodded toward a massive safe in a corner. &quot;Kept there day and night.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah! In that case I'll have to rephrase what was</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">going to be my third question. You are the only person with a key to that safe?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There's one more key. Corinne has it.&quot; &quot;Ah. That lovely lassie in the outer office?&quot; &quot;That, as you say, lovely lassie in the outer office, is my secretary.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And why does <I>she </I>have a key?&quot; &quot;Various reasons. All big companies, as you must know, have their codes. We're no exception. Code books are kept there. Corinne's my coding expert. Also, I can't be here all the time. Underman-agers, accountants, our legal people and the security chief all have access to the safe. I can assure you the safe contains items of vastly more importance than the keys to the blasting shed. Nothing has ever been missing yet.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;People just walk in, help themselves and walk out?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Reynolds lifted his eyebrows and looked hard at Mackenzie. &quot;Not quite. We are security conscious to a degree. They have to sign in, show Corinne what they've taken and sign out again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A couple of keys in a trouser pocket?&quot; &quot;Of course she doesn't search them. There has to be a certain amount of trust at executive levels.&quot; &quot;Yes. Could we have her in, do you think?&quot; Reynolds spoke into the bpx on his desk. Corinne entered looking good standing up, in her khaki cord Levi's and nicely distorted plaid shirt, a person with a smile for everyone. Reynolds said, &quot;You know who those gentlemen are, Corinne?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir. I think everybody does.&quot; &quot;I think Mr. Mackenzie here would like to ask you some questions.&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;How long have you been with Mr. Reynolds?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">107</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just over two years.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Before that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I came straight from secretarial school.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have a pretty sensitive and responsible position here?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She smiled again, but this time a little uncertainly, as if unsure where the questions were leading. &quot;Mr. Reynolds lists me as his confidential secretary.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;May I ask how old you are?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Twenty-two.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You must be the youngest confidential secretary of any big corporation I've ever come across.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This time she caught her lip and glanced at Reynolds, who was leaning back in his chair, hands clasped lazily behind his neck, with the air of a man who was almost enjoying himself. He smiled and said, &quot;Mr. Mackenzie is an industrial sabotage investigator. He has a job to do, and asking questions is part of that job. I know he's just made a statement, not asked a question, but it's one of those statements that expects comment.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She turned back to Mackenzie, with a swing of her long chestnut hair. &quot;I suppose I've been pretty lucky at that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She spoke with marked coolness, and Mackenzie felt it. &quot;None of my questions are directed against you, Corinne, okay? Now, you must know the executive-level people pretty well?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can hardly help it. They all come through me to get to Mr. Reynolds.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Including those who have business with that safe there?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course. I know them all well.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;All good friends, I take it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well&quot;—she smiled, but the smile had an edge</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">1O8</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">to it—&quot;lots of them are much too senior to be my friends.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But on good terms, shall we say?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes.&quot; She smiled again. &quot;I don't think I've made any enemies.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perish the thought!&quot; This came from George Dermott, who took over the questioning on a brisker note. &quot;Any of the people using the safe ever give you trouble? Like trying to take away what they shouldn't?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not often, and then it's only absentminded-ness or because they haven't studied the classified list. And surely, Mr. Dermott, if anyone wanted to get something past me they'd hide it in their clothing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott nodded. &quot;That's true. Miss Delorme.&quot; The girl was inspecting his rough-and-ready good looks with a spark of humor in her eye, as if amused by his blunt approach. He caught the expression and, in his turn, watched her for <I>a </I>reflective moment. &quot;What do you think now?&quot; he asked her. &quot;Do you think anyone might have smuggled something past you out of the safe?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She looked him in the eye. &quot;They might,&quot; she said, &quot;but I doubt it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could I have a list of the people who used the safe in the past four or five days?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly.&quot; She left and returned with a sheet which Dermott studied briefly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good Lord! The safe appears to be the Mecca for half of Sanmobil. Twenty entries at least in the last four days.&quot; He looked up at the girl. &quot;This is a carbon. May I keep it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Corinne Delorme smiled at the room in general,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">109</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">but the blue eyes came back to Dermott before she went out.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Charming indeed,&quot; said Brady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Plenty of spunk,&quot; Mackenzie said ruefully. &quot;She built a whole generation gap between you and ,me, George.&quot; He frowned. &quot;What gave you the idea . her name was Delorme?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There was a plaque on her desk. 'Corinne Delorme,' it said.&quot; Dermott shook his head. &quot;Hawkeye Mackenzie,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The other men laughed. Some of the tension that had grown in the room during the questioning of the girl fell away again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well. Anything more I can do for you?&quot; Reynolds asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Yes, please. Could we have a list of the names of your security staff?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Reynolds bent over the intercom and spoke to Corinne. He had just finished when Brinckman arrived accompanied by a tall, red-haired man whom he introduced as Carl Jorgensen.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;You were in charge of the night security shift, I understand. Were you around the sabotaged area at all tonight?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Several times.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So often? I thought you would have been concentrating on what we regarded—mistakenly—as the more vulnerable areas.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I went around them a couple of times, but by jeep only. But I had this funny feeling that we might have been guarding the wrong places. Don't ask me why.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your funny feeling didn't turn out to be so funny after all. Anything off-beat? Anything to arouse suspicion?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing. I know everybody on the night shift</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">110</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">and I know where they work. Nobody there that shouldn't have been there, nobody in any place that he hadn't any right to be.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You've got a key to the blasting shed. Where do you keep it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Terry Brinckman mentioned this. I have it only during my tour of duty and then I hand it over. I always carry it in the same button-down pocket on my shirt.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could anybody get at it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nobody except a professional pickpocket, and even then I'd know.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The two security men left and Corinne came in with a sheet of paper. Reynolds said, &quot;That was quick.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not really. They were typed out ages ago.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said to the girl, &quot;You must come and meet my daughter, Stella. I'm sure you'd get on. Both the same age. Stella is very like you, actually.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, Mr. Brady. I think I'd like that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll have her call you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When she had gone, Dermott said, &quot;What do you mean, like your daughter? I've never seen anyone less like Stella.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dancing eyes, my boy, dancing eyes. One must learn to probe beneath the surface.&quot; Brady heaved himself to his feet. &quot;The years creep on. Breakfast and bed. I'm through detecting for the day. It's tougher than capping fires.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott drove the rented car back to the hotel, Mackenzie sitting beside him. Brady took his ease across the entire width of the back seat. He said, &quot;I'm afraid I wasn't quite leveling with Reynolds</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">111</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">there. Breakfast, yes. But it'll be some hours before I—we—retire. I have come up with a plan.&quot; He paused.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said courteously, &quot;We're listening.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think I'll do some listening first. Why do you think I employ you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's a fair question,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;Why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To investigate, to detect, to think, to plot, to scheme, to plan.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;All at once?&quot; Mackenzie said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady ignored him. &quot;I don't want to come up with a proposal and then, if it goes wrong, have to spend the rest of my days listening to your carping reproaches. I'd like you two to come up with an idea and then if it's a lemon we can all share the blame. Incidentally, Donald, I take it you have your bug-box with you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The electronic eavesdropping locator-detector?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's what I said.&quot; • &quot;Yes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Splendid. Now, George, let's have your reading of the situation.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My reading of the situation is that for all the good we're doing we haven't a hope in hell of stopping the bad guys from doing exactly what they want and when they want. There is no way to forestall attacks on Sanmobil or the Alaska pipeline. They're calling the shots and we're the sitting ducks, if you'll pardon the mixing of the metaphors. They call the tune and we dance to it. They're active, we're passive. They're offensive, we're defensive. If we have any tactics, I'd say it's time we changed them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Go on,&quot; his leader urged him from behind.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If that's meant to sound encouraging,&quot; Dermott said, &quot;I don't know why. But how's this for a</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">positive thought? Instead of letting them keep us off-balance, why don't we keep them off-balance? Instead of their harassing us, let us harass them.&quot;.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Go on, go on,&quot; the back seat exhorted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let's attack them and put them on the defensive. Let <I>them </I>start worrying, instead of us.&quot; He paused. &quot;I see things as through a glass darkly, but I say plant a light at the end of the tunnel. What we'll do is, we'll provoke them. Provoke a reaction. Provoke the hell out of them. We'll hang it on this one factor: Our own pasts, our backgrounds, can be probed until the cows come home, and nothing will be turned up. But you can say <I>that </I>about how many people in a hundred?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott twisted his head briefly to locate a peculiar noise from the back of the car. Brady was actually rubbing his hands together. &quot;Well, Donald, what's your reading of it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Simple enough when you see it,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;All you have to do is to antagonize anywhere between sixty and eighty people to hell and back again. Investigate them as openly as possible. Deploy maximum indiscretion.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady beamed. &quot;What sixty to eighty people do . we investigate?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In Alaska <I>all </I>the security agents. Here, the security agents again, plus everybody who's had access to Reynolds' safe in the past few days. Going to include Reynolds himself?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good heavens, no.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said inconsequentially, &quot;She <I>is </I>a lovely girl.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady looked aloof. Mackenzie asked him, &quot;Do you really expect to find your panjandrum among that lot?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Panjandrum?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                      </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">113</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The prime mover. Mr. Big. Messrs. Big.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not for a moment. But if there's a rotten apple in the barrel, he may well find him for us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;Right. So we get all their names and past histories. Later on—sooner rather than later—we'll have the lot fingerprinted. Sure, they're going to stand on their civic rights and yell blue murder, and that will please you no end—refusal to co-operate will point the finger of suspicion at the refusee, if that's the word I want. Then you feed the information to your investigators in Houston, Washington and New York. Cost no object, urgency desperate. Not that you'll care a damn whether the investigators come up with anything or not. All that matters is that the suspects get to hear such inquiries are under way. That's all the provocation they'll need.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What kind of reactions do we expect to provoke?&quot; Dermott asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Unpleasant ones, I should hope. For the villains, I mean.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The first thing I'd do,&quot; Dermott told Brady, &quot;is send your family back to Houston. Jean and Stella could really become a liability. The scheme might rebound on you. Can't you see the word coming through—lay off, Brady, or something unpleasant's going to happen to your family? These people are playing for high stakes. They've killed once, they won't hesitate to kill again. They can't be hung twice.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Same thought occurred to me.&quot; Mackenzie turned to face the back seat. &quot;Either get the girls right back home, or have the RCMP protect them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hell—I <I>need </I>them!&quot; Brady sat forward with indignation. &quot;Number one, I have to be looked after.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Number two, Stella's handling the Ekofisk business for me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ekofisk?&quot; Dermott almost turned backward. &quot;What's that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Big fire in the North Sea, Norwegian half. Started after you'd come north. We have a team going in there today.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, okay,&quot; Dermott gave way a little. &quot;So you have to keep in touch. But why not work through the locals? That brunette of Reynolds'—Corinne. She could field calls for you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What happens when we go back to Alaska?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Use somebody up there. Finlayson's got a secretary—must have.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No substitute for the personal touch,&quot; said Brady magisterially. He sank in the seat as though the argument were over.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His two heavyweights turned forward again with an exchange of looks. Having been through all this a hundred times before, they knew that further pressure would be useless for the moment. Wherever he went, Brady maintained the fiction that his wife and daughter were part of his essential life-support system, and he kept them with him regardless of the expense. Or danger.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">Seven</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Not that Dermott and Mackenzie in the least minded having Jean and Stella around. Like mother, like daughter: whereas Jean was a strikingly handsome woman in her middle-forties, with that lovely, naturally blond hair and intelligent gray eyes, Stella looked the spittin' image of her mother, only younger, and even livelier, with, as her father was so fond of claiming, dancing eyes.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The men found Jean awaiting their return in the lounge bar of the Peter Pond Hotel. Tall and elegant, she advanced to meet them with her usual expression of tolerant, kindly amusement*. This look, Dermott knew from experience, reflected her genuine feelings: An equable temperament was no small advantage for someone who had to spend her life humoring Jim Brady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hi, honey!&quot; He reached up slightly to kiss her on the forehead. &quot;Where's Stella?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In your room. She's got some messages for you—been pretty busy on the phone.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Excuse me, then, gentlemen. Maybe one of you would be so kind as to buy my wife a drink.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">mott and Mackenzie settled comfortably into the warmth of the bar. In marked contrast to her husband, Jean scarcely drank alcohol at all, and she sipped carefully at a pineapple juice while the two men addressed themselves to the scotch. Nor did she try to talk shop in Brady's absence. Instead, she chatted pleasantly about Fort McMurray and its modest midwinter pleasures until her husband returned.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When he came back, Stella was with him, swinging along with her easy, loose-hipped walk. Dermott—not normally given to flights of fancy— was suddenly struck by the absurd disparity between the two figures. Jesus, he thought to himself: a hippo and a gazelle. What a pair!</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Scarcely had Brady subsided into an armchair, with an outsize glass of daiquiri in his pudgy hand, than he made a slight sign to Dermott and Mackenzie, who muttered something and slipped off.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady seemed in buoyant form, and began to regale his family with an edited account of his movements around the far north. After a while Jean said doubtfully, &quot;It doesn't seem to me you've <I>accomplished </I>very much.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady was unruffled. &quot;Ninety per cent of our business is cerebral, my dear. When we move into action, what happens is merely the almost mechanical and inevitable culmination of all the invisible hard work that's gone on before.&quot; He tapped his head. &quot;The wise general doesn't fling his troops into battle without reconnoitering beforehand. We've been reconnoiter ing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jean smiled. &quot;Let us know when you've identified the enemy.&quot; Suddenly she became serious. &quot;It's a nasty business, isn't it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Murder always is, my dear.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't like it, Jim. I don't like you being in it.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Surely this is for the law. You've never come across murder before in your business.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So I run away?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She looked at his ample frame and laughed, &quot;That's one thing you're not built for.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Run?&quot; Stella said, mock-scornfully. &quot;Dad couldn't jog from here to the John!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Please!&quot; Brady beamed. &quot;I trust no such haste will be necessary.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where did Donald go?&quot; Jean asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Upstairs, doing a little job for me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie was at that moment moving slowly around Brady's apartment with a calibrated metal box in one hand, a portable antenna in the other and a pair of earphones on his head. He moved purposefully, a man who knew what he was about. He soon found what he was looking for.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When he came back to the bar he headed straight for Brady's family encampment.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two,&quot; he reported.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two what, Uncle Donald?&quot; Stella asked sweetly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie appealed to his boss. &quot;When are you going to start training this incorrigibly nosy daughter of yours?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've stopped. Failed. Mother's job, anyway.&quot; He jerked his head upward. &quot;Got them all, did you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Guess so.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott also reappeared to report.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, George,&quot; Brady greeted him. &quot;How did it go?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Reynolds' seems very co-operative. Unfortunately, all records are stored at the head office in Edmonton. He says by the time they've been dug out and flown up here, it may be late this evening or even tomorrow morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What records?&quot; Stella asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">118</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Affairs of state,&quot; Brady told her. &quot;Well, can't be helped. Anything else?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Naturally enough he's got no fingerprinting equipment.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">•   &quot;Fix it after lunch.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He says he'll fix it himself—the police chief's a pal of his, apparently. Thinks the chief might be a bit stuffy about the delay in reporting the crime.&quot; He grinned across at Stella. &quot;And don't ask 'what crime?'&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, sir, Mr. Dermott, sir!&quot; She wrinkled her upper lip in a fetching manner. &quot;I <I>never </I>ask questions if I'm just permitted to fetch and carry, mend and clean.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady went on, &quot;Reynolds can always claim that at first he thought it was an industrial accident.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I understand the chief of police has twenty-twenty vision and intelligence to match.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well—Reynolds'll have to handle it as best he can. What about Prudhoe Bay?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;An hour's hold. They'll page me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Brady shifted his attention to Stella. &quot;We met an enchanting girl this morning— didn't we, George? Knock spots off you, any day. Wouldn't she, gentlemen?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Unquestionably,&quot; said Mackenzie.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stella looked at Dermott. &quot;Foul, aren't they?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dead heat,&quot; said Dermott, &quot;but she's very nice.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The manager's secretary,&quot; Brady said. &quot;Cor-inne Delorme. I thought maybe you'd like to meet her. She said she'd like to meet you. She must know all the nightclubs, discos and other iniquitous dens in Fort McMurray.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stella said, &quot;News for you, Dad. You've got to</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">be talking about another town. I don't know what this place is like in summer, but whatever it is, it's a dead city in mid-winter. You might have warned us that this is an <I>Arctic </I>town.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Lovely choice of phrase. Wonderful sense of geography. That's education for you,&quot; Brady said to no one in particular. &quot;Maybe you should have stayed in Houston.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stella looked at her mother. &quot;Did you hear what I just heard, Mom?&quot; she asked with a scornful shake of the head at her father, which brought the pale blond hair swinging around her face.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jean smiled. &quot;I heard. Sooner or later, my dear, you have to face up to the fact that your father is no more and no less than a fearful old hypocrite.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But he dragged us up here, kicking and screaming against our wills, and now...&quot; Remarkably, words failed her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As much as it was possible for so rubicund a face to register an expression, Brady's was registering unhappiness. &quot;Well, now you've found out you don't like it, maybe you'd rather get back down to Houston.&quot; A note of wistfulness crept into his voice. &quot;It'll be nearly seventy .degrees back there now.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Silence descended. Brady looked at Dermott and Dermott looked at him. Jean Brady looked at both of them. &quot;Something goes on that I don't understand,&quot; she said. Brady dropped his eyes, so she switched her attention to Dermott. &quot;George?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, ma'am?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;George!&quot; He looked at her. &quot;And don't call me</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">'ma'am.'&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, Jean.&quot; He sighed and spoke with some feeling. &quot;The boss of Brady Enterprises is not only a fearful old hypocrite, he's a fearful old coward as</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MaeLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">well. What he wants, in the good old-fashioned western phrase, is that you should get out of town.&quot; . &quot;Why? What on earth have we done?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott looked hopefully at Mackenzie, who said, &quot;You've done nothing. He has—or is about to.&quot; Mackenzie shook his head at Dermott. &quot;This is difficult,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott explained, &quot;We've decided on a course of action to flush the ungodly into the open, make them show their hand. Don and I have this unpleasant feeling that their reaction may be directed against Brady Enterprises in general and its boss in particular. The reaction may be violent—these people don't play by any rules but their own. We don't think they'd go for Jim himself. It's well known that he can't be intimidated. But what's equally well known is what he thinks of his own family. If they got you or Stella, or both of you, they might figure they could force him to pull out.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jean reached out to take Stella's hand. &quot;But this must be nonsense,&quot; she said. &quot;Drama. Things like that don't happen anymore. Don, I appeal to you...&quot; She looked anxiously at her daughter, gave her hand a little shake and released it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie was dogged. &quot;Don't appeal to me, Jean. When they snip off your finger with the wedding ring on it, will you still be saying things like that don't happen anymore?&quot; She looked hurt. &quot;Sorry if I sound brutal, but things like that have never stopped happening. It may not come to anything so bad. I'm looking on the blackest possible side. But that's the only sensible way to look. We've got to find a safe place for you and Stella. How can Jim operate at his best if you're on his mind?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's right,&quot; muttered Brady. &quot;Go pack your bags, please.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">During Mackenzie's speech Stella had sat with her hands clasped together on her lap, like a schoolgirl, listening gravely. Now she said, &quot;I can't do that, Dad.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why not?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who's going to make your daiquiris for you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Her mother cut in sharply. &quot;There's a little more to this than the damned daiquiris. If we left, who's going to be number one target?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dad,&quot; said Stella flatly. She glowered at Dermott. &quot;You know that, George,&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I do,&quot; he answered mildly. &quot;But Donald and I are pretty good at looking after people.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That would be just fine, wouldn't it?&quot; She threw herself back in her chair, hazel eyes blazing. &quot;All three of you shot or blown up or something.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Getting upset isn't going to help,&quot; said Jean soothingly. &quot;Logic will, though.&quot; She transferred her attention to Brady. &quot;If we went, you'd still be worried stiff about us, and we'd be worried stiff about you. So where would that get us?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said nothing, and she went on, &quot;But there's only one point that really matters. Not only will I not run away from my husband, I'll be damned if Jean Brady will run, period.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stella said, &quot;And <I>I'll </I>be damned if Stella Brady runs either. Who's gonna maintain communications, for one thing? You know how long I spent on the phone today—to England and all that? <I>Four hours.&quot; </I>She stood up decisively. &quot;Another drink, Dad?&quot; She cocked an ear at him ostentatiously. &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">'&quot;Monstrous regiment of women,' was what I said.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah!&quot; she smiled, collected the empty glasses and headed for the bar. Brady glared at Dermott and</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie. &quot;Hell of a lot of good you two are. Why didn't you back me up?&quot; He sighed heavily and changed his tack. &quot;Why don't we all get something to eat? Lunch, and after that I'll catch up on some sleep. What are you girls proposing to do this afternoon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stella came back with full glasses. &quot;We're going for a sleigh ride. Won't that be nice!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good God! You mean <I>outside?&quot; </I>Brady gloomily surveyed the few flakes drifting past the window. &quot;Very nice for some, I'm sure, but not for the sane.&quot; He struggled to his feet. &quot;The dining room in two minutes, then. George, if you will.&quot; He took Dermott aside.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">With a giaiit Caribou T-bone steak, a quarter of blueberry pie and some excellent California burgundy inside him, Brady watched his befurred wife and daughter go out through the main entrance and sighed with satisfaction at the feeling of physical well-being that enveloped him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, gentlemen, I really believe I might manage a brief snooze after all. Yourselves too?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Off and on. Donald and I thought we'd chivvy up Prudhoe Bay and Sanmobil and get those names and records through as soon as possible.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, thank you, gentlemen. Very considerate. Do not wake me up unless Armageddon is nigh. Aha! Here, not unexpectedly, return the ladies.&quot; He waited until his wife had reached the table. &quot;Something up, then?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Something is up.&quot; Jean did not sound pleased.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There are two men on the driving bench of that sleigh. Why two?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My dear, I'm not the arbiter of local customs. Are you afraid they're homosexual?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She lowered her voice. &quot;They're both carrying guns. You can't see them, but you can, if you know what I mean.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are entitled to bear arms at all times. Says so in their constitution.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jean stared at him, snorted with resignation, turned and left. Jim Brady beamed in satisfaction. Mackenzie said airily, &quot;They tell me there are some very handsome young constables in the RCMP.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Apart from chatting with Ferguson, Brady's pilot, Dermott spent the afternoon alone in the lounge, consuming one cup of coffee after the other. About mid-afternoon Jean and Stella returned, rosy-cheeked and in high spirits. Stella, it appeared, had learned from their escorts of a place where the younger people congregated of an evening, and had called Corinne Delorme at work to invite her out. Whether they intended to invite their erstwhile escorts along, Stella did not say nor did Dermott inquire. Brady would have the place comprehensively checked out before he would let them near it. Shortly afterward Dermott received a call from Alaska. It was Bronowski in Prudhoe Bay. John Finlayson, he said, was out at Pump Station Four but was expected back soon. He, Bronowski, would immediately set about obtaining what Dermott wanted and would arrange for the services of a fingerprint expert from Anchorage.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At five o'clock Reynolds came through to say that the fingerprinting was well in hand. The records Dermott required were even then being delivered to Edmonton airport and would be delivered straight from McMurray airport to the hotel. At six-thirty Mackenzie appeared, looking refreshed but at the same time reproachful.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You should have called me. I'd meant to come down a couple of hours ago.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll sleep tonight,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;That's four hours you owe me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Three and a half. I put a call through to Houston, explained what we had in mind, told them to alert Washington and New York, and emphasized the urgency.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I trust your unofficial listener got it all down.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He could hardly fail to,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;There was a bug installed inside the base plate of the telephone.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, that should be the final stirring-up of the hornets' nest. Let's hope the wrong people don't get stung. How's Jim?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Peered around his door on the way down. Looked like he'd died in his sleep.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Reynolds? Not more bad news, I hope.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Reynolds said, &quot;What was that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Talking to Donald Mackenzie. He's listening in. So they know that we know it's an inside job. They must be pretty sure of themselves. Who's got access to the code books?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you think Armageddon is nigh enough to justify waking up the boss?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not yet. Nothing he, we or anybody can do. Infuriating. Let's try Anchorage.

They're not sure.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The telephone rang. Dermott picked it up. &quot;Anchorage? No it can't be.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;Well, they seem pretty confident.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It all helps,&quot; Mackenzie said gloomily.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's not all that bad. The photostat is promised for tomorrow. Might just match up with some of the prints we hope to collect. The Alaskan ones, I mean.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stella came into the lounge, all set for dancing in black sequinned silk and colored tights, and carrying her coat. Dermott said, &quot;And where do you think you're going?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stella said, &quot;I'm going out with Corinne. First a snack and then the bright lights and the light fantastic.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, I suppose that does make a difference. Ah, here comes Corinne.&quot; He beckoned her across, made the introductions and watched as they moved off. &quot;Well, I suppose we worry too much.&quot; He glanced at the doorway. &quot;When I look at that lot coming in, I hardly think we need worry at all.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That lot&quot; were a pretty formidable looking pair—big men in their late twenties or early thirties who looked eminently capable of taking care not only of themselves but of anyone who might be along with them. Dermott and Mackenzie rose and crossed to meet them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;I could be wrong, but you wouldn't be two policemen disguise^ as civilians?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There we go,&quot; said the fair-haired man. &quot;Can't be very good at undercover work if it's as obvious as that. I'm John Carmody. This is Bill Jones. You must be Mr. Dermott and Mr. Mackenzie. Miss Brady described you to us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie asked, &quot;You gentlemen on overtime tonight?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody grinned. &quot;Tonight? Two gallant volunteers. Labor of love. Doesn't look like being any great hardship.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think we might be able to take care of that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure you can. Most kind of you gentlemen. Very much appreciated, I can tell you. I know Mr. Brady would like to thank you himself, but as he's in the land of dreams, I'll do it on his behalf. The girls are through there. I hope you have a pleasant evening.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott and Mackenzie returned to their table, where they talked in desultory fashion. Then the phone rang again. This time it was Alaska: Prudhoe Bay.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Tim Houston here. Bad news, I'm afraid. Sam Bronowski is in the hospital. I found him lying unconscious on the floor of Finlayson's office. Appears to have been struck over the head with a heavy object. He was hit over the temple where the skull is thinnest. Doctor says there may be a fracture—he's just finishing some X rays. He's certainly concussed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When did this happen?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Half hour ago. No more. But that's not all. John Finlayson is missing. He vanished soon after coming back from Pump Station Pour. Searched everywhere. No trace of him. Not in any of the buildings. If he's outside on a night like this, well&quot;—there was a grim pause—&quot;he won't be around for long. We've got a high wind and heavy drifting, and the temperature's between thirty and forty below. Every man in the place is out looking for him. Maybe he was attacked by the same person who attacked Bronowski. Maybe he wandered out dazed. Maybe he was forcibly removed—although I don't see how that could be possible with so many people around. Are you coming up?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How did you know?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They made similar demands. We've got one here. I'll talk to Mr. Brady. If you don't hear, you'll know we're on our way.&quot; He replaced the receiver and said to Mackenzie, &quot;Armageddon? Enough to wake Jim?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ferguson, the pilot, was unhappy and with good reason. Throughout the flight he was in more or less continuous touch with the operations center in Pru-dhoe Bay, and knew that the weather ahead was dangerous. The wind was gusting at 40 miles per hour. Flying snow had cut ground visibility to a few feet, and the thickness of the drifting surface snow storm was estimated at sixty feet or even more—less than ideal circumstances for landing a fast jet in darkness.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ferguson had every modern navigational and landing aid, but although he could make a hands-off touchdown if he had to, he preferred to see <I>terra firma </I>before he put his wheels down on it. One factor in Ferguson's favor was that he was a profound pessimist. His three passengers well knew that he was not given to endangering his own life, let alone those of other people on board, and would have turned back had the risks been too great.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady, who had been wakened from a deep sleep and was in a sour mood, spoke scarcely a word on the way north. Mackenzie and Dermott, aware</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The landing, with much advancing and retarding of the throttles, was a heavy, bouncing one, but nonetheless safely accomplished. Visibility was down to twenty feet, and Ferguson crept cautiously forward until he picked up the lights of a vehicle. When the cabin door was opened, freezing snow whirled in, and Brady lost no time in making his customary elephantine dash for the shelter of the waiting minibus. At the wheel was Tim Houston, lieutenant to the invalided Bronowski.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Evening, Mr. Brady.&quot; Houston wore no welcoming smile. &quot;Filthy night. I won't ask if you had a good flight because I'm sure you didn't. Afraid you haven't had too much sleep since you camexto the northwest.&quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                                                    </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">x^</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm exhausted.&quot; Brady didn't mention that he'd had six hours' sleep before leaving Fort Mc-Murray. &quot;What's the word about John Finlayson?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None. We've examined every building, every pump house, every last shack within a mile of the Operations Center. We thought there was a remote chance that he'd gone across to the ARCO Center, but they searched and found nothing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What's your feeling?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's dead. He must be.&quot; Houston shook his head. &quot;If he isn't—or wasn't—under cover, he couldn't have lasted a quarter of the time he's been missing. What makes that even more certain is that he didn't take his outdoor furs with him. Without furs? Ten minutes, if that.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The FBI or police come up with anything?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. He could be in a gully or by the roadside— our roads are built five feet high on gravel—and he could be lying at the bottom of a ditch with not even a mound to show where he is.&quot; Houston gave a shrug.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What a way to die,&quot; Mackenzie said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm accepting the fact that he is gone,&quot; Houston said, &quot;and though it sounds callous, maybe, it's not such a bad way to go. Perhaps the easiest <I>way </I>to go. No suffering. You just go to sleep and never wake up again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;You make it sound almost pleasant. How's Bronowski?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No fracture. Heavy contusions. Dr. Blake reckons the concussion is only slight. He was stirring and seeming to make an effort to surface when I left the camp.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No further progress in that direction?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing. Very much doubt whether there will be either. Sam was the only person who could have told us anything or identified his assailant. It's a thousand to one that he was attacked from behind and never caught a glimpse of his attacker. If he had, the attacker would probably have silenced him for keeps. After you've killed two people, what's a third?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The same people, you reckon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Houston stared. &quot;It's too much of a coincidence to be different people, Mr. Brady.&quot; &quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I suppose. This Telex from Edmonton?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Houston scratched his head. &quot;Told us to close down the line for a week. Says they're going to check in forty-eight hours.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And in your own company code, you said?&quot; Dermott asked him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. &quot;They didn't give a damn about letting us see it was an inside job. Damned arrogance. And the Telex was addressed to Mr. Black. Only someone working on the pipeline would know that he was up here. He spends nearly all his time in Anchorage.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;How's Black taking this?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Difficult to say. Bit of a cold fish—not much given to showing his feelings. I know how I'd feel in his shoes. He's the general manager, Alaska, and the buck stops with him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Houston was doing Black a degree less than justice. When they arrived/at his office in the Operations Center, he had a distinctly unhappy and <I>distrait </I>air about him. He said, &quot;Good of you to come, Mr. Brady. Must have been a highly unpleasant trip—and in the middle of a winter's night.&quot; He turned to a tall tanned man with iron-gray hair. This is Mr. Morrison. FBI.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Morrison shook hands with all three. &quot;Know of you, of course, Mr. Brady. I'll bet you don't get too much of this sort of thing out in the Gulf States.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Never. Don't get any of this damnable snow and cold either. Mr. Houston here tells me that you're all up against a blank wall. Finlayson'&amp;just vanished.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Morrison said, &quot;We were hoping that a fresh mind might be of use.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;From top to bottom. Hundreds of prints, and not one seems to be of any use. No prints there that shouldn't have been there.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You mean that the owners of those prints all had regular and legitimate access to the office?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Morrison nodded. &quot;Just that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady scowled. &quot;And since we're convinced that this character is someone working on the pipeline, any one of those fingerprints might be his.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie asked the FBI man, &quot;Any sign of the weapon used on Bronowski?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing. Dr. Blake believes the blow was administered by the butt of a gun.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott asked, &quot;Where's the doctor?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In the sick bay, with Bronowski, who's just recovered consciousness. He's still dazed and incoherent, but it seems he'll be okay.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can we see the two of them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't know,&quot; Black said. &quot;The doctor, certainly. I don't know whether he'll allow you to talk to Bronowski.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He can't be all that bad if he's conscious,&quot; said Dermott. 'It's a matter of urgency. He's the only person who <I>might </I>be able to give us a clue about what happened to Finlayson.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When they arrived in the sick bay, Bronowski was speaking coherently enough to Dr. Blake. He was very pale, the right hand side of his head had been shaved, and a huge bandage, stretching from the top of his skull to the lobe of the ear, covered the right temple. Dermott looked at the doctor, a tall, swarthy man with an almost cadaverous face and a hooked nose.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Coming on. The wound's not too bad. He's just been soundly stunned, which is apt to addle anyone's brains a bit. Headache for a couple of days.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A couple of brief questions for Bronowski.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, brief.&quot; Dr. Blake nodded at Dermott's companions,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott asked, &quot;Did you see the guy who knocked you down?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;See him?&quot; Bronowski exclaimed. &quot;Didn't even hear him. First thing I knew of anything was when I woke up in this bed here.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Did you know Finlayson was missing?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. How long's he been gone?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Some hours. Must have gone missing before you were clobbered. Did you see him at all? Speak to him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I did. I was working on those reports you asked me to get for you. He asked about the conversation I had with you, then left.&quot; Bronowski thought about it. &quot;That was the last I saw of him.&quot; He looked at Black. &quot;Those papers I was working on. Are they still on the table?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I saw them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can you have them put back in the safe, please? They're confidential.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Til do that,&quot; Black said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott asked,.&quot;May I see you a minute, doctor?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're seeing me now.&quot; The doctor looked quizzically at Dermott down his long nose.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott smiled heavily. &quot;Do you want me to discuss my chilblains and gout in public?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In the consulting room Dr. Blake said, &quot;You look in pretty good shape to me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Advancing years is all. Have you been up to Pump Station Four?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                      </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">137</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, so it's that business! What stopped you discussing it out there?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because I'm naturally cagey, distrustful and suspicious.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I went up with Finlayson.&quot; Blake made a grimace at the memory. &quot;Place was a ghastly mess. So were the two murdered men.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They were all that,&quot; Dermott agreed. &quot;Did you carry out an autopsy on them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was a pause. &quot;Have you the right to be asking me these questions?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott nodded. &quot;I think so, Doctor. We're all interested injustice. I'm trying to find out who killed those two men. May be three, by now, if Finlayson stays missing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Very well,&quot; Blake said. &quot;I carried out an autopsy. It was fairly perfunctory, I admit. When men have been shot through the forehead, it's pointless to try to establish the possibility that they died of heart failure instead. Although, mind you, from the mangled state of their bodies, it's clear that the blast effect of the explosion would in itself have been enough to kill them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The bullets were still lodged in the head?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They were and are. A low-velocity pistol. I know they'll have to be recovered, but that's a job for the police surgeon, not for me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Did you search them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Blake lifted a saturnine eyebrow. &quot;My dear fellow, I'm a doctor, not a detective. Why should I search them? I did see that one had some papers in an inside coat pocket, but I didn't examine them. That was all.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No gun? No holster?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can testify to that. I had to remove coat and shirt. Nothing of that nature.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">138</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One last question,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Did you notice the index finger on the same man's right hand?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fractured just below the knuckle bone? Odd sort of break in a way, but it could have resulted from a variety of causes. Don't forget the blast flung both of them heavily against some machinery.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you for your patience.&quot; Dermott made for the door, then turned. &quot;The dead men are still at Pump Station Four?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. We brought them back here. I understand their families want them buried in Anchorage, and that they'll be flown down there tomorrow.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott looked around Finlayson's office and said to Black, &quot;Anything been altered since Bron-owski was discovered here?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You'd have to ask Mr. Morrison. At the time, I was across seeing my opposite number in ARCO and didn't get here for twenty minutes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The FBI man said, &quot;Some things have been touched, naturally. My men had to when they were carrying out their fingerprinting.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie nodded to the buff folders on Finlayson's desk. &quot;Are those the reports on the security men? The ones that Bronowski said he was studying when he was clobbered?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black looked at Houston, and the security man said, &quot;Yes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There were fingerprints, too.&quot; Mackenzie raised an eyebrow.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Those will be in the safe,&quot; Houston said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We'd like to see those and the records,&quot; Der-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">mott said. &quot;In fact, we'd like to see everything in that safe.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black intervened. &quot;But that's' where all our company confidential information is kept.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's precisely why we'd like to examine it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black compressed his lips. &quot;That's a very large order, Mr. Dermott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If our hands are to be tied, we might as well go back to Houston. Or have you something to hide?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I consider that remark offensive.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't.&quot; Brady had spoken from the depths of the only armchair in the room. &quot;If you have something to hide, we'd like to know what it is. If you haven't, open up your safe. You may be the senior man in Alaska, but the people in London are the ones that matter, and they've promised me we would be afforded every co-operation. You are showing distinct signs of lack of co-operation. I must say that gives me food for thought.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black's lips were very pale now. &quot;That could be construed as a veiled threat, Mr. Brady.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Construe it any damned way you like. We've been through this up here once before. And John Finlayson has gone on a walk-about or somewhere even less attractive. Co-operate or we leave—and leave you with the task of explaining to London the reason for your secretiveness.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am not being secretive. In the best interests of the company—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The best interest of your company is to keep that oil flowing and head off these killers. If you don't let us examine that safe, we can only conclude that for some reason you choose to obstruct the best interest of your company.&quot; Brady poured himself a daiquiri as if to indicate that his part of the discussion was over.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">140</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black surrendered. &quot;Very well.&quot; The lips had now thinned almost to nothing. &quot;Under protest and under, I may say, duress, I agree to what I regard as an outrageous request. The keys are in Mr. Fin-layson's desk. I will bid you good night.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One moment.&quot; Dermott didn't sound any more friendly than Black. &quot;Do you have records of <I>all </I>your employees on the pipeline?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was clear that Black was considering some further opposition, and then decided against it. &quot;We do. But very concise. Couldn't call them reports. Mainly, just brief notes of previous jobs held.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where are they? Here?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. Only reports on security personnel are kept here, and that's because Bronowski regards this as his base. The rest are kept in Anchorage.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We'd like to see them. Perhaps you can arrange for them to be made available?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can arrange it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I understand from Dr. Blake that you have a flight to Anchorage tomorrow. Is it a big plane?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Too big,&quot; said Black the accountant. &quot;A 737. Only one available tomorrow., Why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One or more of us might want to hitch a lift,&quot; Dermott answered. &quot;We could, among other things, pick up those reports. Seats would be available?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black said, &quot;Yes. No more questions, I trust?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One. You received this threatening Telex message from Edmonton today telling you to close down the line or else. What do you propose to do?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Carry on production, of course.&quot; Black tried to smile sardonically, but 'the moment was wrong. &quot;Assuming, of course, that the criminals have been apprehended?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where's the Telex?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bronowski had it. It may be on his person. Or in his desk.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll find it,&quot; Dermott said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't think Bronowski would like you rummaging about his desk.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's not here, is he? Besides, he's a security man. He would understand.&quot; Dermott shook his head. &quot;I don't think you ever will.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; Black said. &quot;Good night.&quot; He turned on his heel and left. No one said &quot;good night&quot; to him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, well.&quot; Brady exclaimed. &quot;A friend for life in three minutes flat. Don't know how you do it, George. Pity he acts so suspiciously—otherwise he'd have made a splendid suspect.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Badly ruffled feathers,&quot; Morrison said. &quot;To put it in a restrained fashion, ruffling other people's feathers is his specialty. A martinet of the first order, they say, but an extraordinarily able man.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Not, I gather, universally popular. Does he have friends?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Professional business contacts, that's all. Socially, nothing. If he has any friends, he hides them well.&quot; He tried to conceal a yawn. &quot;My normal bedtime lies well behind me. In the FBI, we try to get to bed by ten P.M. Can I be of any assistance before I go?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two things,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;The maintenance crew at Pump Station Four. Fellow called Poulson in charge. Could you have their backgrounds investigated as rigorously as possible?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have a reason for asking?&quot; The FBI man sounded hopeful.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing really. Just that they happened to be there when the sabotage occurred. I'm clutching at straws. We have damn little else to clutch at.&quot; Dermott smiled wryly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">142</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think we can do that,&quot; Morrison said. &quot;And the other?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dr. Blake tells me that the two dead engineers were brought back here today. Do you know where they were put?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Morrison knew and told them, said his good nights and left.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;I think I shall go and rest lightly in my room. Notify me if the heavens fall in. But not after the first half hour or so. I take it you two are about to indulge your morbid curiosity in viewing the departed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott and Mackenzie looked down at the two murdered engineers. They had been covered in white sheets. No attempt had been made to clean them up since they last saw them at Pump Station Four. Perhaps it had been impossible. Perhaps no one had had a strong enough stomach for the task. Mackenzie said, &quot;I hope they're going to be sewn up in canvas or something before being taken to Anchorage tomorrow, or their relatives are going to have the screaming heebie-jeebies. Whatever you're looking for, George, look for it quick. I'm not enjoying myself.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Nor was Dermott. Not only was the sight revolting, but the smell was nauseating. He lifted the hand of the man he'd briefly examined before and said, &quot;How would you say that forefinger got that way?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie bent, wrinkled his nose and said, &quot;It sounds crazy, but it could have been broken by a pair of pliers. The trouble is that charring's obliterated any marks that might have been made on the skin.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                      </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">143</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott went to a wash basin, soaked his handkerchief and cleaned up the charred area as best he could. The black carbon came off surprisingly easily. It didn't leave the skin clean—the pitting was too deep for that—but clean enough to permit a closer examination.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No pliers,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;To break the bone, pliers would have had to close right into the flesh and would have been bound to leave saw-tooth marks. No saw-tooth marks, so no pliers. But I agree with you. I'm sure that bone was deliberately broken.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott rubbed some carbon off the charred clothing and smeared it on the cleaned area so that it did not look as if it had been wiped. He opened the jacket and slid his hand into the inside pocket: it came out empty. Mackenzie said, &quot;The papers and cards have taken wing and flown. With assistance, of course.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Indeed. Could have been Poulson or one of his pals. Could have been Bronowski when he was out there yesterday. Could have been the kindly healer himself.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Blake? He does look like a first cousin of Dra-cula,&quot; Mackenzie said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott raised the damp handkerchief again and started to clear the area around the bullet in the forehead. He peered closely at the wound and said to Mackenzie, &quot;Can you see what I imagine I see?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie stooped low and peered closely. Still stooped, he said softly, &quot;With the hawk eyes of my youth gone forever, I could do with a powerful magnifying glass.&quot; He straightened. &quot;What I imagine I see is the brown scorch marks of burned powder.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As before, Dermott smeared some carbon back on the cleaned area. &quot;Funny—my imagination runs</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">144</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">the same way. This guy was shot at point blank range. The scenario reads that it was a very close thing indeed. The killer had a gun on this engineer and was probably searching him. What he didn't know was that the engineer not only had a gun of his own, but had it out. However it was, he must have seen it just in time and shot to kill—there could have been no time to indulge in any fancier gunwork. The engineer's gun hand must have gone into muscular spasm—irreversible contraction; not unknown at the time of violent death. To free the gun, the killer had to wrench it so violently that he snapped the trigger finger. Don't you think that fits in with the peculiar angle at which the finger was broken?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think you have it. It fits, anyway.&quot; Mackenzie frowned. &quot;There's only one thing I see wrong with your scenario. Why should the killer take the gun in the first place? He had a gun of his own.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure he had, but he couldn't use it anymore,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;More accurately, he couldn't afford to keep it anymore. Having seen no exit holes at the back of the head he knew he had left two bullets in the region of two occiputs, and that the police could match up the bullets with the gun he was carrying. Which meant he would have to get rid of it. Which meant that he would be gunless, at least temporarily. So he took the engineer's gun. My guess is that he will have got rid of both guns by this time, and he's almost certainly got another weapon by now. In these United States—and don't forget Alaska is the United States—getting hold of a hand gun is extremely simple.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said slowly, &quot;It all fits. We may well be up against a professional killer.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">\  &quot;We may well be up against a psychopath.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ancestry. Some ill-mannered lout has just walked all over my grave. Let's take counsel with the boss. Counsel and something else. If I know our worthy employer, he'll already have had half the .contents of the jet's bar brought to his room.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And you want his ideas?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I want some of those contents.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie had exaggerated somewhat. Ferguson hadn't brought across more than a tenth of the plane's stock, but even that represented a goodly amount. Mackenzie had already had his first scotch and was on his second. He looked at Brady, propped up in bed in a pair of shocking heliotrope pajamas, which served only to accentuate his massive girth, and said, &quot;Well, what do you make of George's theory?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I believe in the facts and I also believe in the theory, for the adequate reason that I see no alternative to it.&quot; Brady contemplated his fingernails. &quot;I also believe we're up against a trained, ruthless and intelligent killer. I don't doubt that he might be a psychopath on the loose. In fact, there may be <I>two </I>psychopaths—an even more unpleasant prospect. The trouble is, George, I don't see how this advances us much. We don't know when this nut will hit again. What can we do to prevent it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We can scare him,&quot; Dermott answered, &quot;that's what we can do. I'll bet he's already worried by the fact that we're raking in fingerprints and records all over the shop. Let's try to worry him a little more. I'll go down to Anchorage tomorrow while you and Mackenzie stay here and do some work.&quot; Dermott</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I could be deeply wounded,&quot; Brady said, &quot;but slings and arrows from an ungrateful staff are nothing new to me. What, precisely, do you have in mind?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Drastically narrowing the range of suspects is what I have in mind. All very simple, really. This is a close-knit community here in Prudhoe Bay. They more or less live out of each other's pockets. Everyone's movements must be known to at least a handful of other people, probably a great deal more. Check on everybody and find out who has a definite alibi for being here on the morning the engineers were being killed out in the mountains. If two or more people, say, can honestly tell you that X was here at the time of the crime, you can strike X off the suspects list. At the end of the day we'll knov; how many suspects we have. Not even a handful, I bet. I wouldn't be surprised if there were none at all. Remember that Pump Station Four is a hundred and forty miles away, and the only feasible way of getting there is by helicopter. One would have to have the time and opportunity and the ability to fly a helicopter to get there, and there would be no hope of taking a chopper without someone noticing. I think you'll find it all very straightforward.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Less straightforward is the next inquiry—who was in Anchorage on the day that the original phone message was sent from there to Sanmobil? There must have been quite a few. Don't forget they go on holiday every three or four weeks and, almost without exception, they go to Fairbanks or Anchorage. It will be more difficult to establish alibis. You won't find many people who have witnesses as to their whereabouts at 6 A.M. of a black winter morning in Alaska.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In this case, though, we're more concerned about those who are not in the clear than those who are. I'll bring back a photostat of the prints they've taken. We should be able to get the doubtfuls' fingerprints without too much trouble and, with luck, match one set up with the phone booth's set. I don't know how this sounds to you, but it seems quite straightforward to me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And to me,&quot; said Brady. &quot;I think Don and I can manage that little chore without too much difficulty. Don't forget, though, that there's a fairly large community of people down at Valdez.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As you're my boss,&quot; Dermott said, &quot;I'll refrain from giving you a withering stare. Who in Valdez is going to fly a round trip of thirteen hundred miles during a winter night, stopping occasionally for fuel and so giving his identity away? And who's going to fly or helicopter the sixteen hundred miles round trip to clobber Bronowski and very possibly do away with Finlayson, especially as he would be immediately recognized as a stranger the moment he set foot in this area?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;He has a point, you must admit. In fact, two points.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott went on, &quot;And don't tell me they could have come from one of the pumping stations. They don't have helicopters.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot; &quot;I didn't say anything of the sort.&quot; Brady sounded aggrieved. &quot;All right, we'll go along with the assumption that it's Prudhoe Bay or nothing. But what if we turn up zero?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then it will be your turn to come up with the next bright idea.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hard day,&quot; Brady said. &quot;You for bed?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. I had intended to look at those records and prints tonight, but the prints aren't going to be</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">of any use to me until I return from Anchorage. Reports can wait, too. I'll just hunt up that Edmonton Telex and take it down to the Anchorage police and see if they can help me.&quot; He stood up. &quot;By the way, has it occurred to you that you yourself may be in danger tonight?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Me!&quot; It was as if Dermott had suggested some unthinkable form of <I>lese-majeste. </I>Then a look of vague apprehension crept into Brady's face.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It may not be just your family who are at risk,&quot; Dermott persisted. &quot;Why should these people bother about kidnapping when they could achieve their ends by putting a bullet in your back—which is not, if I may say so without offense, a very easy target to miss? How are you to know there isn't a homicidal maniac in the room next door to you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good God!&quot; Brady drank deeply from his daiquiri. Then he sat back and smiled. &quot;At last, action! Donald, get the Smith and Wesson from my case.&quot; He took the gun, thrust it deep under his pillow and said, almost hopefully, &quot;Don't you think you two are at risk also?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure,&quot; Mackenzie said, &quot;but not nearly as much as you. No Jim Brady, no Brady Enterprises. You're the legend. Without either of us, you could still function quite efficiently. This homicidal maniac doesn't strike me as the type who would go for a couple of lieutenants while the captain is around.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good night, then,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Don't forget to lock your door as Boon as we're gone.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't worry. You're armed, right?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course. But we don't think we'll be needing any weapons.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Dermott woke up it was with such a heavy-headed feeling of exhaustion that he could have sworn he hadn't been to sleep at all. In fact, less than an hour had elapsed since he'd switched out the light, closed his eyes and dropped off. He did not wake up of his own volition. The overhead light was on and Morrison, looking as distraught as a senior FBI agent is ever likely to look, was shaking him by the shoulder. Dermott eyed him blearily.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sorry about this,&quot; Morrison began, &quot;but I thought you'd like to come along. In fact, I want you to.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott peered at his watch and winced. &quot;For God's sake, where?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We've found him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sleep, and all desire for it, dropped from Dermott like a cloak. &quot;Finlayson?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dead?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We don't know. You'll need warm clothing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Morrison left, Dermott rose and dressed for the cruel temperatures outside. As he pulled on a quilted anorak his mind went back to his first meeting with Finlayson. He thought of the neatly parted white hair, the grizzled Yukon beard, the hobo clothes. Had he been too hard on the man? No good worrying now. He pocketed a flashlight and moved into the passageway. Tim Houston was standing there. Dermott said, &quot;So you know too?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I found him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How come?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Instinct* I guess.&quot; The bitterness in Houston's voice was unmistakable. &quot;One of those finely honed instincts that comes into operation about ten hours too late.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Meaning that Finlayson could have been saved if this instinct of yours had been operational ten hours ago?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Maybe—but almost certainly not. John was murdered.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Shot? Knifed? What?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing like that. I didn't examine him. I knew that Mr. Morrison and you wouldn't want me to touch him. I didn't have to examine him. He's outside, it's thirty below, and all he's wearing is a linen shirt and jeans. He's not even got shoes on. That makes it murder.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said nothing, so Houston continued. &quot;Apart from the fact that he'd never have crossed the outside doorstep voluntarily without his Arctic clothing, he'd never have been permitted to do so anyway. There are always people in the reception area, besides a person who mans the central telephone fulltime. By the same token, it would have been impossible for anyone to carry him out.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                      </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">151</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Lugging corpses is conspicuous. So?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He wouldn't even have had to be a corpse. I think he was silenced in his own bedroom and bundled straight out the window. The cold would have finished him off. Here come your friends. I'll go get some more flashlights.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Outside, the cold was breathtaking. The temperature, as Houston had said, stood at thirty below. The forty-mile-per-hour gale brought the combination of temperature and chill-factor down to minus seventy. Even double-wrapped as a polar bear, without an exposed inch of flesh, the fact remains that one still has to breathe—and breathing in those conditions, until numbness intervenes, is a form of exquisite and refined agony. In the initial stages it is impossible to tell whether one is inhaling glacial air or superheated steam: a searing sensation dominates all else. The only way to survive for any length of time is to breathe pure oxygen from a suitably insulated tank—but those are not readily available in the Arctic.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Houston led them around the right hand corner of the main building. After about ten yards he stopped, bent down and shone his flashlight between the supporting pilings. Other beams joined his.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A body lay face down, an insignificant heap already half-covered by the drifting snow. Dermott shouted, &quot;You have sharp eyes, Houston. A lot of people would have missed this. Let's get him inside.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't you want to examine him here, have a look around?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I do not. When this wind drops we'll come back and look for clues. In the meantime, I don't want to join Finlayson here.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I agree,&quot; Morrison said. His teeth chattered audibly, and he was shaking with the cold.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">152</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                   </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Recovering the body from under the building provided the four men with no problem. Even if Finlayson had weighed twice as much, they would have had him out in seconds flat, such was their determination to regain shelter and warmth as soon as possible. As it was, Finlayson was slightly built, and handling him was like handling a 150-pound log, so solidly frozen had he become. When they were clear of the pilings Dermott looked up at a brightly lit window above and yelled through the wind, &quot;Who's room is that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Houston shouted, &quot;His.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your theory fits, doesn't it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It does.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When they brought Finlayson into the reception area, there were perhaps half-a-dozen men sitting or standing around. For a moment nobody said anything. Then one man stepped forward and, with some diffidence, asked, &quot;Shall I bring Dr. Blake?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie shook his head, sadly. &quot;I'm sure he's an excellent doctor, but no medical school has yet got around to offering a course on raising a man from the dead. Thanks all the same.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Have we got an empty room where we can put him?&quot; Houston looked at him and Dermott shook his head in self-reproach. &quot;Okay. So my mind's gummed up with cold or lack of sleep or both. His own room, of course. Where can we find a rubber sheet?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">So they took Finlayson to his room and laid him on the rubber sheet on top of his bed. Dermott said, &quot;Is there an individual thermostat control in here?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure,&quot; said Houston. &quot;It's set on seventy-two.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Turn it up.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What for?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dr. Blake will want to do a postmortem. You</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">can't examine a person who's frozen solid. We're getting experienced at this sort of thing. Too experienced.&quot; Dermott turned to Mackenzie. &quot;Houston thinks Finlayson was silenced in this room. Killed, knocked out, we don't know. He also thinks that our friends got rid of him by the simple expedient of opening the window and dumping him onto the snow bank beneath.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie crossed to the window, opened it, shivered at the icy blast of air that swept into the room, leaned out and peered down. Seconds later he had the~window firmly closed again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Has to be that. We're directly above the spot where we found him. And it's in deep shadow down there.&quot; He looked at Houston. &quot;Is there much traffic along there at night?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None. Nor during the day. No call for it. Track leads nowhere.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So the killers left either by the front door or by this same window. They did the obvious thing-just stuffed him under the building, hoping the snow would have drifted over him before daylight came.&quot; Mackenzie sighed. &quot;He couldn't by any chance have felt sick, opened the window for some fresh air, fell and crawled under the building?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;You believe that's possible?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. John Finlayson wouldn't get a breath of fresh air that way. He got <I>a </I>dearth of fresh air. Murder.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, I think the boss should be told.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's sure going to be pleased, isn't he?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady was furious. His black scowl accorded ill with his heliotrope pajamas. He said, &quot;Progress on</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">all fronts. What do you two intend to do?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said pacifically, &quot;That's why we're here. We thought you might be able to give us a lead.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A lead? How the hell can I give you a lead? I've been asleep.&quot; He corrected himself. &quot;Well, for a few minutes, anyway. Sad about Finlayson. Fine man, by all accounts. What do you reckon, George?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One thing's for sure. The similarities between what happened here tonight and what occurred at Pump Station Four are too great to be a coincidence. As with the two engineers, so with Finlayson. They all saw or heard too much for their own health. They recognized a person or persons whom they knew well and who knew them, and those people were engaged in something that couldn't be explained away. So they had to be silenced in the most final way.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady thought for a moment, and asked, &quot;Is there a direct connection between Bronowski being clobbered and Finlayson being killed?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wouldn't bet on it,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Tie-up looks too obvious. You could argue that Bronowski escaped because he didn't catch his assailants red-handed in whatever they were doing, and that Finlayson died because he did. But that's too easy, too glib.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What does Houston think?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He doesn't appear to have any more idea about it than we do.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;'Appear?'&quot; Brady seized on the word. &quot;You mean he may know more than he's telling?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;At the moment he's not saying or telling anything.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But you don't trust him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. And while we're at it, I don't trust Bronowski.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hell, man, he's been savagely assaulted.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Assaulted. Not savagely. I don't trust Dr. Blake, either.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because he's unhelpful and unco-operative?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A good enough reason.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady became tactful. &quot;Well, you do tend to ride a bit roughshod over people's feelings.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To hell with their delicate sensibilities! We're dealing here with three cases of murder. Come to that, I don't trust Black either.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You don't trust Black? General manager, Alberta?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He can be the King of Siam for all I care,&quot; Dermott said forcefully. &quot;Some of the most successful businessmen in history also number in the ranks of the biggest swindlers ever. I'm not suggesting he is a swindler. All I say is that he's crafty, cagey, cold and unco-operative. In short, I don't trust any-one.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Look, friends, we're looking at this from the wrong angle,&quot; Brady suggested. &quot;We're on the inside trying to look out. Maybe we should be on the outside trying to look in. Think of it this way. Who <I>wants </I>to hit the pipeline here and at the tar sands of Athabasca? Do you see any significance in the fact that here they receive their instructions from Edmonton while in Alberta they come from Anchorage?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None.&quot; Dermott was positive. &quot;May be just coincidence, at best a crude attempt to confuse us. Surely they can't be so nai've as to try to convey the impression that Canada is trying to interfere with America's oil supplies and vice versa. Idea's ludicrous. In these times of an acute oil shortage, what have two friendly neighbors to gain by cutting each other's throats?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then who <I>has </I>to gain?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie spoke quietly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;OPEC,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie was just as positive as Dermott had been. &quot;If they could put a stranglehold on the two countries' supplies from the north, they stand to gain immensely in both profits and power. Both our governments have made it clear that they're prepared to go to any lengths to shake free once and for all from this crucifying dependence on OPEC oil. This wouldn't suit our foreign friends at all. They have us over a barrel—-an oil barrel, if you will—and they want to keep it that way.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why now,&quot; Jim Brady said, &quot;although I know as well as you do.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They have tremendous leverage at the moment, and the last thing they'd ever want to do is to abdicate this position of almost dictatorial power. Decisions are being made now in both countries. Should North America become anywhere near self-sufficient in oil, our blackmailing friends would lose their power base. They'd be forced to abandon their pretensions to playing an authoritative role in world affairs, and perhaps worst of all for them, their profits would be reduced to such a trickle that they'd have to forgo their grandiose schemes for industrial and technological expansion, for hauling their countries into the middle of the late twentieth century, without any of the intermediate struggle or learning and developmental process. When it comes to national survival, desperate men are prepared to go to desperate lengths.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady paced for some time, then said, &quot;Do you really think the OPEC countries would take concerted action against us?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hell, no. Half of them are barely on speaking</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">terms with the other half, and you can't imagine relatively moderate countries like Saudi Arabia participating in any such combined operation. But you know as well as I do that among the OPEC rulers there are some certifiable loonies who would stop at nothing to achieve their own ends. And you won't have forgotten that some of those countries play host to the most ruthless terrorist trainers in the business.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;What would you say to that, George?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a theory, and a perfectly tenable one. On the other hand, since coming here I haven't seen a single person who looks remotely like an Arabian or Middle Eastern terrorist.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So what would your guess be?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As a <I>wild </I>guess, I would suspect our troubles are caused by good old-fashioned capitalistic free enterprise. And if that's the case, the potential sources of our troubles are legion. I'm afraid we won't solve this by looking at it from the outside; we'll have to look out from the inside.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And the motive?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Blackmail, obviously.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Cash?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, the only other bargaining counter is hostages. Nobody's balding any hostages. So what's left? They're now in the process of softening us up by proving they can carry out their threats when and as they wish.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They won't be asking for pennies.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I shouldn't think so. To start with, the pipeline and Sanmobil have a combined investment of ten billion. For every day that delivery is held up they'll be losing millions more. Most important of all, our two countries are desperate for oil. Whoever those people are, they have us not over but in a barrel.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who'd pay it?&quot; Mackenzie said.</FONT><BR>
</P>

You've a big responsibility on your shoulders, Mr. Brady.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You, George, are a rock of strength and compassion in times of trouble and stress.&quot; Brady sounded plaintive. &quot;Well, if there are no constructive suggestions forthcoming, I suggest we all retire. There is thinking to be done and I must take counsel with myself. On such nights, the best company.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott still felt unaccountably tired when the alarm clock dragged him up from the depths of a troubled sleep. It was just before eight in the morning. He rose reluctantly, showered, shaved, made his way to Finlayson's room, and was about to knock when the door was opened by Dr. Blake. At that time of the morning the doctor's beaked nose, hollow cheeks and sunken eyes lent him a more cadaverous</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, come in, Mr. Dermott. I've finished with Finlayson. Was just about to send for his casket. He and the two engineers from Pump Station Four are being flown out at nine-thirty. I understand you're going with them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. You have caskets?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Macabre, you think? Well, we do keep a few tucked away. Apart from natural illnesses, this is an accident-prone profession, and we have to be prepared. You can't very well whistle up an undertaker from Fairbanks or Anchorage at a moment's notice.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I suppose not.&quot; Dermott nodded at the dead man. &quot;Any luck in establishing the cause of death?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, normally it requires a full autopsy to discover whether a victim has been suffering from cerebrovascular disease or cardiac arrest. Fortunately—or unfortunately—it wasn't necessary in this case.&quot; Blake sounded grim. &quot;What would be natural causes elsewhere are unnatural here. John Finlayson was murdered.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How? B&laquo;yond exposure?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None of your usual methods. He was rendered unconscious and left to die in the cold. Clad as he was in these abnormally low temperatures, I'd say his heart must have stopped in under a minute.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How was he knocked out?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sandbagged. In the classic spot, at the base of the neck. An expert. You can see the slight contusion and roughness there. A contusion can only be caused by blood still circulating, so he was clearly alive after the blow. The cold killed him.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Big, burly, high-colored and irrepressibly cheerful, John Ffoulkes looked more like a prosperous farmer than a tough, competent senior police officer. He produced a bottle of whiskey and two glasses and smiled at Dermott.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In view of those ridiculous prohibition laws they have up at Prudhoe Bay, maybe we can make up here in Anchorage...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My chief would like your style. We don't do so badly there. Mr. Brady claims to have the biggest portable bar north of the Arctic circle. He has, too.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, then, to help erase the memory of your flight. I gather you didn't enjoy it much?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Extreme turbulence, an absence of pretty stewardesses, and the knowledge that you're carrying three murdered men in the cargo hold doesn't make for a very relaxed flight.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ffoulkes stopped smiling. &quot;Ah, yes, the dead men. Not only a tragic affair, but an extremely unpleasant one. I've had reports from my own State</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Troopers and the FBI. I wonder if you could have anything to add to what they said?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I doubt it. Mr. Morrison of the FBI struck me as a highly competent officer.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's all that, and a close friend of mine. But tell me anyway, please.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott's account was as- succinct as it was comprehensive. At the end Ffoulkes said, &quot;Tallies almost exactly with the other reports. But no hard facts?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Suspicions, yes. Hard facts, no.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So the only lead you really have are the prints we got from that telephone booth?&quot; Dermott nodded, and Ffoulkes brought out a buff folder from a desk drawer. &quot;Here they are. Some are pretty smudged but a few are not too bad. Are you an expert?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can read them with a powerful glass and a lot of luck. But an expert—no.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've got a first-class young lad here. Like to borrow him for a day or two?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott hesitated. &quot;That's kind. But I don't want to tread on Mr. Morrison's toes. He's got his own man up there.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not in the same class as our David Hendry. Mr. Morrison won't object.&quot; He pressed an intercom button and gave an order.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">David Hendry was fair-haired, smiling and seemed ridiculously young to be a police officer. After introductions, Ffoulkes said, &quot;Lucky lad. How do you fancy a vacation in a winter wonderland?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Hendry looked cautious. &quot;Which wonderland, sir?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Prudhoe Bay.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Report back in an hour, David.&quot; Hendry opened the door to leave, then stood to one side as a lean man, white-bearded like an Old Testament prophet, bustled into the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Apologies, John, apologies. Couldn't have caught me at a worse time or on a worse day. Two court cases, two suicides—people get more thoughtless every day.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What is?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My two assistants. Coming down with the flu at the busiest time of the year. This modern generation—&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I daresay they couldn't help it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Namby-pambies. What happened to those three anyway?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two we know for sure. They were in the close vicinity of an explosion. After that an oil fire broke out. Savagely scarred. The fumes alone would have finished them off.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But they were already finished off. So. Blasted to death, burned, asphyxiated. Doesn't leave very much for an old sawbones like me to do, does it?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hah! So you want them out, is that it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not me, Dr. Parker. The State Police and the FBI. I'm no cop, just an oil-field sabotage investigator.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ffoulkes smiled. &quot;What odds would you offer, Mr. Dermott?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;About a million to one that they'll be wasted. That gun has almost certainly been tossed out of a helicopter somewhere over the Brooks Range.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fll still have to ask you, Charles,&quot; said Ffoulkes.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes.&quot; Dermott nodded to Ffoulkes' desk. &quot;That's his death certificate.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Parker picked it up, screwed on a pince-nez and read through the report.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Unusual,&quot; he said testily. &quot;But it seems a straightforward medical report to me. There's no autopsy required here.&quot; He peered at Dermott. &quot;From your expression, you appear to disagree.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm neither agreeing nor disagreeing. I'm just vaguely unhappy.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So was Dr. Crippen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You read into my words what you choose,&quot; Dermott said flatly. &quot;I'm insinuating nothing. I merely say that his examination was perfunctory and hurried, and that he may have missed something. You wouldn't claim a divine right of infallibility for doctors?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would not.&quot; His voice was still testy, but only a testy mutter now. &quot;What is it you want?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A second opinion.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's a damned unusual request.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a damned unusual murder.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ffoulkes looked, quizzically at Dermott and said, &quot;I'll look in at Prudhoe Bay tomorrow. There's nothing like adding a touch of chaos to an existing state of confusion.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott and David Hendry flew in from Anchorage to Prudhoe Bay in the leaden twilight of late afternoon to find the weather distinctly improved, with the wind down to ten knots, the top of the drifting snow cloud not more than five feet above ground level, visibility in the plane's headlights almost back to normal, and the temperature at least twenty degrees higher than in the morning. In the administration building lounge the first recognizable face Dermott saw was that of Morrison of the FBI, who was sitting with a young, ginger-haired man incongruously dressed in gray flannels and blazer. Morrison looked up and smiled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Trust John Ffoulkes,&quot; he said. &quot;No faith in the FBI.&quot; He gestured toward the ginger-haired young man. &quot;Nick Turner.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No dice. We've done it.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Close enough. Lots of unsatisfactory smudges which can only be Finlayson's, a couple belonging to a plumber who was there on his rounds, and one— would you believe it, just one—belonging to the bull cook, who must be a real whiz-kid with duster and polishing cloth.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bull cook?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could some other industrious soul have been busy in there with a duster?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Morrison produced two keys. &quot;His room key and the master key. Had them in my pocket since Fin-layson was taken out this morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Here endeth the lesson.&quot; Dermott laid the buff folder on the low table before Morrison. &quot;Prints from the Anchorage phone booth. Now, I must go and report to the boss.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Morrison said, &quot;It should amuse the two young gentlemen here to compare your Anchorage prints with the ones in the office safe.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You don't sound very optimistic,&quot; Dermott said.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why prime?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;For having the keys that opened the Sanmobil armor door, for having given the keys to those who did. Third, they're security men.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady smiled blandly. &quot;You're bushed, George. You're becoming paranoid about the security men of the great northwest.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady scowled but said nothing, so Dermott changed the subject. &quot;How did the day go?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No progress. Along with Morrison we interviewed every man on the base. Every one had a cast-iron alibi for the night of the explosion in Pump Station Four. So it's'all clear there.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Except,&quot; Dermott persisted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who do you mean?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bronowski and Houston.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady glowered at his chief operative and shook his head. &quot;You're paranoid, George, I say it again. Shit, we <I>know </I>they were both out there. Bronowski's been hurt, and Houston didn't <I>have </I>to find Finlayson. If he <I>had </I>been crooked, it would have suited him far better to let the drifting snow obliterate every last trace of Finlayson. What do you say to that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Three things. The fact that we know they were out at the pump station makes them <I>more </I>suspect, not less.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Second guessing,&quot; growled Brady. &quot;Hate second guessing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No doubt. But we've agreed that the bombers must be people working on the pipeline. We've eliminated everyone else, so it has to be them—does it not?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady did not answer. Dermott went on, &quot;The third thing is this: There must be some reason, albeit devious, why Bronowski was clobbered and Houston made the discovery. Look at it this way. What evidence do we have that Bronowski <I>was </I>assaulted? The only certain thing we know about him is that he's lying in the sick-bay with an impressive bandage around his head. I don't think there's a damn thing wrong with Bronowski. I don't think anybody hit him. I suggest that if the bandage were removed,</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady assumed the expression of a man praying for inner strength. &quot;So, besides not trusting security men, you don't trust doctors, either?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Some I do. Some I don't. I've already told you that I'm leery of Blake.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay, then.&quot; Brady didn't enlarge on this brief statement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We also rounded up the Prudhoe Bay members who were in Anchorage on the night of that telephone call,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;Fourteen in all. They seemed a pretty harmless bunch to me. However, Morrison of the FBI did call up the law in Anchorage, gave names and addresses and asked them to see if they could turn up anything.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You printed those fourteen, right?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. One of Morrison's assistants did. Some Ivy League kid.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No objections offered?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None. They seemed eager to co-operate.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Proves nothing. Anyway, I brought along the prints found on the phone booth. They're being checked now against the prints of the fourteen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That won't take long,&quot; Mackenzie said. &quot;Give them a call, shall I?&quot; He called, listened briefly, hung up and said to Dermott, &quot;Cassandra.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So.&quot; Brady looked positively lugubrious, no easy feat for a man without a line in his face. &quot;Houston's finest have run into a brick wall.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let's not reproach ourselves too much,&quot; Dermott said. He looked less downcast than the other two. &quot;Our business is investigating oil sabotage, not</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">murder, which <I>is </I>the province of the FBI and the Alaskan State Police. They appear to have run into the same brick wall. Besides, we may have the lead into another line of investigation—John Finlayson's autopsy.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Huh!&quot; Brady gave a contemptuous lift of his hands. &quot;That's over. It turned up nothing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The first one didn't. But the second one might.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;What! <I>Another </I>autopsy?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The first one was pretty superficial and perfunctory.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Unprecedented.&quot; Brady shook his head. &quot;Who the hell authorized this?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nobody really. I did <I>ask </I>for it, but politely.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady cursed, whether because of Dermott's words or because he had spilled a goodly portion of a daiquiri over his immaculately trousered knee. He refilled his glass, breathed deeply and said, &quot;Took your own goddamned good time in getting around to telling us, didn't you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Everything in its own good time, Jim. Just a matter of getting priorities right. It'll be a couple of days before we get the results of this autopsy. I really can't see why you are getting so steamed up.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can damn well tell you. Who the hell gave you the authorization to make such a request without first getting permission from me?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nobody did.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You had time before you left here this morning to discuss the matter with me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure I had time, but I hadn't had the idea by then. I was halfway down to Anchorage before it occurred to me that there could be something far wrong. Do you imagine I'd talk to you in Prudhoe Bay over an open line?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">hotbed of espionage,&quot; Brady came back at him sarcastically.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It only requires one disaffected ear, and we might as well pack our bags and return to Houston. We already know how good those people are at covering their tracks.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;George.&quot; It was Mackenzie. &quot;You've made your point. What triggered your suspicions?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dr. Blake. You know that as far as the murdered engineers at Pump Station Four and Bron-owski's alleged accident were concerned, I already had reservations about Blake. I began to wonder if there was anything that could tie Blake in with Fin-layson's death. I was the only person who saw the body between the completion of Blake's autopsy and the time the lid was screwed down on the coffin.&quot; Dermott stopped to sip.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;During that period Blake showed me marks on the back of the neck where, he said, Finlayson had been sandbagged into unconsciousness. On the plane it occurred to me that I had never seen a bruise or contusion of that nature. There was no sign of discoloration, or of swelling. It seemed to me more than likely that the skin had been roughed up after death. Blake said Finlayson had been struck by a bag of damp salt. His neck smelled of salt all right, but it could have been rubbed on during the night, after the body had been brought back up to the room. If he <I>had </I>been coshed, the vertebrae would have been depressed or broken.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said, &quot;Obvious question—were they?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't know. They looked okay to me. But Dr. Parker will know.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dr. Parker?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Works along with the Anchorage police in a forensic capacity. Struck me as a very bright old boy.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">My request wasn't too well received at first. Like yourselves, he regarded the concept of a second autopsy as unprecedented or unconstitutional or whatever. He read Blake's death certificate and seemed to think it perfectly in order.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But you persuaded him to the contrary?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not exactly. He promised nothing. But he seemed interested enough to do something.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;You <I>are </I>a persuasive cuss, George.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott paused reflectively. &quot;It may be nothing, or it may be another straw in the wind—but Dr. Parker has never heard of Dr. Blake.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady resumed his favorite steeple-fingered pontificating attitude. &quot;You're aware that Alaska is more than half the size of Western Europe?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm also aware that in Western Europe there must be a hundred million people. In Alaska, a few hundred thousand. I'd be surprised, if, outside the few hospitals, there are more than sixty or seventy doctors, and a veteran like Parker would be bound to know or know of them all.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady unsteepled his fingertips and said, &quot;There is hope for you. An immediate investigation into Doctor Blake's antecedents would appear to be in order.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Immediate,&quot; Mackenzie agreed. &quot;Morrison's the man for that. Wouldn't it be interesting, too, to have a run-down on the man who appointed or recommended Blake to this post?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It would,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;And it would certainly narrow the field a bit. I wonder. You remember just after we arrived here asking whether there were any ideas about the type of weapon used on Bronowski, and Morrison said—I think I quote him accurately—'Dr. Blake says he's no specialist in criminal acts of violence'?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady nodded.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So. This morning, when I was with him in Finlayson's room discussing the reasons for the man's death, he mentioned in an off-hand way that he used to be an expert in the forensic field. Obviously, he said it to lend credence to his diagnosis. But it was a slip, all the same. One time or the other, he was lying.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott looked at Brady and asked, &quot;Your agents in New York who are investigating Bron-owski's security firm there—they aren't, shall we say, exactly burning up the track. Give them a nudge?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Negative. You said yourself that an open line...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who's talking about an open line? We do it through Houston, in your code.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Huh! That damn code. You encode any message you like and authorize it in my name.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie winked unobtrusively, but Dermott ignored him and began to spell.out the message to the telephone operator. It said much for his mastery of a code which its inventor found insupportably burdensome that he encoded the words straight out of his head, without having to make a prior transcript.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He had barely finished when a knock on the door announced the arrival of Hamish Black. The pencil moustache on the Alaskan general manager was as immaculately trimmed as ever, the central parting of the hair still apparently drawn by ruler, the eyeglass so securely anchored that it looked as if it could have ridden out a hurricane.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Come in, come in.&quot; Brady was affability itself, a sure sign that he didn't care too much for his visitor. &quot;Make yourself at home.&quot; He glanced around the cramped confines of his room and at the already occupied chairs. &quot;Well—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, I'll stand. I shall not detain you for long.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A drink? One of my incomparable rum drinks? How about a cigar?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you. I neither smoke nor drink.&quot; The minuscule twitch of the left-hand corner of his upper lip clearly indicated his opinion of those who did. &quot;I have come here because in my capacity of general manager of Sohio/BP I felt it my duty to ask how much progress you have made in your investigations to date.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;What have we found out so far? Well—&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;George!&quot; Brady made a downward placatory movement of the hand toward a Dermott who was already halfway out of his seat. He looked coldly at Black. &quot;We are not employees of yours, Mr. Black. We are not even retained by you, but directly by your head office in London. I suggest that if you want to leave this room the way you entered it, you watch your language.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">viously in a hostile mood. Our progress so far? Not much. Would there be anything else?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black was clearly taken aback. It is difficult for an old-time man-of-war to attack when the wind has been taken out of its sails.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So you admit—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No admission. We're just making a statement. Can we be of further help?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Indeed you can. You can explain to me the justification for your staying on here. The firm can scarcely afford the fees you seem likely to charge, if it gets no advantage. You have achieved nothing, and seem unlikely to achieve anything. You investigate industrial sabotage, specifically oil-flow interruption. There is, I suggest, a considerable difference between the spilling of oil and the spilling of blood. One cannot but suspect but that you are out of your depth and that events are beyond your control. One further suspects that the investigation should be left to those qualified to investigate criminal matters—the FBI and the Alaskan State Police.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We'd be interested to know what they've found out. Or don't you feel free to tell us?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black compressed his lips still tighter. Mackenzie said, &quot;May I have a word, Mr. Brady?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I couldn't really say.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To return to your earlier attitude, Mr. Black,&quot; Mackenzie persisted, &quot;on that occasion Mr. Dermott said he thought you might have something to hide. Mr. Brady suggested you were being unduly secretive and had—what was it again?—some undisclosed and possibly discreditable reason for choosing to obstruct the best interests of your company. Reasonable requests you regarded as being preposterous. Finally, as I recall, Mr. Dermott said that you were either standing on your high horse as general manager, Alaska, and were above such petty annoyances, or that you were concealing something you didn't want us to know about.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know you have a great deal to do, Mr. Black&quot;—two tiny spots of pink appeared on the pale cheekbones, for Mackenzie's tone had made it abundantly clear he didn't believe Black had anything to do—&quot;so I'll keep it short. Your intransigence interests us. You have made it abundantly clear that you would be happy to be rid of us. By your own admission you've acknowledged that we would be back very soon afterward, perhaps even in a matter of days. The conclusion is that you want us out of the way even if for only a brief period. One wonders what you intend to do or have done during that short time?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I see. You leave me with no alternative other <I>, </I>than to report your gross incompetence and insolence <SUP>1</SUP> to my board of directors in London.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the door had closed Dermott said, &quot;Not a bad exit line.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Neither did I.&quot; Brady was positively jovial. He smacked one fat fist into the other pudgy palm. &quot;Tell me, Donald, how much of what you said did you mean?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I asked them to find out if anybody had left Bronowski's security firm within six months before or after Bronowski's leaving.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Maybe Brady's right. Maybe this security bit is getting to you. And even if Bronowski has hauled some of his old associates along with him, they may have changed their names.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hardly matters. Descriptions will be enough. And as for my being bitten by the bug, it's high time you and Jim were too.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So you think the overall co-ordinator must be a security man?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not necessarily. But what I'm sure of is that pretty soon we're going to hear of some fresh calamity that has struck in Athabasca. The master puppeteer must be thinking it's time the puppets were dancing again.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You heard what-I said to Black. That he wants us out for a few days for some purpose. If he can't get rid of us in one way—by asking us to leave-then he'll do it in another by arranging a fresh Athabascan calamity.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie took the list and studied it. His eyebrows went up. &quot;Make Morrison jump, for sure,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't care if he jumps over the moon, as long as he gets on with it when he comes down,&quot; said Dermott heavily. &quot;We've got to get action somewhere.&quot; He was about to say something else when the telephone rang. He picked up the receiver to listen, and gradually his face went chalk white. He seemed not to notice when the glass in his left hand shattered, crushed by the pressure he had put on it, and a little rivulet of blood ran down his palm.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What a <I>place!&quot; </I>exclaimed Stella as she came back into Corinne's office. &quot;Heavens—I had no idea it was so big. We seem to have driven about fifty miles.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, it's quite a size, that's for sure.&quot; Corinne grinned, pleased that her guests had enjoyed themselves. &quot;I hope <I>you </I>found it interesting too, Mrs. Brady?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Incredible!&quot; Jean eased off the hood of her parka and shook her hair loose. &quot;Those draglines— I've never seen anything like them. They're—they're sort of prehistoric monsters, burrowing into the bowels of the earth.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's right!&quot; Stella's imagination had been fired no less. &quot;Brontosauruses. Absolutely. Sure was kind of Mr. Reynolds to fix our tour. <I>And </I>to ask us to supper.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't mention it.&quot; Corinne tried out the deprecating smile she had been cultivating. &quot;We all like having visitors—makes a change. You'll enjoy meeting Mary Reynolds, too. Now, let's see if the boss is ready to leave.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Be right with you,&quot; she said. &quot;All set?&quot; She tidied her desk, locked the drawers, put the keys in her handbag and pulled on a fetching, roly-poly combination suit of powder-blue quilted nylon, as well as a pair of blue fur-topped boots. A moment later Reynolds himself came through the connecting door, similarly muffled in navy blue and white.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Evening, ladies,&quot; he said pleasantly. &quot;Had a good tour, I hope. Not too dull?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not at all!&quot; Jean had no trouble sounding enthusiastic. &quot;It was wonderful. Fascinating.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good.&quot; He turned to Corinne. &quot;Where are our strong-arm boys, then?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Waiting for us in the lobby.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Great. We'd better not leave them behind, or your fattoer'll give us hell.&quot; He winked at Stella and ushered her through the door.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Terry Brinckman, SanmobiPs security chief, and his deputy Jorgensen were hovering in the entrance hall. As the party approached the two men opened the outside door and let in a blast of the Arctic evening. Out on the tarmac one of the firm's yellow-and-black-checkered mini-buses stood ready, with its engine running. Reynolds opened the passenger door, helped Jean and Stella into the front seat, nipped around to the driver's side and slammed the door, cursing the knifelike wind. Corinne hopped into the back seat between the two security men.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As they cruised down toward the main gates Reynolds called up the guard on his two-way radio and identified the vehicle, to save the man coming out into the cold.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The bus was warm and comfortable. The journey would take only twenty minutes. Yet Corinne somehow felt uneasy. Her boss had been on edge all day, and although she had maintained a sunny enough exterior, she wasn't looking forward to the evening. It could be sticky. Maybe they could get a bit of a concert or singsong going—that would help. She leaned forward and asked Stella if she could play guitar.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why, sure—if no one else is listening.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, come on! I thought we could maybe have a singsong.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Course she can play,&quot; Jean said firmly. 'Tick up any tune you care to sing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's great.&quot; Corinne settled back between her two solid escorts. The bus had left the inhabited outskirts of the site and was winding through the low hills that separated the tar sands from Fort McMurray. Reynolds drove smoothly, without violent acceleration or braking, for the surface of the road was dusted with the ever-traveling snow, which flashed and glittered in the headlight beams.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They had just passed a sharp corner which Brinckman said was known as Hangman's Turn when Reynolds <I>did </I>jam on his brakes. He cursed as the bus slewed to the left, then corrected the skid. Ahead, the road was blocked by a black truck which had also skidded sideways-on.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, my God!&quot; Jean cried from up front. &quot;There's been an accident!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You ladies sit tight,&quot; Reynolds ordered sharply. 'Terry, go see what's happened.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brinckman opened his door and got out. Cor-inne felt the blast of air hit her from the right. Then she saw another figure running, or rather staggering, toward them from the stranded vehicle. The man had his hands up, as if to shield his eyes from the minibus's lights. He was limping and lurching; she thought: he's been badly hurt.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Corinne felt Brinckman yank the first-aid box out from under the back seat. Next thing she knew, he was flat on his side, his feet having gone from under him on the ice. He got up at once and advanced more cautiously, with his feet apart, apparently to the aid of the injured man.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">What happened next was so fast that Corinne afterward wondered a hundred times whether or not she had remembered it right. Everything seemed to go into a blur. One moment Brinckman was advancing to meet the crippled figure. Next second the cripple seemed suddenly to shake off his injuries: he stood upright and let fly an expertly timed blow that felled Brinckman like a tree. The instant the man lowered his shielding hand, Corinne saw he was wearing a stocking mask.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stella screamed, &quot;Back up—quick!&quot; Corinne also shouted something. But before any of them could move the attacker was at Reynolds' door. In a second he had wrenched it open and thrown in something that hissed.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">on the floor in the back. From the front she heard stifled screams and ghastly tearing noises as people struggled for breath. Then the gas got her too, and she found herself fighting and choking as if for her life,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In spite of her distress she became aware that the people in front were being dragged out into the snow. She crouched flat on the floor, struggling to control her stinging throat and eyes. Then she heard a man shout, &quot;Where's the other chick? We've only got two.&quot; In the next second she felt someone seize the hood of her combination suit and drag her bodily out onto the road.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Without knowing why, she pretended to be unconscious. Somehow it seemed safer. She felt herself sliding easily along the icy surface, being dragged like a sack of potatoes. Her backside skidded smoothly over the snow. As she was pulled around the front of the minibus, into the headlights, she noticed that the supposedly injured men had vanished. The bus's engine was still running, but the vehicle blocking the road had started up as well. Suddenly she was hoisted and dumped in the open back of the truck.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For the first time she felt afraid—not of being kidnapped, but of freezing to death. In spite of her thick suit she was shivering already, and if they were going to be driven miles in an open truck, the cold would soon kill them all...</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Her fears on that score proved groundless. After a rough, bumpy drive of only a few seconds the truck crunched to a halt. The noise of its motor was suddenly swamped by a far louder, heavier roar that burst out all around and over them. Corinne opened her eyes in terror and saw that they had pulled up beside a gray-white helicopter. Even as she looked</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She felt she should scream or run—but would it do any good? Even a second's hesitation was too long. She felt herself grabbed by shoulders and ankles and swung aboard, again like an inert sack.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The noise was terrific. The engine-roar increased to a furious pitch, but through it she could hear a woman screaming and men yelling. She saw a bundle she recognized as Stella struggling frantically with one of the men in stocking masks, rolling across the bare steel. Another of the men slid the door in the side of the fuselage nearly shut, but he kept his head stuck out through the gap, bellowing at someone still on the ground.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The engine-note rose and fell, rose and fell, as though the pilot was having mechanical difficulty. Then it went up and stayed up—but only for a few seconds. Again it dropped. Corinne had never been in a helicopter before and did not know what to expect. She didn't know whether the pilot was going through his normal take-off routine, or whether he had some problem. What she did notice, however, was that the man who'd been shouting to his colleague on the ground had failed to close the door properly: It still stood a few inches ajar. A desperate idea flashed into her head: At the moment of takeoff, whenever it came, she would dart to the door, drag it open, and fling herself out.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Before she'd had time to evaluate the risks, she felt the floor tilt—they were off already. Then came a heavy bump. Down again, she thought. Next time they did lift. It was then or never.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She rolled over, flung herself at the door and hauled it back. She was hit by a stunningly cold wash of wind. Too late she realized that they were</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">already off the ground. She was caught by the slipstream, whirled around and sucked out. She clutched wildly at the door frame but her gloves slipped uselessly over the bare metal. At the edge of her consciousness she heard a man screaming, &quot;You're crazy! You'll be killed!&quot; Then she was falling through the snow-laden wind. She tumbled over in mid air and glimpsed a pair of headlights snaking through the night way below. That was the last thing she saw. The next couple of seconds would bring her nightmares for the rest of her life. Time stopped. She fell endlessly through the freezing sky, convinced that her body would be smashed to pieces any instant. She tried to scream, but could not. She tried to breathe, but could not. She tried to turn over, but could not alter her attitude in the slightest. She dropped helplessly, rigid with terror. Then she screamed.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The impact was unbelievably gentle. Instead of smashing into iron-hard tundra, she landed in something soft and yielding. She hit it back-first, and went right on down through several feet of blessed cushioning. She was winded by the impact, but that was all. She lay on her back gasping and groaning for breath, but once she had got it back, she began to shake with relief. To her own amazement, she found she was laughing as well as crying. She had landed on her backside in a great big drift of snow.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yeah, and there's a truck stuck in the snow by where the plane took off. It's trying to get back on the road, facing toward Fort McMurray.&quot;</FONT><BR>

Yes—I do.&quot; He explained all he knew in a couple of sentences. &quot;What I want <I>you </I>to do is come right up the road to Hangman's Turn. You see anybody coming to meet you, stop him.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody drove. Jones rode shotgun, his .38 revolver ready in his hand. The Cherokee Jeep station wagon, in four-wheel drive, held the road better than a regular sedan, but even so they had to go carefully.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody swore steadily as he nursed the wheel. &quot;Goddamn it to hell!&quot; he kept muttering. &quot;The first time we leave them, <I>this </I>happens. What in hell were the Sanmobil security guys doing, for Christ's sake?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody stopped in the middle of the road and switched on the station wagon's flashers. The oncoming driver rounded a bend, saw them, braked and slewed violently from side to side before sliding to a halt.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jones got out and moved toward the vehicle. He'd only gone three or four yards when a spurt of fire flashed from the driver's window, followed instantly by the crack of a gun. Jones spun sideways, clutching his left shoulder. The other driver slammed into gear and let out the clutch. For a second his tires raced griplessly on the snow. Then he shot forward, cannoned into the Jeep, shunted it sideways enough for him to scrape past, and accelerated away in the direction of Fort McMurray.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody tried to open his door but found it jammed: the bodywork was buckled all down that side. He hunked across to the other side and ran to the aid of his wounded colleague. Jones was conscious but bleeding badly from a wound in the top corner of his chest—a large, dark stain had spread out across the snow beneath his body.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody thought fast. It was too cold to administer first aid to the wound. If he took off any of Jones's clothes, the man would die of exposure and shock. First priority was to get him somewhere warm, then to hospital. He ought to call up an ambulance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Come on, Bill,&quot; he said gently. &quot;You gotta get up.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In there,&quot; he said. &quot;Front door's jammed.&quot; He got the wounded man safely in, closed the door, climbed aboard himself and turned up the heater to maximum. Then he addressed himself to the radio. To his chagrin, he could get nothing out of it. The set was live, but no signal came through. Something had been broken by the impact of the truck.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For a moment Carmody considered turning and giving chase. Then he realized the other driver had too much start on him. Even with his four-wheel drive, he would never overtake him in the short distance between there and Fort McMurray. He was closer to the Sanmobil plant, in any case. Better get on and make contact with the bus driver who had</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He set off as fast as he dared. Jones was ominously silent, not answering questions about how he felt. Carmody set his jaw and drove through the snow.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Five minutes later he came on the stranded minibus. Immediately he recognized the black-and-yellow checkered MB Five, which he had seen and ridden in many times before. Beyond it a line of vehicles had piled up, the drivers being kept at bay by Johnson, who had told them that the police were about to arrive, and that no one must touch the bus until the cops had checked it out. The beaten-up security men were hunched in the seats of Johnson's bus, apparently comatose.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody sized up the position in a moment. &quot;Get it out of the way,&quot; he ordered. &quot;Let everybody else through.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">waved the other vehicles past. Three back in the line was a Sanmobil truck with two crewmen aboard— the only men Shore had been able to conscript immediately at that late hour. Over Johnson's bus radio Carmody called for police reinforcements and alerted the Sanmobil sick-bay, warning them that three injured men were being brought in. Then he detailed one of the Sanmobil men to drive his own Jeep right onto the plant, with Jones still in it. Brinckman and Jorgensen, unsteady on their feet, also climbed aboard.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Get back in the warm,&quot; Carmody told them. &quot;I'll talk to you guys later.&quot; As they drove off he turned to Johnson: &quot;Okay, so what happened?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I just came on the bus in the middle of the road, like you saw it. The two security guys were lying in front of it, trying to get up. I got out to see what the matter was, and heard the racket of a helicopter engine, right close.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where was it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just over there. I'll show you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He switched on a big flashlight and led the way over the frozen tundra. &quot;Sounded like he had a problem with the motor—kept running it up and letting it die again. Then he <I>did </I>go. Lifted off and headed thataway—north. Here—you can see the ski marks.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In the flashlight beam the imprint of long, heavy skis was still visible, thofigh dusted over with the snow blown about by the rotor's down-draft.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Any markings on the chopper, identification?&quot; Carmody asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing—it was just like a big black shadow against the sky. Couldn't even tell the color &quot;exactly, but it looked off-white. Pair of small fins near the tail too.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">193</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And then what happened? Where did the person fall?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A woman, it was. She screamed. Someplace over there.&quot; Johnson pointed. &quot;Not too far.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How high did she fall from?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Maybe a hundred feet. Maybe more.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Must be dead. We'd better look, all the same. Oh, my God! One of the Bradys killed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They went up an incline into the teeth of the wind. On top of the slope the ground was rounded into smooth, gentle humps. The flashlight beam, sweeping the snow, revealed nothing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Must have been around here,&quot; said Johnson doubtfully. &quot;Can't have been much farther, or I'd never have seen the body at all. Try over there a bit.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They cast a little to their left. Suddenly Car-mody, who had been walking on hard-frozen tundra, sank to his waist in snow. As he exclaimed and struggled to extricate himself from the drift, Johnson called, &quot;Listen, I thought I heard something.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They waited, catching only the whine of the wind. Then Johnson heard the sound again—a cry that sounded faint yet close at hand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There it is!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Sure as hell, someone calling. This way!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They tried to move eastward, but both lunged into the deep snow again and realized that a rift in the ground ran in that direction.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;She's in the snow,&quot; cried Carmody. &quot;Must be. Only way she could have survived the fall.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They regained the hard edge of the invisible miniature valley and followed it another twenty steps. Then they heard the cry again, almost beneath them. This time they shouted back and got an answer. A few more steps brought them to the lip of</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">a hole about a yard across that had been punched vertically downward into the drift. Shining the light down it, they saw a bundle of powder-blue snowsuit.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hey! You! Mrs. Brady? Stella?&quot; Carmody called. &quot;Are you hurt?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; came the muffled answer. &quot;I'm not Mrs. Brady or Stella, and I'm not hurt. Just stuck.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who are you, then?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Corinne Delorme.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Corinne! Heaven's sakes! John Carmody here. Hold on, and we'll get you right out of there.&quot; He sent Johnson running to the truck for a shovel and a rope, and in five minutes they had dug and hoisted the girl out. Considering she had been outdoors for more than half an hour, she was in remarkably good shape, mainly because the snow had insulated her and given her complete protection from the wind. But as soon as they got her into the warmth of the truck cab, reaction set in and she began to shudder uncontrollably.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody's first impulse was to drive her to hospital, but then he changed his mind. Something— he could not quite tell what—made him favor a more devious approach. The guys in the helicopter must reckon she was dead. They must think they had another murder on their hands. It was a million-to-one that, she had fallen into the drifted-up ravine rather than onto the ground: five yards to either side, and every bone in her body would have been broken. Something might be gained, Carmody thought, if the kidnappers did not realize anyone had survived. Therefore he decided to move her away into safekeeping, at any rate until Brady and his team returned.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Know what I want you to do?&quot; Carmody said to Johnson. &quot;Drive Miss Delorme to the isolation</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">unit on the plant. The <I>isolation </I>unit. When you reach the main gates, have her keep down out of sight, on the floor. I don't want anyone to know where she is. Any bother, say you're on a special run for Mr. Shore. Okay?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Johnson nodded.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You hear that, Corinne?&quot; Carmody lifted up her chin. &quot;He'll take you to a good place at Athabasca. Nice and warm and comfortable. Out of the way, too. I'll see you back there as soon as I can make it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shock and reaction had knocked the girl to pieces for the moment, and she could not answer.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Go on, then,&quot; Carmody told Johnson. &quot;Drive.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">Twelve</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was past midnight and still snowing heavily when Jim Brady arrived back in Fort McMurray, but the lobby of the Peter Pond Hotel was as crowded and bustling with activity as if it had been just after noon. Brady sank wearily into a chair and for the first time waved off a drink. The flight from Prudhoe Bay had been a grim one: between them, Brady, Dermott and Mackenzie had uttered hardly a word.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A tall, lean man, dark-moustached and heavily tanned, approached. &quot;Mr. Brady? My name's Wil-loughby. Glad to make your acquaintance, sir, though not in these damnable circumstances.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah—the police chief.&quot; Brady smiled without humor. &quot;And rough for you, Mr. Willoughby, to have this happen in your territory. I was sorry to hear that one of your men had been killed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm glad to say that report was premature. There was a great deal of confusion around here when we made that phone call to you. The man was shot through the left lung and certainly looked bad, but now the doctor says he has a more than even chance.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's something.&quot; Brady smiled wanly again. 197</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby turned to two other men. &quot;D'you know...?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Those two gentlemen I've met,&quot; said Brady. &quot;Mr. Brinckman, Sanmobil security chief, and his deputy, Mr. Jorgensen. Odd—for a couple of reportedly injured men, you look remarkably fit to me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brinckman said, &quot;We don't exactly feel it. Like Mr. Willoughby said, things got exaggerated in the heat of the moment. No broken bones, no knife or gun injuries, but they did knock us about a bit.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Pete Johnson—the guy who raised the alarm— will vouch for that,&quot; said Willoughby. &quot;When he got there, Jorgensen was lying on the road, out cold, and Brinckman was wandering around in a daze. He didn't know if it was last night or last month.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady turned to another man who had appeared at his side. &quot;Evening, Mr. Shore. Morning, rather. The Brady family seem to have disturbed a lot of people's sleep, I'm afraid.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To hell with that.&quot; Shore was visibly upset. &quot;I helped show Mrs. Brady and your daughter around the plant yesterday. That this should happen to her. Just as bad, that this should happen to you when you and your family were virtually our guests and you were trying to help us. A black day and a black eye for Sanmobil.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Maybe not all that black,&quot; said Dermott. &quot;God knows, it must be a traumatic experience to be kidnapped, but I don't believe any of the four is in immediate danger. We're not dealing with political fanatics such as you get in Europe or the Mideast. We're up against hard-headed business men with no personal animosity against their victims. They almost certainly regard them as bargaining counters.&quot; He clasped and unclasped his big hands. &quot;They're going to make demands, probably outrageous, for the</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">return of the captives, and if those demands are met, they'll honor the bargain. Professional kidnappers usually do. In their own twisted terms, it's sound business practice and plain common sense.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady turned to Willoughby. &quot;We haven't really heard what happened. I assume you haven't had time to make wide-ranging inquiries?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Afraid not.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They've just vanished into thin air?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thin air is right. Helicopter, as you heard. They could be a few hundred miles away in any direction by this time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Any chance of airfield radars having picked up their flight path?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, sir. It's a million to one that they were flying below radar level. Besides, there are more palm trees in northern Alberta than there are radar stations. Down south, it's different. We've alerted the stations there to keep a watch, but nothing's been reported so far.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well&quot;—Brady steepled his fingers, sinking back in his chair—&quot;it might help if we could have a brief chronological account of what happened.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That won't take long. Jay?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shore said, &quot;Yes. I was the last person to see them, apart from these two&quot;—he pointed at Brinck-man and Jorgensen. &quot;They left in one of Sanmobil's minibuses, with Bill Reynolds driving.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie cut in, &quot;Were there any phone calls before they left?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wouldn't know. Why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let me ask another question.&quot; Mackenzie looked at Brinckman. &quot;How did the kidnappers stop your bus?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They had a truck slewed across the road. Blocked it completely.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">200</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It couldn't have been there long. There's a fair bit of traffic on that road, and drivers wouldn't take kindly to being held up. Was there, in fact, any other traffic at the time?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't think so. No.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby said, &quot;Your point, Mr. Mackenzie?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Plain as a pikestaff. The kidnappers were tipped off. They knew the precise time when Reynolds' bus left and when it could be expected at the interception point. Phone or short-wave radio—even a CB would have been enough. Two things are for sure— there was an informer, and he came from Sanmobil.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Impossible!&quot; Shore sounded shocked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing else makes sense,&quot; said Brady. &quot;Mackenzie's right.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good God!&quot; Shore sounded outraged. &quot;You make Sanmobil sound like a criminals' den.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's not a Sunday school,&quot; said Brady heavily.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott turned back to Brinckman. &quot;So Reynolds pulled up when he saw this truck across the road? Then?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It was all so quick. There were two men lying in the road. One was face-down and very still, as if he were hurt real bad. The other was moving—he'd both hands clutching at the small of his back and was rolling from side to side. He seemed to be in agony. Two other men came running toward us— well, hardly running, more staggering. One was limping badly, and he had an arm stuck inside his mackinaw jacket as if he was trying to support it. Both of them had a hand up in front of their faces, covering their eyes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Didn't that strike you as odd?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not at all. It was dark, and we had our headlights on. It seemed natural they should shield their eyes from the glare.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">201</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was a pause. Then Brinckman went on, &quot;Well—this guy with the damaged arm—as I thought—came weaving up to my side of the bus, I grabbed the first-aid box and jumped out. I slipped on the ice, and by the time I had my balance I saw the man had dropped his hand and was wearing a stocking mask. Then I saw his left arm coming up. It was almost a blur, but I could see he had some kind of a sap in his hand. I had no time to react.&quot; He fingered his forehead gingerly. &quot;That's all, I guess.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott crossed to him and examined the contusion on the side of his forehead. &quot;Nasty. Could have been worse, though. An inch or so further back and you'd likely have had a fractured temple. Looks as if your friend was using lead shot. A leather bludgeon wouldn't have done that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brinckman stared at him in an odd fashion. &quot;Lead, you reckon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I should think so.&quot; Dermott turned to Jorgen-sen. &quot;I take it you hadn't much better luck?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;At least I wasn't blackjacked. I just thought my jaw had been broken. The other guy was either a heavyweight champion, or he was clutching something heavy in his fist. I couldn't see. He jerked open Mr. Reynolds' door, flung in some kind of smoke bomb, then banged the door shut again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Tear gas,&quot; said Willoughby. &quot;You can see his eyes are still inflamed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I got out,&quot; Jorgensen went on. &quot;I waved my gun around, but it might have been a water pistol, the use it was. I was blind. Next thing I remember, Pete Johnson was trying to shake some sense into us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So, of course, you don't know how Reynolds and his passengers made out.&quot; Jim Brady looked around. He was taking over. &quot;Where's Carmody?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Down at the station,&quot; said Shore. &quot;Still mak-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good.&quot; Brady turned back to Brinckman. &quot;The man who attacked you—was he wearing gloves?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm not sure.&quot; Brinckman thought and then said, &quot;Once he'd passed out of the beam of the headlights, he was in pretty deep shadow, and, as I said, it all happened so damn quickly. But I don't think so.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your man, Mr. Jorgensen?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I could see his hand pretty clearly as he threw the tear-gas canister. No—no glove.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, gentlemen. Mr. Willoughby, a few questions if I may.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Go ahead.&quot; Willoughby cleared his throat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This truck the kidnappers used—you say it was stolen?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's right.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's been identified?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Belongs to a local garage proprietor. It was known he was off on a couple of days' hunting trip.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;At this time of year?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your true enthusiast goes hunting any time. At all events, it was seen passing through the streets yesterday afternoon, and we assumed the owner was taking it along for his trip.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Which argues a fairly intimate local knowledge?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure, but no help to us.&quot; Willoughby smoothed his dark moustache. &quot;Fort McMurray's no longer a village.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Have you fingerprinted the truck, inside and out?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Being done now. It's a long job—there are hundreds of prints.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;May we see them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course. I'll have them photostated. But,</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">with respect, Mr. Brady, what do you hope to achieve that we, the police, can't?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You never know.&quot; Brady smiled enigmatically. &quot;Mr. Dermott here is an international expert in fingerprinting.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I didn't know!&quot; Willoughby smiled at Dermott, who smiled back. He hadn't known either.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady changed his tack. &quot;Any chance of identifying the helicopter from the measurements of the ski marks that Carmody took?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby shook his head. &quot;It was a good idea to record them, but no—the chances of identifying any one machine from its skiprints are extremely remote, because there will almost certainly be dozens of its particular type around. This is helicopter country, Mr. Brady, like Alaska. Here in northern Alberta our communications are still very primitive. We have no divided highways—freeways—in this part of the world. In fact, north of Edmonton there are only two paved roads that reach up north. Between them— nothing. Apart from ourselves, and Peace River and Fort Chipewyan, there are no commercial airports in an area of two hundred thousand square miles.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So,&quot; Brady nodded. &quot;You use choppers.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The preferred form of transport at all times. In winter, the only form.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a good bet that an intensive air search wouldn't have a hope in hell of locating the getaway machine?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None. I've made a bit of a study of kidnapping, and I can answer you best by a comparison. The world's most kidnap-happy place is Sardinia. It's a kind of national pastime there. Whenever a millionaire is snatched, all the resources of the law and the Italian armed forces are brought into play. The Navy blockades harbors and virtually every fishing village</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">on the coast. The Army sets up roadblocks, and specially trained troops sweep the hills. The Air Force carries out exhaustive reconnaissance by plane and helicopter. In all the years these searches have been carried out, they've never yet located a single kidnapper's hideout. Alberta is twenty-seven times larger than Sardinia. Our resources are a fraction of theirs. Answer your question?&quot; -</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One begins to feel the first faint twinges of despair. But tell me, Mr. Willoughby, if you had four kidnapped people on your hands, where would you hide them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Edmonton or Calgary.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But those are towns. Surely...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Cities, yes—and the population of each must be crowding half a million. The captives wouldn't be hidden—they'd be lost.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well.&quot; Brady pulled himself up in his chair. He looked weary. &quot;Okay. I suppose we have to wait word from the kidnappers before we make a move. You two gentlemen&quot;—he turned to Brinckman and Jorgensen—&quot;I don't think we need keep you any longer. Thank you for your co-operation.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The two security men said their good nights and left. Brady hoisted himself to his feet. &quot;No sign of Car-mody yet? Let's go and make ourselves more comfortable while we wait for him. The desk will no doubt inform us when he arrives. This way, gentlemen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once in the privacy of his own room, armed now with a fresh drink, Brady seemed suddenly to shake, off his exhaustion.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay, George,&quot; he said briskly. &quot;You've been holding out on us. Why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                     </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">205</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In what way?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't pussyfoot. You said you were more concerned about the demands the crooks are going to make than about my family. You love my family. Now what did you mean?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The first demand will be that you, Don and I take off for Houston. They must be convinced we're on the verge of a breakthrough.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The second demand will be a ransom message. To keep things within reasonable bounds they can hardly ask for more than a couple of million dollars. But that would be peanuts compared with the stakes our friends are playing for.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Third, the greater stakes. Obviously, they'll demand a fortune to cease their harassment of both Prudhoe Bay's and Sanmobil's oil supplies, and the increasing destruction of their equipment. That's where they hold all the aces. As we've seen, both systems are embarrassingly vulnerable to attack. For as long as the criminals' identity remains undiscovered, they can keep on destroying both systems piecemeal.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Their price will be high. I imagine they'll base it on the development cost of the two systems—that's ten billion for starters—plus the daily revenue, which is the cost of over two million barrels a day. Five per cent of the total? Ten? Depends what the market will bear. One thing's for sure—if they demand too much and price themselves out of the market, the oil companies are going to cut their losses and run, leaving the insurance companies to hold the baby—and it will surely be the most expensive baby in insurance history.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said querulously, &quot;Why didn't you bring this up downstairs?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have an aversion to talking too much in crowded hotel foyers.&quot; Dermott leaned toward Jay</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shore. &quot;Did your Edmonton office send the fingerprints we asked for?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have them in the safe at home.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good.&quot; Dermott nodded approval, but Willoughby was curious, &quot;What prints?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shore hesitated until he received an all-but-imperceptible nod from Dermott, and said, &quot;Mr. Brady and his men seem pretty well convinced that we have at Sanmobil one or more subversives actively aiding and abetting the men trying to destroy us. Mr. Dermott particularly suspects our security staff and all those who have access to our safe.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby shot Dermott a cool, quizzical look. It was clear that he considered the matter one for the Canadian police and not for foreign amateurs. &quot;Would you mind explaining why?&quot; he asked coldly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They're the only suspects we have—especially the men in charge of the security shifts. Not only do they have access to the key of the armory from which the explosives were stolen, they actually carry the damn thing around with them on duty. More, I have good reason to suspect the security staff on the Alaskan pipeline. Further, it appears more than likely that both security staffs are working hand-in-glove under the same boss or bosses. How else can you explain how the terrorists here know the Sohio/BP code, while the criminals there know Sanmobil's?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby said, &quot;This is just conjecture...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure. But it's conjecture shading into probability. Isn't it a basic police philosophy to set up a theory and examine it from all sides before discarding it? Well, we've set up our theory, examined it from all sides, and don't feel like discarding it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby frowned, then said, &quot;You don't trust the security men?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let me amplify that. The majority are straight,</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">no doubt; but until I know for sure, they're all under suspicion.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Including Brinckman and Jorgensen?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;'Including' is not the word. 'Especially'.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jesus! You're talking crazy, Dermott. After what they went through?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Tell me what they went through.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They told you already.&quot; Willoughby had become incredulous.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott was unmoved. &quot;I've only got their word for that—and I'm pretty sure in both cases that word's worthless.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Carmody corroborated their story—or rather, Johnson did. Maybe you don't trust him either?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll decide that when I meet him. But the point is, Johnson <I>didn't </I>corroborate the story. All he said— correct me if I'm wrong—was that when he arrived on the scene he found Brinckman unconscious and Jorgensen staggering around. That's all he said. He had no more idea what went on before that than you or I do.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then how d'you account for their injuries?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Injuries?&quot; Dermott smiled sarcastically. &quot;Jorgensen didn't have a mark on him. Brinckman did, but if you'd been watching him, you'd have seen him jump when I told him he'd been struck by a lead-filled club. That didn't fit. There was something wrong with the scenario.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I suggest both men were in perfectly good health until they saw the lights of Johnson's minibus approaching, whereupon Jorgensen, acting on instructions, tapped Brinckman on the head just hard enough to lay him out briefly.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean, 'on instructions'?&quot; Willoughby demanded doggedly. &quot;Whose?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That remains to be discovered. But you might</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">like to know that these aren't the first peculiar injuries we've come across. A doctor in Prudhoe Bay, for one, has discovered that we have highly suspicious minds on this subject. Donald and I had to examine a murdered engineer whose finger had sustained a curious fracture. The good doctor explained it away to his own apparent satisfaction, but not to ours. He probably gave orders that if any other such—ah—marginal incidents happened, any security agents in the vicinity were to display proof of injuries sustained in the loyal execution of their duties—such as, in this case, their attempts to protect those whom they were supposed to be protecting.&quot; ,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby stared at him and muttered, &quot;You have to be fantacizing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott answered, &quot;We'll see.&quot; But his reply was cut short by the sudden arrival of Carmody and Johnson. Both men looked pale and exhausted—a condition Brady sought to remedy by providing them with very large scotches.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After a suitable pause for congratulation on his night's work, Carmody was taken through his account, step by step. The exercise proved disappointing until, when he came to describe the scene of the helicopter ski marks, he suddenly became tongue-tied. He broke off in mid-sentence and stammered, &quot;Say, Mr. Brady, could I—er—could I talk with you <I>privately?&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well!&quot; Brady was somewhat taken aback. &quot;By all means—but what purpose would it serve? These gentlemen enjoy my fullest confidence. Say what you want in their hearing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay, then. It's about the girl—Corinne...&quot; Whereupon he told them the story of the rescue. Amazement swiftly and thoroughly woke up his audience. They crowded forward, listening intently.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Maybe I was wrong,&quot; Carmody-ended up, &quot;but I just figured that if news of her survival didn't get out, it might be a card up our sleeve.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You figured correctly,&quot; Jim Brady said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where is she, then?&quot; asked Dermott sharply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Right now she's in the isolation unit at the plant. She went a bit hysterical,-with the reaction, but she's all right.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott let out a whoosh of air and said, &quot;My, oh my!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A very original observation, George,&quot; Brady remarked wryly. &quot;Do I detect a certain... pleasure on your part that the young lady is alive and well and in safe hands?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You do,&quot; said Dermott. Then he added quickly, as if feeling he had been overenthusiastic, &quot;And why not?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Point is, I took a statement from her,&quot; Carmody went on. &quot;Want to hear it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly,&quot; Brady said. &quot;Fire away.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The statement still existed only in Carmody's notebook, and so took some time to read. The beginning of it merely confirmed what had been established already—but then came a revelation. After the hold-up, the girl reported, &quot;One man came staggering toward us along the road.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;One </I>man?&quot; snapped Dermott, half-rising out of his chair. &quot;Did she say <I>one </I>man?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's what she said.&quot; Carmody resumed his recitation, backtracking a sentence to emphasize her account. &quot;'I saw two men lying in the road, like they were hurt. One was dead still. The other could move a bit. Then one other man came limping back toward us. He had a hand up in front of his eyes. Mr. Brinck-man was sitting on my right. He jumped out and grabbed the first-aid box from under the seat. I think</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">he slipped and fell over. Then he got up again. Then I saw the other man straighten up and hit him. He went down—Mr. Brinckman, that is. The other man had a stocking mask on—I could see that by now. He opened the door where Mr. Reynolds was sitting and threw something into the bus...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's it!&quot; cried Dermott, smiting his fist on the coffee table. &quot;We got them!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady glowered at him. &quot;Would you favor us slower brethren with an explanation?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">'The whole thing was a frame-up. They told us a load of garbage. They said <I>two </I>men came at them, to make it seem more realistic that they hadn't put up any resistance. Now it's obvious they didn't <I>try </I>to resist. They were part of the act. Jorgensen just sat there watching his partner get slugged.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How come he wasn't much affected by the tear gas?&quot; Brady asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He was prepared for it, of course,&quot; Dermott replied instantly. &quot;If you screw your eyes shut and hold your breath, tear gas has very little effect on you. Jorgensen only had to hold out for a couple of seconds before opening his own door and getting into the fresh air. Listen to what the girl said. There were no bodies left on the road when she was dragged away. Every damn one of them had got up, right as rain, to help get the captives aboard the chopper. It was only when they saw Johnson's headlights coming that Brinckman and Jorgensen resumed their artistic poses on the road.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby muttered a curse. &quot;I believe you're right,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;I really do. And we haven't a shred of hard evidence against them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No way you could dream up a charge and haul them in for preventive detention?&quot; asked Dermott hopefully.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;None.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wish you could,&quot; said Dermott. &quot;I'd sleep happier for the rest of the night. As it is, I don't intend to sleep at all. I've got a slight aversion to being murdered in bed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady nearly choked on his drink. &quot;And what the hell does that mean?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just that I think an attempt will soon be made to murder me. And Donald. And you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady looked as though he might explode, but remained speechless. Dermott addressed him with some acerbity.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Whenever you spoke down there in the foyer just now, you were tightening another screw in your own coffin lid.&quot; He turned to Willoughby. &quot;Could you spare a guard for Mr. Shore's house tonight?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course, but why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Simple. Mr. Brady unfortunately made it clear that he wanted copies of fingerprints found on the stolen truck. Brinckman and Jorgensen know that we've asked your people for what could be damning prints from your Edmonton H.Q. They'll discover, if they haven't already, that the copies of their own prints which we took earlier are in the safe in Mr. Shore's house.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What good would it do them to get the copies?&quot; Brady asked edgily. &quot;The originals are at police H.Q. in Edmonton.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How far d'you think this rot has spread?&quot; said Dermott. &quot;The originals may still be there, but they won't be much help once they've been through a shredding machine.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where's the problem?&quot; asked Willoughby. &quot;We just print 'em out again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;On what grounds? Suspicion? Just one mod-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Point out to them—which is the case—that it's a condition of employment at Sanmobil,&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So you'd have mass resignations on your hands. Then what?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby didn't answer. Mackenzie broke in, &quot;You said I was the other grave digger?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. You said the kidnappers must have been tipped off from Sanmobil as to when to expect Reynolds' bus. You were right, of course. But Brinckman and Jorgensen must have thought you meant it was they who gave the tip. They may even think we can trace the call to them, even though outgoing calls from the plant aren't normally tapped.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, I'm sorry.&quot; Mackenzie shifted uneasily.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Too bad. The damage has been done. And it wouldn't have helped to reproach you and Mr. Brady in public.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The phone rang. Dermott, the nearest, picked it up, listened briefly and said: &quot;One moment. I think the person you should talk to is Mr. Shore. He's right here with us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He handed the phone over and listened impassively to Shore's half of the conversation, which consisted almost entirely of muttered expletives. The phone rest settled as he replaced the receiver, so badly was his hand shaking. His face had gone white.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They've shot Grigson,&quot; he gasped.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who's Grigson?&quot; snapped Brady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sanmobil's president. That's all.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">Thirteen</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The police doctor, a young man named Saunders, straightened and looked down <I>at </I>the unconscious man on the pile of blankets. &quot;He'll be all right, eventually, but that's all I can do for him now. He needs the services of an orthopedic surgeon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How long will it be before I can question him?&quot; Brady asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;With the sedative I've given him, it'll be several hours before he comes around.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Couldn't that damned sedative have waited a little?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dr. Saunders looked at Brady with a marked lack of enthusiasm. &quot;I hope, for your sake, you never have your shoulder and upper arm shattered, the bone structure completely fragmented. Mr. Grigson was in agony. And even had he been conscious, I wouldn't have let you question him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady muttered something about medical dictators, then looked at Shore and said testily, &quot;What the hell was Grigson doing here anyway?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie said pacifically, &quot;When did he arrive?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yesterday afternoon. Flew in from Europe.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mackenzie nodded and looked around Reynolds' office. It wasn't a small room, but it was fairly crowded. Apart from himself, Brady, Shore, Dr. Saunders and the unconscious Grigson, there were Willoughby and two young men who had clearly been in the wars during the recent past. One had a bandaged forehead, the other an arm strapped from wrist to elbow. It was to this last person, Steve Daw-son, that Mackenzie addressed himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You were in charge of the night shift?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nominally. Tonight there <I>was </I>no night shift. The plant's closed down.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know. So how many of you were here tonight—yourself apart?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just six people.&quot; He glanced down at the wounded man. &quot;Mr. Grigson was asleep in his private room along the corridor there. Then.there was Hazlitt—supervisor of the night security shift—and four security guards deployed around the plant.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Tell us what happened.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well—I was patrolling, reinforcing the security team, as I had nothing else to do. I saw a light come on here in Mr. Reynolds' room. First I thought it must be Mr. Grigson—he's a very active, restless person, and an erratic sleeper. Then I got to wondering what he could be doing, because he'd already spent a couple of hours with Mr. Reynolds yesterday.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                     </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">215</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">So, quiet as I could, I came along the passage to Grigson's room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The door was closed, but not locked. I went in, and there he was asleep. I woke him, told him there were intruders in the plant, and asked to borrow a gun. I knew he had one, because he used to practice on a little private target range he'd set up here.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He'd have none of it. He produced his automatic, but kept it himself. He said he'd had it for years and knew how to use it. I couldn't argue with him—after all, I'm only twenty-eight, and he's crowding seventy.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Anyway, in here we found a man with the door of that safe open. He'd smashed Corinne's desk open with a fire ax to get at the keys. He was wearing a stocking mask and examining a bunch of keys he had in his hand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Grigson told him to turn around, real slow, and not to try anything, or he'd kill him. Then suddenly came two pistol shots, right close together, from behind, and Mr. Grigson pitched headlong to the floor. He was wearing a white shirt, and blood from his right shoulder and arm was pumping through it. I could see he was hurt real bad.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I dropped to my knees to help him. The man who'd fired the shots probably figured I was going for Mr. Grigson's gun. Anyway, he fired at me too.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dawson was breathing quickly, his distress evident. Brady poured him a scotch and handed the glass over. &quot;Take this.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dawson's smile was wan. &quot;I've never had a drink in my life, sir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Maybe you'll never have another,&quot; said Brady agreeably. &quot;But you need this one, and we need your story.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dawson drank, spluttered and coughed. He</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">screwed up his eyes and drank some more. He clearly detested the stuff, but his system didn't, for almost immediately some color began to return to his cheeks. He touched his bandaged forearm.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Looks worse than it is. The bullet just grazed me, wrist all the way to elbow, but very superficial. Stung, more than anything. One of the masked men forced me to help lug Mr. Grigson to the armory. On the way out I picked up two first-aid kits—they didn't object. They pushed us into the armory, locked the door and left.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then I took off Mr. Grigson's shirt and stanched the wound as best I could. It took a lot of bandages— there was so much blood coming. I thought he was going to bleed to death.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He could have,&quot; Saunders said with certainty. &quot;No question, your quick action saved his life.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Glad I was of some use.&quot; Dawson shuddered, looked at the doctor and went on, &quot;Then I bandaged my own arm and had a go at the door, but there was no way I could get it open. I looked around and found a box full of detonators, each with a fuse attached. I struck one and dropped it out through one of the ventilation grilles. It went off with quite a bang. I must have let seven or eight of them off before Haz-litt came hammering on the door and asked what the hell was going on. I told him, and he ran off to fetch a duplicate key.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dawson drank some more, spluttered, but less than before, and put his glass down. &quot;I guess that's about all.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And more than enough,&quot; said Brady with unaccustomed warmth. &quot;A splendid job, son.&quot; He looked around the assembled group, then asked sharply, &quot;Where's George?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Until then no one had noticed that Dermott was</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">missing. Then Mackenzie said, &quot;He slipped out with Carmody some time back. You want me to go find him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Leave him be,&quot; said Brady loftily. &quot;I have little doubt our faithful bloodhound is pursuing some spoor of his own.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In fact the bloodhound was pursuing a fancy, not a line. He had taken Carmody aside and whispered in his ear that he urgently wanted to question the girl, Corinne. Where was she?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In the isolation ward, like I said,&quot; Carmody replied. &quot;But I doubt you'll find it on your own. It's way out by itself, near Dragline One. Want me to come with you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure. That'd be real kind.&quot; Dermott swallowed his disappointment. He wanted to go alone. The instincts at work inside him made him feel uncomfortable. Nothing like this had happened to him in years. But he had better be realistic and accept the offer of guidance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By then the wind had increased, as it often did late in the night, and was whistling across the flat, open site with a deadly chill. The noise made it almost impossible to talk in the open—not that anyone in his senses would remain in the open for more than the minimum time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody had been reunited with his damaged Cherokee. Shouting an excuse into the wind, he got in first at the passenger door and slid across behind the wheel. Dermott heaved his massive frame in close behind him and slammed the door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody drove steadily across an apparently unmarked plain. The film of drifting snow had ob-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">scured the road, and the flat ground all looked the same.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How the hell do you know which way to go?&quot; Dermott asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Markers—there.&quot; Carmody pointed as a small stumpy, black-and-white post went past, with the number 323 stenciled on it in bold figures. &quot;We're on Highway Three. In a minute we'll turn onto Highway Nine.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Altogether they drove for nearly ten minutes before lights showed up out of the darkness ahead. Dermott was amazed once again at the sheer size of the site: by then they were four or five miles from the administration buildings.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The lights grew to a blaze of several windows, and they pulled up outside a single long hut. As they went through the door the heat hit them like a hammer, as did a smell of disinfectant. Dermott at once began to wrestle his way out of his outdoor clothes. He felt he would stifle if he kept them on for one more second.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They found Corinne propped up on a pile of pillows, looking white but (to Dermott's eye) very sweet in a pair of pea-green pajamas. Contrary to Carmody's predictions, she was wide awake. She'd been asleep, she said, and had woken up thinking it was already morning.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What time is it, anyway?&quot; she asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Four o'clock, near enough,&quot; Dermott answered. &quot;How d'you feel?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fantastic. Not even a bruise, as far as I can tell.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's wonderful. But my, were you lucky!&quot; Dermott began asking routine questions, to which he didn't really want the answers. He wished to hell Carmody would go away someplace and leave him</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">alone with the girl. What he would say to her if that happened, he didn't quite know. All the same it was what he wanted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You've given us a real good lead, you know,&quot; he said enthusiastically. &quot;Can't say just what it was, but it may be the breakthrough we need. Mr. Brady's delighted...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His voice tailed off as a heavy rumble suddenly shook the building. &quot;Jesus!&quot; He looked up sharply. &quot;What was that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody was gone already, out of the room and down the short passage. Dermott caught up with him at the outside door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Helicopter!&quot; Carmody snapped. &quot;Made a low pass right over the building. There he is, burning now.&quot; Way out in the blackness a red and a green light converged and then separated again as the aircraft swung around. As the two men stood watching, a pair of car headlamps snapped on from a point about a hundred yards in front of them. The vehicle moved forward, turned and stopped, with its headlights steady on a patch of snow.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a marker!&quot; Carmody cried. &quot;He's gonna land. Quick, get the girl out of here. They must have come for her.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How in hell do they know she's here?&quot; said Dermott.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't worry about that. Let's get her away.&quot; Moving like a sprinter, Carmody slipped back into the building, bundled Corinne up in a cocoon of blankets and carried her out to the Jeep, where he dumped her in the back seat. Dermott lumbered behind him, envying his speed, and hauled himself into the front.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Without putting on any lights Carmody started the engine and moved off into the inky night, heading out into the open behind the parked marker ve-</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">hide. A couple of hundred yards beyond it he swung around and faced in the same direction as the lights, so that he and Dermott could watch what happened through the windshield.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They sat there with the heater going full blast.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Warm enough?&quot; asked Carmody over his shoulder.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Plenty, thanks.&quot; Corinne sounded as though she was enjoying herself. &quot;I've got enough blankets to keep an elephant warm.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott wondered uneasily whether that was any sort of a joke at his expense, but his speculation was cut short by the arrival of the helicopter. Suddenly it was there, large and gray-white, riding down on a storm of snow into the headlight pool. The rotor flashed brilliantly in the silvery beams, and the snow flew outward from the downdraft.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's the one!&quot; said Carmody in a voice charged with excitement. &quot;The getaway chopper. Description tallies perfectly with Johnson's: gray-white, no markings, small fins by the tail. That's our baby. Damn!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As soon as the machine had landed, the car's headlights cut. The watchers sat blinded by the sudden darkness. They saw a flashlight bobbing about in the blackness, but nothing else.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Boy, will they be mad when they find you've gone!&quot; Carmody said happily.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;D'you think they're still in it?&quot; Corinne asked. &quot;The others, I mean?&quot; .</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could be—easily. Depends where the chopper's been these past few hours. Must have been waiting on the ground someplace.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Come on!&quot; snapped Dermott. &quot;Let's get out of here.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Carmody said easily. &quot;I</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Two figures moved swiftly past the lighted windows. More light showed as the door opened and shut.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can't we ram the helicopter or something?&quot; Corinne suggested. &quot;Stop it taking off?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Too big,&quot; said Carrnody immediately. &quot;You notice the legs and skis? Higher than our roof. All we'd do would be to damage the landing geer, which wouldn't stop them getting off. Besides, if I know them, there's a couple of guys with guns guarding the thing, at least. Hey—what was that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What?&quot; Dermott looked at him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I heard something. Machinery. Sure I did.&quot; Carmody looked out past Dermott into the darkness. &quot;Open your window a minute.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott obeyed, and instantly the noise was far louder: a huge squealing and clanking, as of some giant engine.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; Carmody shouted. &quot;The dragline. It's right here beside us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott opened his door and got out. His eyes, accustomed to the dark, could just make out the gigantic outline towering above them. Suddenly the noise seemed terrific. &quot;Good God!&quot; Dermott yelled into the wind. &quot;It's alive. It's <I>moving!&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Instinctively he began to run toward the machine, or rather, around it, for already he was alongside. Beside him he could hear the whine of electric motors, the squeal of metal and the crunch of frosted dirt as the mighty shoe ground forward. The coldness of the wind seared his lungs and made his eyes stream briefly before they froze. In spite of the discomfort, he felt fired by excitement and by rage, for here was a final and outrageous act of sabotage tak-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ing place right on top of him. In a flash of intuition he saw what they intended: to drive the monster machine over the edge of the pit which it had been excavating.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The facts and figures that had been flung at him came crowding into his head. Six and a half thousand tons. It could move at some 250 yards an hour. The pit was 150 feet deep. Although he was no engineer, he knew instinctively that if the monster went over the edge, it would never come out again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He came around the front of it and got another shock. The edge of the pit, showing as a limitless black hole, was less than thirty yards away. Perhaps only twenty-five. That meant he had a tenth of an hour—six minutes—to get the damn thing stopped. He looked up desperately. The boom disappeared into the night, like an Eiffel Tower tilted over. Somehow he had to get into, the cab and throw the right switches.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He ran back right under the thing, between the shoes. Somewhere there must be a ladder. At last he found it. But as he looked up toward the cab, far above him, he saw someone moving there in a faint glow of light. He hesitated, one foot on the steel ladder, wishing he had a gun and wondering whether he should go back for' Carmody. That was the last thought that entered his head for a couple of minutes, for the blow caught him squarely on the back of the neck, and brilliant points of light seemed to shoot outward through his head as he slumped to the ground.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He came around shaking from the cold and stuck in an awkward position. His hands were</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">jammed, somehow—jammed behind him. He needed to straighten his arms and get them back into action. He strained to sort himself out and realized with a shock that his wrists were manacled together, <I>and manacled to something.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He gave a grunt and heaved, whereupon a man spoke out of the dark behind him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, Mr. Dermott,&quot; said a voice he half-recognized but could not place. &quot;Struggling will not help. You are anchored to a steel ring let into concrete. The ring is directly in the patch of Dragline One, which, as you can see and hear, is now only a few feet from you. The controls have been preset and locked in position so that the middle of the right shoe will pass over you. Good-bye, Mr. Dermott. You have less than two minutes to live.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Fear cleared Dermott's head. &quot;Bastards!&quot; he roared. &quot;Sadistic bastards! Come back!&quot; But even as he shouted, he knew it was useless. In the whistle of the wind and the monstrous grinding of the dragline, his voice was nothing and carried nowhere. He twisted aroimd and discovered that he was tethered almost on the lip of the pit: the edge of the black abyss was no more than a yard away. In the opposite direction, the front of the dragline's shoe had ground remorselessly to within fifteen feet of him. The front of it was coming on like a tank. Above him, the steel tracery of the boom seemed to fill the sky with an angry black pattern.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott stopped shouting and began to fight the manacles. At least there was some movement. He could feel that a length of chain had been passed through the shackle on the ground. He jerked it furiously back and forth in the faint hope that the chain would break, but all he achieved was to chafe</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Carmody!&quot; he yelled desperately. &quot;Help!&quot; Where the hell had Carmody gone? Why didn't he come looking?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott fought the chain again and flopped flat, gasping. The shoe was only twelve feet off, scrunching on inch by inch. The whine of the electric motors seemed to fill the night, as if hell had claimed him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He threw his body feverishly to left and right, experimenting to see if he could get clear of the shoe's line of advance. Nothing he tried was the slightest good. The shoe was ten feet wide, and he was tethered right in the middle of its track. The monster had been set marching with hideous precision.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He lay still again, panting, beaten. Suddenly images began flashing through his mind, conjured up uninvoked by the extremity of his desperation. Once again he witnessed the final terrifying seconds of the car crash that had killed his wife, the time when an explosion had blown him clear off a rig in the Gulf of Mexico, into the shark-owned sea...</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">All at once he became aware of a light flashing over him. Then someone was crouching, pulling at his arms. Then he heard a high, feminine cry.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Corinne!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My God!&quot; she cried. &quot;What's happened? Oh, Jesus!&quot; She leaped to her feet and began to run. <I>&quot;Wait!&quot; </I>she screamed over her shoulder.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott saw her fall, get up again, and go like a greyhound, around the corner of the shoe, the flashlight swinging wildly in the blackness. He shouted something after her, but she was gone. <I>Wait, </I>she'd</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">said. Wait! What a hell of a thing to say! How could he wait? The shoe was scarcely ten feet from him: one minute, give or take a few seconds.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He found his eyes were full of tears, though whether they were of fear or relief or gratitude or what, he couldn't tell. He was crying like a baby.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Seconds were passing. He began to count. He got to ten and couldn't go on. He had been overtaken by a horrific vision of the exact physical process of destruction that was about to annihilate him. He would feed his feet and legs to the monster first. Or could he? Could he listen and watch while his ankles, shins and knees were crunched and flattened on the tundra? No—he would have to get the end over quickly and give it his head. But what would <I>that </I>be like, for God's sake? To hear his skull crack and feel that unthinkable weight! Impossible! Never!</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He roared again, &quot;CARMODY!&quot; As if by a miracle, his shout was answered. Headlights came boring up out of the night and swept him as the vehicle turned. Dermott stared incredulously as the lights came on at speed, heading right for him and the front of the shoe. At the last moment the vehicle slowed, but not enough to stop. The driver deliberately slid it into the front of the shoe, using it as a last-ditch barrier to stop the monster's progress. There was a sharp crash and the tinkle of falling glass. Then the door of the Jeep opened and Corinne leaped out.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was so little space left that Dermott had all but been run over. The Jeep's left-hand wheels were almost on him. The next thing he saw was the tires being forced bodily sideways toward him by the irresistible pressure of the dragline's advance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Corinne had the tail gate of the Jeep open. She dragged out a steel box—the emergency equipment—and dumped it behind Dermott with a crash.</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Keep still!&quot; she shouted above the noise. &quot;No— come back a bit. There. Keep there!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott leaned backward in the attitude she ordered, speechless with tension. He saw the wheels of the Jeep come sideways at him again. The back wheel was touching his feet already. The Jeep was being pushed like a toy. At that rate it was going to do more harm than good. It was merely acting as an extension of the shoe, and would crush him before the dragline itself reached him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He felt Corinne struggling behind him. Suddenly she gave a desperate cry. &quot;Oh my God! I can't do it. I'm not strong enough.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott's voice returned. &quot;What's happening?&quot; he shouted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The cutters!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;The bolt shears are biting into the chain, but I can't get enough pressure on them. It's too bloody hard!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Put one end on the ground,&quot; he ordered calmly. &quot;One handle on the ground. Then get your weight on the other.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He felt her try, but she slipped and went down with a crash. &quot;Try again!&quot; he yelled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By then the noise of the dragline was overwhelming: its roaring and grinding filled the night. But suddenly a new sound: a sharp crack told him that the great steel treads of the shoe had hooked into some part of the Jeep's bodywork. Instead of being pushed back, the vehicle had been gripped and held down. Dermott stared incredulously as the Cherokee began collapsing like an eggshell. The remaining headlight was snuffed out. Cracking, snapping noises accompanied the collapse of the hood and front wheels.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Behind him Corinne gave a despairing scream.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I just can't do it. I've got halfway through, but that's all.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Look for a hacksaw!&quot; Dermott shouted. &quot;In the emergency pack.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Got one!&quot; She began working again frantically.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For Dermott time seemed to have stopped. He saw that the Cherokee's engine block had at last offered the dragline a spot of serious resistance: only a spot, it was true, but a definite token. Ponderous as a dinosaur, the machine lifted one foot slowly into the air as it ground the little vehicle beneath its steel sole. As if in a trance, Dermott saw the windshield shatter, the front of the roof crumple down, the passenger compartment flatten. Right in front of him a back wheel snapped off and was squashed flat onto the ground. If his arms had been free, he could have reached out and touched the front of the shoe—it was that close.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">But his arms were <I>not </I>free.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't!&quot; Corinne screamed in desperation. -    Dennett's head cleared, and he shouted, &quot;Is there an ax?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A what?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;An ax.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes—here.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Smash the chain with that. Aim for the link you've been working on.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I might hit you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To hell with that. Belt it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He felt the thump as she let drive. The chain snatched sharply at his wrists and nearly jerked his arms from their sockets. Suddenly he smelled the stink of gasoline: the tank had been crushed.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Clank! She brought the ax down, then again. When Dermott twisted to see how she was doing, the</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">clawing thread of the shoe scraped down past his shoulder. The thing was touching him. He shrank away from the monstrous beast, and brought out his last, terrible idea.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Chop my hands off!&quot; he ordered, quite calmly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Go on. It's them or me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;NO!&quot; </I>She gave a piercing shriek and swung the ax down with every ounce of her behind it. Next second she was on her knees sobbing, &quot;Oh my God, it's gone! It's gone!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott fought his instinct to leap up. He held himself down as he struggled with the severed link. The tread was bumping and bruising him now. In another few moments it would hook him under, as it had the car.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;For Christ's sake!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Quick!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Miraculously, his hands came free. He got his arms back to their normal position and twisted sideways. &quot;Look out for the pit!&quot; he yelled. He himself was on the very lip. Hardly had he rolled clear of the dragline when there was a huge <I>whumph </I>and a roar of dark-red flame shot sideways at ground level. A chance spark had ignited the car's gasoline. By a fluke he had rolled into the wind, so that the fiery blast went the other way and left him unscathed. Corinne was there behind him, also intact.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The blaze made no difference to the monster's advance. The flames roared for a few seconds, then went out, and the dragline continued without faltering toward the brink.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott felt weak with reaction—but not as weak as the girl. One moment she was standing behind him; the next, as Dermott struggled to find the words to express his gratitude to her, she had collapsed in a heap on the ground. He picked her up as</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">tenderly as he knew how, laid her gingerly over his shoulder in a fireman's lift, and began carrying her toward the still-lighted windows of the isolation quarters. His eyes seemed to have gone blurred with the strain. Or was it just ice? He scrubbed them with his free hand and saw better. Out in the patch of white light ahead of him, the helicopter was preparing to take off, lights flashing, rotor spinning. Even as he watched, it lifted off and slanted away into the sky.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At once the car whose lights had provided the marker moved off and accelerated. Once again, Der-mott realized, the unspeakable murderers had melted into the night. He knew he ought to feel disappointed. As it was, he could concentrate on nothing except getting back into the warmth of the hut and lying down.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He was very close to the building, going slow, when he saw someone pass across the lighted windows in front of him. Fear seized him. Maybe it was one of them. Was he going to be shot after making such an effort? Before he had time to put down his burden or alter course, a flashlight came on, searched briefly and found his face.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good God! Dermott!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Carmody! Where in hell have you been?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Trying to ditch the chopper. What about you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Had a... had a bit of bother.&quot; Suddenly Dermott found he could hardly talk. He was about to break down. &quot;Take her, will you?&quot; he croaked. &quot;I've had it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">With an exclamation Carmody relieved him of his inert burden. &quot;Quick,&quot; said the policeman. &quot;Inside.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They had turned on the floodlights to illuminate the 150-foot depths of the pit below. They had also hammered in spikes ten yards back from the lip, and to these they had attached ropes so that the vertiginously inclined or the less-than-sure-footed could cling to them as they peered over the edge.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dragline One had ended up on its nose, tilted backward toward the near-vertical face at an angle of thirty degrees. The massive casing appeared undamaged, as did the triangular arm over which the control cables passed. Even the boom, its enormous length stretched out horizontally across the uneven valley floor, seemed undamaged, at least from above.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady had prudently wrapped his belaying rope three times around his mighty girth. &quot;Surprisingly little damage,&quot; he said. &quot;Or so it looks. I suppose some of the electric motors were wrenched free from their beds.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That'll be the least of our troubles.&quot; Jay Shore looked stricken, ashen-faced in the floodlights. The sight of the crippled monster had far more effect on him than on any of the others. &quot;It's getting the damn thing out of there.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wouldn't it be easier to get a replacement?&quot; asked Brady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jesus! Do you know what <I>a </I>replacement would cost at today's prices? Forty million dollars. Probably more. And you don't order one up, just like that. If we could have one on our doorstep tomorrow, I'm</FONT><BR>

Electric motors apart, the whole caboodle comes crated in tens of thousands of pieces, and it takes a team of skilled engineers months to assemble it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Cranes?&quot; Brady suggested. He seemed fascinated by the sheer size of the problem. Or he was trying to be diverted; trying not to think of his missing wife and daughter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shore made a dismissive gesture with his gloved hands. &quot;The biggest cranes in the world—a whole battery of them—couldn't lift the dragline an inch off the floor. We'll either have to dismantle it piece by piece and raise the bits up here for reassembly, or build a road from down there back up to surface level and have it towed up on bogies—or, perhaps, under its own steam. The road would have to be a very gentle gradient, which would mean a length of over a mile, heavily metalled on massive foundations. Whatever we do, it'll cost millions.&quot; He swore at some considerable length. &quot;And all this in just seven minutes' work!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why in hell couldn't you <I>stop </I>it, when we phoned you?&quot; asked Carmody.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The bastards knew what they were doing,&quot; said Shore savagely. &quot;They'd gone into the generator        &raquo;, room, thrown the breaker that fed power to Dragline       1 One, locked the door from the outside, left the key in the lock and smashed it so thoroughly that it'll need an oxyacetylene torch to open it again. We just couldn't get in to shut down the power.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They sure knew how to cause the maximum damage and disruption with the minimum of effort,&quot; said Brady. &quot;I suggest, Mr. Shore, there's no point in our remaining here a moment longer. All you're</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay. Let's go.&quot; Shore, who had supervised the construction of the dragline, working along with the contractors, Bucyrus-Erie, seemed strangely reluctant to leave the fallen giant. It was as if he were abandoning an old friend. Brady could appreciate how he felt. But he could also appreciate how he felt himself—he had become acutely conscious of the cold.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shore took one last look at the dragline and turned back toward the heated haven of the minibus. &quot;Okay,&quot; he repeated automatically. &quot;Let's go hear Dermott's story.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They drove the short distance back to the isolation block, where they found Dermott lying on a bed, already being questioned by Willoughby. Cor-inne was sitting on a chair in the corner of the small room, looking in better shape than the man she'd rescued.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How is he?&quot; Brady whispered to the nurse out in the corridor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;His wrists look pretty bad—they got chewed up by the manacles, and frostbitten as well. They're going to be real painful for the next few days. They'll mend, though.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What about his general condition—exposure?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What are you <I>talking </I>about? He's got the constitution of an ox.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the time Brady, Mackenzie and Carmody had filed into the room, the place was crammed full. Brady seemed much moved by the sight of his senior operative brought low, with hands and forearms heavily bandaged.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, George,&quot; he began, clearing his throat heavily, &quot;I am informed that you plan to survive.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure do.&quot; Dermott grinned up at them. &quot;But boy—I wouldn't want to go through <I>that </I>again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I got the story,&quot; Willoughby cut in, brisk and businesslike. He gave a quick precis of what had happened, including the arrival and departure of the helicopter. &quot;I'm sorry to say it, Mr. Shore, but it seems the plant is riddled with corruption. Number one, somebody sabotaged the generator room, so that you couldn't turn the power off. Number two, somebody else set the controls of the dragline to take it over the edge. Number three, somebody else hit Dermott and manacled him to the steel ring. Number four, somebody else again informed the kidnappers that the girl had survived her fall out of the helicopter and was back here in the isolation unit. That makes quite a lot of saboteurs for one plant.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Too right, it does,&quot; .Shore said bitterly. &quot;You don't think the chopper came back to do the dragline job—that somebody on board got out and set the controls?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Impossible. The dragline was moving before - the chopper landed. Isn't that right, Mr. Dermott?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Right. At least—no—not quite. But we .saw men from the chopper go straight to the building here—and then we heard the dragline moving, right near us. The guys from the helicopter didn't have time to reach the dragline and set up the controls.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What I'd like to know is whether your family, Mr. Brady, were still on board the helicopter,&quot; Willoughby said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, they were.&quot; Carmody startled them all with his sudden pronouncement. &quot;And Mr. Reynolds. He was with them.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How d'you know?&quot; Jim Brady asked. Dermott sat up abruptly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I <I>saw </I>them. That's what I was doing all the time you were involved with the dragline. I made a wide circle on.foot and approached the helicopter from the back. There was a man armed with a machine gun guarding the ladder, but I climbed up onto the skid-struts from the opposite side and got a look in through the cabin windows. They were all there— Mrs. Brady, Stella, Mr. Reynolds.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How...&quot; Brady faltered. &quot;How did they look?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fine—just fine. Quite calm, all of them. But they weren't quite as passive as they looked.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What d'you mean?&quot; Dermott asked quickly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One of them managed to drop this out of the door, or out of a window.&quot; From his breast pocket Carmody drew a brown leather billfold, which he handed to Brady. &quot;Looks like one of yours—J.A.B., nicely embossed in gold.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My God!&quot; Brady took it. &quot;That's Jean's. Her middle name's Anneliese. This was a birthday present. Anything in it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure is. Take a look.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">With his fingers trembling a little, Brady opened the billfold, unbuttoned a flap and drew out a small scrap of paper. <I>&quot;Crowfoot Lake Met. Station,&quot; </I>he read out loud. &quot;Well I'm damned.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott was elated. &quot;I knew it! I knew it!&quot; he kept saying. &quot;I knew the bastards would overreach themselves. Didn't I say they'd make a major mistake through over-confidence or desperation? Well, they've made it. Somebody couldn't resist the temptation to talk. Jean heard the name and wrote it down. Great, Jean!&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not so fast,&quot; Brady countered. &quot;For one thing we don't know where Crowfoot Lake is.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh yes we do,&quot; said Willoughby. &quot;It's up beyond the Birch Mountains, seventy, eighty miles north. I know it well.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How do we get there?&quot; Derrnott asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby looked at him reproachfully. &quot;Helicopter. No other way.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's four o'clock in the morning, gentlemen,&quot; Brady said heavily. &quot;An error to pursue further tonight. For one thing, we are all exhausted.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And for another we don't have a helicopter,&quot; said Dermott.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Precisely, George. I must say, your ordeal doesn't seem to have blunted your wits any.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you.&quot; Dermott lay back happily. &quot;Maybe Mr. Willoughby can help us in the morning—I mean, later this morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure, sure.&quot; Willoughby stood up. &quot;But everyone please be careful. We're up against professionals. Their performance has been pretty impressive to date. Nothing would please them better than to catch one of your gentlemen, Mr. Brady. Or you, for that matter.&quot; He turned to Corinne, only to find she had fallen asleep, sitting upright, in the corner. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said gently to Mackenzie. &quot;Look after her. But whatever you do, all keep together.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Like now,&quot; said Brady. &quot;We'll all get in that bus together and drive back to town. Mr. Carmody— it doesn't sound as though your vehicle's too serviceable. May I offer you a ride?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Flat as a pancake,&quot; said Carmody wryly. &quot;Never saw anything to match it. Thank you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They all piled in, with Shore driving. But before they even reached the administration block a radio message caught them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Shore—urgent.&quot; It was Steve Dawson, of the night shift. &quot;We got another emergency.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh <I>no!&quot; </I>Shore groaned. &quot;I'm coming. Be right there.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dawson met them and led them straight into <I>a </I>room off the main corridor which held six beds and was obviously a dormitory. On one of the beds lay the body of a fair-haired young man whose sightless eyes gazed at the ceiling.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh my God!&quot; said Shore.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who is it?&quot; Dermott snapped.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;David Crawford. The security man we were talking about.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The one we suspected?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's him. What happened?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Stabbed through the heart, from behind,&quot; said Dr. Saunders, who was standing by the bed. &quot;He's been dead some hours. We only just found him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How come?&quot; Dermott demanded. &quot;Isn't this the security men's dormitory?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One of two,&quot; said Saunders. &quot;The other's larger. Normally both are occupied by off-duty shifts. But since the shutdown, the men have been living at home. Nobody had any cause to come in here tonight.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ruthless bastards,&quot; said Brady, very low. &quot;Pour dead and two critically injured so far. Well, Mr. Willoughby. You've got a murder investigation on your hands.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">Fourteen</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At 11:30 that same morning Brady and his team were the sole occupants of the hotel's dining room. Outside, the wind had gone, the snow had been reduced to the occasional flurry, and the sun was making a valiant effort to shine through the drifting gray cloud. Inside, the mood was one of expectancy and suppressed excitement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One thing's for sure,&quot; said Brady firmly. &quot;You're not coming on this little jaunt.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh yes I am,&quot; Dermott countered. &quot;I most certainly am. You try leaving me behind.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What can you <I>do?&quot; </I>Brady was half-scornful, half-sympathetic. &quot;You can't use a gun, knock anybody down, tie anybody up.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;All the same, I've got to be there.&quot; Dermott was gray from lack of sleep and the pain in his savaged wrists. He could use his hands for gentle tasks, but his fingers were stiff, and to ease the discomfort he kept both elbows propped on the table with his forearms sticking straight up. &quot;I really need two slings,&quot; he muttered. &quot;One for each arm.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why not stay here and look after your gallant</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">savior?&quot; Mackenzie suggested slyly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">237</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">238</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott colored perceptibly and grunted: &quot;She's okay, I guess.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;She's being guarded, sure,&quot; Mackenzie agreed. &quot;But she might be even safer if she came with us. With the rot spreading as far as it has...&quot; He broke off and went back to eating as he saw Willoughby, the police chief, approaching across the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning, chief.&quot; Brady beamed at him. &quot;Get any sleep?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One hour.&quot; Willoughby tried to smile, but his heart wasn't in it. &quot;Call of duty. Can't complain.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;News,&quot; Brady announced abruptly. &quot;Take a seat.&quot; He handed a letter across the table. &quot;Communication from our friends. Mailed yesterday in the local post office.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby read the first paragraph without alteration of expression. Then he looked slowly around the watching faces and said matter-of-factly, &quot;One billion dollars.&quot; Suddenly his calm gave way. &quot;One billion dollars!&quot; he cried. &quot;Jesus!&quot; He qualified the word &quot;dollars&quot; several times. &quot;The sonsabitch.es are crazy. Who's going to pay attention to this kind of drivel?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You think it's drivel?&quot; Dermott asked. &quot;I don't. Probably a rather optimistic estimate of what the market will stand, but not very, I would think.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't believe it.&quot; Willoughby threw the letter down on the table. &quot;A billion dollars! Even if they mean it, how could the money be transferred without being traced to the recipient?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing simpler,&quot; said Mackenzie, forking a pancake. &quot;You could lose Fort Knox in the labyrinth of Eurodollars and offshore funds.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby glared at him over the breakfast cups. &quot;You'd actually pay this blackmailing monster?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">239</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not me,&quot; Mackenzie answered. &quot;I couldn't. But somebody sure enough will.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who'd be so crazy?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There's no craziness involved,&quot; said Dermott patiently. &quot;Just calculating, common business sense. The people who stand to lose most—our two governments, and the major oil companies who've invested in Alaska and Alberta. I don't know what the position is in Canada, but this is going to pose an intriguing problem in the States, because any governmental operation in tandem with the oil companies requires Congressional approval—and as every schoolkid knows, Congress would cheerfully immolate the oil companies. Looks like it'll make a highly diverting spectacle.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby looked baffled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Read some more,&quot; Brady prompted. &quot;The next paragraph is only a minor shock to the nervous system.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The policeman picked up the letter and started again. &quot;So they want you out of Alaska and Alberta—specifically, south of the forty-ninth parallel.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As predicted,&quot; said Brady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But no mention of any ransom?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Again, as we predicted.&quot; Brady sounded smug.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're not getting out, I take it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh no? I'm going to contact my pilot in a moment and have him file <I>a </I>flight plan for Los Angeles.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby stared at him. &quot;I thought you wanted to go to Crowfoot Lake?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We do. But we don't want to advertise our destination to any ill-natured persons who may be listening in. Therefore, we file a flight plan for L.A.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">240</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay, I get it.&quot; Willoughby grinned. &quot;What do you want <I>me </I>to do?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well...&quot; Brady became evasive. &quot;First, we need a guarantee from you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You can't make deals with the police.&quot; Wil-loughby's tone suddenly hardened.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Rubbish!&quot; said Brady comfortably. &quot;It's done all the time. Felons even make deals with judges in court.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay. So what do you want?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What we <I>don't </I>want is a company of paratroopers. Sure, they could mop this lot up with their hands tied behind their backs, but they might mop up a few wrong people too. Softly, softly on this one. Finesse. Stealth. Secrecy. Our way or not at all.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You making a point or something?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Tell me about Crowfoot Lake,&quot; said Brady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's an ideal place for this sort of thing. Tucked right away in the hills. Big, covered helicopter shelter right by the station. A chopper would never be spotted from the air. I was up there a year back, investigating a reported murder which turned out to be death by misadventure. Couple of young city boys newly arrived at the weather station. Happens at the beginning of the hunting season every year, without fail—all the Dan'l Boones and Buffalo Bills dropping like flies all over the place.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How big^s the lake?&quot; Dermott asked. &quot;Can a plane land on it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, you <I>can </I>land on it.&quot; Willoughby paused. &quot;But I don't think it would do you much good. See here, the lake's only two miles long, so wherever you came down on it, the people in the Met. Station would be bound to hear you. I've got a better idea.&quot; &quot;We need one.&quot; &quot;Now, Mr. Brady. I've got a request. I'm in a</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">241</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">delicate position. I am the law around these parts, and I'm supposed to know what's going on. I'm also a blackmailer. In return for guaranteeing that I can get you to the Met. Station undetected, I'd like some degree of participation in your expedition. You can't operate without police authority, and I'm the authority. All cards very close to the chest, okay. But I'd like an official watching brief—a presence.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know whose presence I'd like,&quot; Mackenzie said. Up till then he had been chewing steadily throughout the conversation, but a delicate patting of his big face with the napkin indicated that his meal was over. &quot;I'd like Carmody.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby said, &quot;That's not a bad idea. I'll get him right away.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He went off to telephone, came back and said, &quot;A couple of minutes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fine.&quot; Brady turned to Mackenzie. &quot;Don, tell Ferguson to go out to the airport and file a flight plan for Los Angeles: Tell him to expect people with provisions out there in just over an hour. Ask the kitchen to give us provisions for two or three days.&quot; &quot;Just food, Mr. Brady?&quot; Brady <I>loftily ignored the insinuation. &quot;Ferguson </I>is in charge of the commissariat. He'll know of any shortfalls. George, we'll need some hand compasses and, I guess, ammunition. Be generous with the ammunition.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby said, &quot;Hand compasses we have in abundance. What guns?&quot; &quot;Colt .38's.&quot; &quot;No problem.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Well, thank you. Tell me, Mr. Willoughby, you have a deputy chief?&quot; &quot;Indeed. And a good one.&quot; &quot;Good enough to be left in sole charge here?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">242</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure. Why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why don't you come with us? Giving us the directions is all very well, but it's not the same as having you on the spot.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't, Mr. Dermott. You tempt me. You tempt me sorely.&quot; From the momentary gleam of anticipation in his eyes, it was clear that he spoke the truth. &quot;Duty, alas, before pleasure. I have a murder investigation on my hands.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You've just reported zero progress. There are shortcuts, Mr. Willoughby. You wouldn't want us foreign amateurs to do the job for you, would you now?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm afraid I'm not quite at my best,&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You would be when we introduced you to Crawford's murderer. Where else would he be but at Crowfoot Lake?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr. Dermott, forget my last remark. I'm back at my very best. Ah, here he is.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody looked as large and formidable as ever.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;With Mr. Willoughby's consent, a request to make on behalf of Mr. Brady, Mr. Mackenzie and myself. As alien civilians we can only request. Those kidnappers—you're aware they are multiple killers, desperate men. They'll shoot on sight and shoot to kill.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody looked around in slight puzzlement but politely said nothing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott went on, &quot;Mrs. Brady, her daughter and Mr. Reynolds—we know where they're being held.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody, almost like a man in prayer, clasped his two hands lightly together and said, in a suitably churchlike whisper, &quot;Boy, oh boy. Let's go get them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">243</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Thank you. We appreciate it. One hour from now, okay?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby said, &quot;I'll just nip back to the office and put in a call to Edmonton.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Aha! I thought secrecy was the watchword?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It still is.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then may I ask?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You may not. A surprise. To be revealed at Crowfoot Lake. Or in the very close vicinity. You wouldn't rob me of my surprises?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the jet lifted off, Brady looked across the aisle to where Carmody had just withdrawn a peculiar metallic device from its chamois-lined leather casing. It appeared to consist of a small telescope attached to a curving, semicircular arm which in turn was bolted to a rectangular metal box. Brady said, &quot;What do you have there, Mr. Carmody?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;John, please Mr. Brady. Makes me feel less self-conscious. We cops are used to being called many things, but not 'Mister': This? This is an infrared telescopic night sight. These are the securing clamps. Fits on a rifle.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You can see in the dark with that?&quot; &quot;A little light helps. But total darkness is rare.&quot; &quot;You can see the enemy, but he can't see you?&quot; &quot;That's the idea behind it. Unsporting, and unfair. Never give the bastards a break—especially, Mr. Brady, if they're pointing guns at wives and daughters.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady turned to Willoughby who was in the window seat. &quot;And what lethal armaments are <I>you </I>carrying?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Apart from the regulation revolver? Just this</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">little number here.&quot; He reached down and picked up a zipped leather bag some eighteen inches by ten.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Funny shape for a gun,&quot; Brady said, intrigued.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two pieces that screw together.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It wouldn't be a submachine gun?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It would.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was a short silence and then Brady said, &quot;No chance you'd be carrying a few hand grenades on you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody gave a deprecating shrug. &quot;Only a few.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Infrared sights, submachine guns, grenades— aren't those illegal?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could be.&quot; Carmody sounded vague. &quot;I'm not sure they are at Crowfoot Lake. You'd have to ask Mr. Willoughby about that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The angle of climb had leveled off, and Brady nodded his thanks as Mackenzie brought a daiquiri to him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Cruising altitude, Donald? No way could we possibly have reached that yet.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Maybe this is high enough. You'd have to ask our police chief there.&quot; He nodded forward. Willoughby had gone up to the co-pilot's seat and was bent over a map with Ferguson. &quot;Doing his navigator's bit, I see.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Some five minutes more passed before Willoughby rose and headed back to sit by Brady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How long, Mr. Willoughby?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Seventy minutes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Seventy minutes! But I thought Crowfoot was only seventy miles away?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We filed a flight plan for Los Angeles, remember. Our first leg takes us through the radar control at Calgary. So, we're flying south. We're also flying low to lose the radar control at Fort McMurray. When</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">we do, we'll circle to the west and then north. After ten minutes, northeast. We'll keep low. No danger of bumping into anything; it's pretty flat all the way.&quot; He spread out a chart. &quot;Even the Birch Mountains here are really nothing of the sort. The highest peak is less than twenty-seven hundred feet. Really, it's just a low divide, a watershed. The streams on the west side flow west and northwest into the Peace and Birch rivers. The streams to the east flow east and southeast into the Athabasca River.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where's Crowfoot Lake?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Here, just on the west side of the divide.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It doesn't have a name printed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Too small. Neither does Deerhorn—here—on the east side of the divide. That's where we're going. It's a lake, too, but it's always called just Deerhorn.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How far from Deerhorn to Crowfoot?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Six miles. Maybe seven. Far enough, I hope. We go into Deerhorn low and we go into Deerhorn slow—as near stalling speed as possible. The chances of our being heard at that distance are remote. The only time we'll make any real noise is when we land. The only way a fast-landing jet like this can stop on a relatively short stretch of ice is to use reverse thrust on the engine. That makes quite a racket. But I'm pretty sure that the divide between the two lakes will act as a suitable baffle. I'm a little more concerned about the helicopter.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Helicopter?&quot; Brady said carefully.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. Left Edmonton about half an hour ago. Due in about an hour after us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You promised me—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And without radar transmission or airfield landing lights, how's he going to find his way here?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A signal from us by radio beacon. He's only to follow his nose. What worries me slightly is the noise the helicopter will make in landing. It's the biggest you've ever seen, and the racket is corresponding.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course.&quot; Brady showed his disquiet. &quot;Our friends at Crowfoot Lake have their own helicopter. Won't they hop in and come over to investigate?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I hope not. I want them,&quot; Willoughby said grimly, &quot;to stand trial, and they won't be able to if they're dead. If they come across, I'll have no option but to shoot them down.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Brady seemed unperturbed at the thought. Then he added, &quot;You can do that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We came here equipped with weapons for the express purpose of doing just that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah! I was asking Carmody about some of his equipment and he mentioned this infrared night sight. But I thought that was for shooting people.&quot; . &quot;It can do that, too. Did he mention the fact that he's also got a rifle that can switch from single-shot to automatic at the touch of a switch? The combination of that, the night-spot and a squirrel-hunter's eye, makes for a fairly lethal outcome. You know I have a submachine gun? Did I also mention that it has a special large capacity magazine—the old circular-drum type—and that every sixth shell is a tracer so that I can see how I'm doing?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby smiled, &quot;And of course we didn't mention my own modest contribution—the jumping jacks.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said dryly, &quot;You surprise me. Those weapons are illegal, of course—for police use. Right?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's the trouble with being in a remote northern town—you don't keep up as much as you might with all the notes, minutes and regulations that Edmonton issues every other day.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course not.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sometime later, Brady winced as the jet engines went into reverse thrust. Even though reason told him that the decibel level was no higher than normal, his apprehensive frame of mind made him feel he was listening to a continuous thunderclap of sound. When they had landed, he said to Willoughby, &quot;You could have heard that racket clear back in Fort McMurray.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wasn't all that bad.&quot; Willoughby seemed unconcerned. &quot;Well, stretch the legs, a little fresh air. Coming?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You look worried, boy. That was a perfect touchdown.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you. But I am, as you say, a little concerned. Aileron controls got a bit stiff as I came in to land. Nothing much, I daresay. Soon locate the trouble. First landing on ice, and maybe I was being a little oversensitive.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady followed Willoughby out and looked around. Deerhorn was a singularly bleak and unprepossessing place. Snow-dusted ice beneath their feet, flat, barren land, devoid of any form of vegetation, stretching away in featureless anonymity on three sides. To the northeast lay a range of low hills, sparsely covered with a scattering of stunted, snow-laden trees.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Those are the Birch Mountains?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The blast was powerful enough to knock both Brady and Willoughby, even at a distance of almost twenty yards, off their feet. For several seconds they lay where they had fallen, then made their way unsteadily toward the prone figure of Ferguson. Even as they reached him they were joined by Dermott, Mackenzie and Carmody, who had been inside the plane.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ferguson had fallen face down on the ice. Gently, they turned him over. His face and body appeared unmarked. It was difficult to tell whether or not he was breathing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Into the plane with him,&quot; Brady said. &quot;Warm blankets and heating pads from the Red Cross chest. His heart may have stopped. Anyone here know anything about heart massage?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We do,&quot; Carmody said. He picked up Ferguson and headed for the plane. &quot;First aid certificates.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Three minutes later, Carmody, still kneeling in the aisle, sank back on his heels and smiled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ticker's going like a watch,&quot; he said. &quot;Bloody fast watch, mind you, but it's going.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good work,&quot; Brady said. &quot;We leave him there?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Even when he regains consciousness—<SUB>:</SUB>no- reason why he shouldn't, there's no sign of any head injury—he's still going to be in shock. Heat pads we have in plenty. That's all we can give him, and probably all he requires. Can someone tell us what the hell happened? He came running up the aisle shouting, 'Stay where you are!' and clutching this damned thing in his hand. He was out through the door like a greyhound clearing his trap.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know what happened,&quot; Brady said. &quot;He complained that the controls were a bit stiff when he came in to land. That was because whoever placed</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">this charge did a sloppy job. The thing stayed in place while we were climbing or cruising at a steady altitude but slid forward and wedged itself against the ailerons when we started to descend. As we left the plane he told me he was going to look for the cause of the stiffness.&quot; Brady pursed his lips. &quot;He found it all right.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He was lucky,&quot; said Dermott. &quot;Had it been a metal-cased bomb, the casing would have turned into shrapnel when it exploded and the backlash would have caught him. Not a mark on him. So, a plastic bomb. For plastic bombs, plastic fuses—chemicals, really. You have two acids separated by some synthetic plastic barrier. One of them eats through the barrier, and when the two different acids meet they detonate. When an acid eats its way through the plastic barrier it generates considerable heat. I'm sure Ferguson not only felt this heat but knew right away what it meant.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady looked somber. &quot;If we weren't such a devious bunch, we'd have been flying at thirty-thousand feet on the way up. Our last trip, gentlemen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Right,&quot; said Dermott. &quot;Even flying low, like we did, we had the luck of the devil. The drawback of a chemical detonator is that it's almost impossible to get timing accuracy within ten or fifteen per cent. The timing could have gone off ten minutes earlier— and that would have been curtains for us. Our friends didn't want us out of this country—they wanted us out of this world. What better way to do it, neatly, cleanly and efficiently than have your plane's tail fall off six miles up?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Sikorsky Sky-Crane landed in darkness just after three-thirty in the afternoon. It was, as Willoughby had promised, the biggest helicopter they had ever seen. The engines cut, the huge rotors idled to a standstill, and there was left only the sound of a generator whining somewhere inside the massive hull. Telescopic steps snaked down from an opened door and two men climbed nimbly down to the ice and approached the waiting group.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Brown,&quot; the leading figure said. &quot;Lieutenant Brown, Air Force, alleged skipper of this craft. This is Lieutenant Vos, co-pilot, also alleged. Which of you gentlemen are Mr. Willoughby and Mr. Brady?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They shook hands and Brown turned to introduce a third person who had joined them. &quot;Doctor Kenmore.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How long can you stay?&quot; Willoughby asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As long as you wish.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Very kind. You have some cargo for me?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We have. Okay to unload now?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Please.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brown shouted instructions. Brady said: &quot;Two requests, Lieutenant?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have but to ask.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wish we had some more of this civility in the United States Air Force,&quot; Brady said. He addressed Dr. Kenmore. &quot;My pilot's been hurt. Would you look at him?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bernie was a bespectacled fellow seated by a huge RCA transceiver. Dermott introduced himself and said, &quot;Could you get me some numbers do you think?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No problem. We can patch in through a radio link via our Edmonton H.Q.&quot; Bernie's professional confidence was reassuring in the extreme. &quot;Numbers and names, sir?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have them here.&quot; Dermott handed over a notebook. &quot;I can actually speak to those people?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If they're home, sure.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I may be gone for a few hours. If I am, and you get through, will you ask them to hold themselves available or let me know where I can reach them?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sorry.&quot; Willoughby turned to Dermott. &quot;John Lowry, an expert on those machines. The Edmonton people sent him up to show us how to operate them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They're everything-mobiles,&quot; Lowry said. &quot;Snow, roads, rough terrain, marshes, sand—you name it.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We got three to put through extended tests— you know, the old test-to-destruction bit. Those are the three.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not quite standard models,&quot; Lowry went on. &quot;The front compartments are usually for stowage of gear. We've converted them into jump seats.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;You mean I can ride in one of those right now?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, <I>sotto voce </I>to Willoughby, &quot;Test to destruction is right.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lowry said, &quot;I should think so, sir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's great, just great.&quot; Brady's tone was hushed and reverent. The prospect of trudging a fourteen-mile return journey through Albertan snows had held singularly little appeal to him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Driving is simple,&quot; Lowry said. &quot;Changing the inclination of the traction belt changes the direction of travel. Done by the handlebars. You have forward and reverse gears and—a very sophisticated touch— hydraulic disc brakes. It can also do forty miles an hour.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Forty?&quot; Dermott said. &quot;It looks as if it would be hard pushed to touch five.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lowry smiled. &quot;Forty. Not on rough terrain, of course. Incidentally, these don't come cheap—four thousand dollars—but then the unique never does. I understand that you gentlemen are in a hurry. First three drivers up, please.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Please understand we don't mean to be churlish. We'll tell you when we come back. How's your expertise on shotgun wounds and bones shattered by high-velocity bullets?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not very extensive, I'm afraid.&quot; Kenmore's expression hadn't altered. &quot;You plan to remedy that before the night is out?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The six men left at four-thirty, exactly one hour after the Sikorsky had touched down. The helicopter's crew were there to see them go. Lieutenant Brown said, &quot;Air Force personnel are not as stupid as they look. We know where you're going, naturally.

Shortly before the little army reached this point, they had switched off their headlights.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The descent was simple but just as slow as the ascent because, in the absence of lights, the half-seen alders had to be negotiated with care. The engines, no more than idling, were gratifyingly quiet. Willoughby called softly and the three Finncats came to a halt,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Far enough,&quot; he said. &quot;We can't be more than three hundred yards from the shore.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay.&quot; Dermott agreed. &quot;How many crew at the Met. Station, Willoughby?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just two. I shouldn't imagine that any harm has come to them. They have to keep sending their regular radio reports. Any breakdown in those would have brought an official helicopter out here very quickly. So the reports must have continued to go out—under duress.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We go now,&quot; Brady said, &quot;And we don't treat them like human beings. No warnings. No fair play. No sportsmanship. Shoot first, questions afterward. People who plant time bombs in aircraft—or steal my Jean and Stella—aren't full of finer feelings or the rules of civilized warfare.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby said, &quot;Fair enough. But shoot to cripple, not to kill. I want those men to stand trial.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Of course, the conduct and termination of the trial would be greatly speeded if we had their confessions in advance.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And how do you figure on getting those?&quot; Dermott asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Simple, George. It all depends upon how intrepid you're feeling this afternoon.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wicked wind hissed through the clump of alders some twenty yards behind the meteorological station. The trees offered little in the way of cover, but it was the best and closest that the men could find. Luckily, the night was moonless: the buildings showed as black lumps in the snowy landscape.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bulky as bears in their Arctic gear, the raiders silently watched another figure, flattened to the snow, inch his way up toward them, propelled only by elbows and toes. Arrived in the shelter of the trees, John Carmody rose to a kneeling position.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They're there,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Reynolds and the ladies. The ladies are handcuffed together, but they seem all right. Don't look as though they've been maltreated. There are five other men in there, smoking and drinking, but not drinking too much. A little room leads off the big one. Could be there's someone asleep in there, but I don't think so. The door's ajar and the light's on. Any person who wanted to sleep would have switched the light off.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well done, boy,&quot; said Brady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Three other things, sir. At least three of the</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">in his hand. The whole group is sitting around the table listening to a radio. They're listening pretty hard, too—trying to catch something. That made me think there wouldn't be another of them in the small room—he'd have been out there listening too.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could be the two station operators are in there,&quot; said Dermott. &quot;Tied up, I mean.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I thought that too,&quot; said Carmody.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know what they're listening for,&quot; Brady whispered. &quot;News of a certain jet having crashed in Alberta ^this afternoon. What was the third thing you saw?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;All five men are wearing stocking masks.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott said, &quot;Which they wouldn't bother with if they intended to dispose of the hostages.&quot; His husky murmur dropped to a whisper. &quot;Keep low. Keep quiet.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A rectangle of light had appeared at the side of the cabin. A figure walked through the opened doorway and headed toward the smaller building. Moments later lights came on there.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One of them,&quot; Brady said. &quot;Hardly likely to let one of the operators stroll across there and send off an S.O.S. Perfect. Come, George, this is where you earn your congressional medal of honor or whatever.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady moved out, traveling quickly and silently, no trace of the comfort-loving fat man left. Arriving at the main cabin door, Brady looked over his shoulder to check the smaller cabin. The light was still on, the door still closed. Brady turned back to the cabin door, gripped the handle, opened the door and walked inside, .38 in hand, closely followed by Dermott and Mackenzie, with their guns leveled. Brady advanced on the four stocking-masked men sitting around the table. Several started up.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Keep your hands on that table,&quot; he said, &quot;if you're not entirely mad. We're just looking for an excuse to shoot you through the head. One of you turn that radio off—the good news you're waiting for has just arrived.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jim! Jim!&quot; Jean Brady was on her feet. &quot;You've come!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course.&quot; Brady's voice held a curious mixture of irritation and smug self-satisfaction. &quot;You thought I wouldn't? Brady Enterprises always delivers.&quot; As his wife made to approach him, he raised his left hand. &quot;Just a minute. Don't come too close. These are desperate men. Mr. Reynolds, Stella. Sorry we took so long about this but—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dad!&quot; Stella was on her 'feet, a desperate urgency in her voice. &quot;Dad, a man—&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Drop your guns.&quot; The deep voice came from the doorway. &quot;Don't turn around or you're dead.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do what the man says.&quot; Brady set the example. Within a second the other two guns had clattered to the floor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Stay where you are,&quot; the same voice ordered. &quot;Billy.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Billy didn't have to be told what to do. His search was quick but thorough. He stepped back and said, &quot;Clean, boss.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So.&quot; The door closed and a burly man appeared before them. Like the others, he was masked. &quot;Sit on that bench there.&quot; He waited until they had done so, seated himself by the table and said, &quot;Watch them.&quot; Three of his men produced pistols and covered the three seated men. He put away his gun.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The 'ladies, I must say, seem very disappointed. They shouldn't, really.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't take all the credit. One of my men did.&quot; He lit a cigarette and stuck it through a hole in the stocking mask which had been cut out for that purpose. &quot;So now I have Mr. Jim Brady and his two invaluable associates. A full hand, one might say.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Designed to blow our tail off at thirty thousand feet?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;We're </I>alive. But one man's probably dying, and two are seriously injured. God, man, what are you— a psychopathic killer?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not psychopathic. Just a businessman. How come <I>you </I>didn't die?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because we landed before the bomb went off.&quot; Brady sounded very tired. &quot;We got a report from a forest ranger saying that an off-white helicopter had been seen in these parts. Nobody paid attention except us—we knew you had a white helicopter.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How did you know that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A lot of people saw it around the plant at Athabasca.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can vouch for that. He was interrupted.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The package moved forward and jammed the controls—the tail ailerons. The pilot had to land— it was on the way down that we caught a glimpse of your helicopter. We crash-landed on another lake. Pilot told us to get out. He tried to remove the charge,</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We know that, too.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So they were expendable. You had no compunction about murdering them, too?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Compunction is not a word in my vocabulary. Why did you come here?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And, of course, it was you who blew up the plant and destroyed the dragline. A pity you had to kill and wound so many in the process.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Look friend, we don't play kiddies' games. Too bad if someone gets in our way. This is a man's world, and we play for keeps.&quot;</FONT><BR>

Do you know what is my one ambition in life right now?&quot; The man, apparently, did. Carmody pocketed the gun and turned to the remaining and unwounded member of the quintet, who had his gun on the table before Carmody could even speak to him.</FONT><BR>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Nobody spoke.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You.&quot; He indicated the person who had so hastily placed his gun on the table. &quot;Towels, cotton wool, bandages. Nobody's going to mind very much if your three friends bleed to death, but personally I would sooner see them die legally. After they've been tried, of course. Let's see your faces.&quot; He walked around ripping off masks. The first three /aces apparently meant nothing to him. The fourth, belonging to the man he'd just appointed to first aid duty, clearly did.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby stroked his chin. &quot;A moot point, Mr. Brady.&quot; He had no idea what Brady was talking about, but had learned to listen when he suggested something.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;You really are extraordinarily nai've, Napier. I told you that Mr. Willoughby and his officer were severely injured when our plane crash-landed, yet you seemed hardly surprised to see them here. Perhaps you're just stupid. Perhaps events have moved too fast for your limited intellect. Our plane, of course, did not crash-land. No forest ranger pilot spotted you. We never saw your helicopter on the way to our alleged crash-landing.</FONT><BR>

Doubtless inspired by the thought of the enormous fees he would extort, he was positively Maecenas-like in his hospitality. Reynolds had been joined by his wife. The atmosphere was festive, but Dermott and Mackenzie didn't seem very jovial. Dermott approached the beaming Brady—he wasn't beaming at anything in particular but was just sitting there, wife's hand in his left, daiquiri in his right—and said, &quot;Donald and I would like to slip away for a bit, sir. Do you mind?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course not. Do you need me?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Minor matters, only.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Go right ahead, George.&quot; The beam, which had faded slightly, lit up again. Brady would now have the field to himself, and it was possible that his retailing of recent events might vary slightly from the one he would have given if his two lieutenants had been present. He glanced at his watch. &quot;Eight-thirty. Half an hour or so?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;About that.&quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                          </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">*&quot;&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">On their way out they stopped by Willoughby's chair. Dermott smiled at a rather misty-eyed Mrs. Reynolds, then said to Willoughby, &quot;Brinckman and Jorgensen?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><SUP>1</SUP> Dermott and Mackenzie spent not half an hour but an hour and a half in Dermott's room, talking, planning, and mostly, telephoning. When they returned to the lounge Brady greeted them effusively. He was totally unaware of how much time had elapsed. The number of the company had increased. Dermott and Mackenzie were introduced to a couple who turned out to be the mayor and his wife. Jay Shore had returned from the plant and they were introduced to <I>his </I>wife, too. They were introduced to a charming lady who turned out to be Mrs. Wil-loughby. After that they were introduced to two other couples whose names they failed to catch. Jim Brady was spreading his wings that night.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby came up and spoke to them quietly. &quot;Another item, although it's just another unnecessary nail in the coffin. We retrieved the prints from Shore's house and compared them to the ones in the kidnap truck. Two matching sets were found—Napier and Lucky Lorrigan's.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At eleven o'clock, Dermott and Mackenzie approached Brady again. He was still in sparkling form: his tolerance for rum passed mortal understanding. Dermott said, &quot;Mr. Brady. We're bushed. We're off.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wearily they looked. No question, Brady had the right of it. They were enjoying themselves, not least young Carmody, who had discreetly withdrawn from the main body of the group to sit in a corner with Stella. -</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We wish you luck. You want us to collapse dramatically in front of all your guests?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's the trouble with you young people of today. No get-up-and-go.&quot; When the occasion arose Brady could conveniently forget that his associates and himself were of the same generation. &quot;No stamina.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We'd like to talk to you in the morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott went and kissed Jean good night, Mackenzie did the same. They made the rounds with punctilious good nights and left.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott awoke at seven-thirty. By eight, he was showered, shaved, eating off his breakfast tray and busy on the telephone. At nine he was joined by Mackenzie. At ten they were both closeted with Willoughby. At noon, they joined Brady at his breakfast table and explained what they had in mind. Brady chewed through the last of his ham omelette, which had originally been the size of a soup plate, then shook his head in a decisive fashion.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's out of the question. It's all over. Okay, there are a few stray threads in Alaska, but who am I to devote my time to that sort of small potatoes?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So it is in order if Donald and I resign?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Fortunately for Brady he was neither eating nor drinking at the moment, so he had nothing to choke over. &quot;Resign? What the hell do you mean?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's Donald's fault, really. Half Scots, you know. He hates to see good money being thrown away.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Money being thrown away?&quot; Momentarily, Brady looked almost appalled, but his recovery was swift. &quot;What's this nonsense?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How much are you charging Sanmobil for our services?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, I'm not one to prey on the misfortunes of others. A half million I guess. Plus expenses, of course.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In that case, I reckon Donald and I would rate a quarter of a million for picking up stray threads and small potatoes.&quot; Brady was silent, his eyes fixed on something beyond infinity. &quot;With your name,&quot; Dermott persisted, &quot;one can see no reason why the Prudhoe Bay oil companies shouldn't also come up with a half million. Plus, of course, expenses.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">Sixteen</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The meeting was held that evening in the Sanmobil canteen, which was drably lit and decorated in dingy cream and pea-green. Nevertheless, the room had much to recommend it for such a gathering, not least the fact that it was large and warm and a place from which the public could easily be excluded.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The tables and chairs had been rearranged so that the men conducting the proceedings sat in a line—on stage, as it were—facing down the long room. The rest of the seats had been set out in two blocks, divided by a gangway.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In the middle of the top table sat Willoughby, acting as host in his own parish. On his right was Hamish Black, general manager of BP/Sohio, Alaska, who had flown down from Prudhoe Bay to be present. On Willoughby's left sat Brady, overflowing a rickety wooden chair, and beside him were his two trusty henchmen.</FONT><BR>
</P>

At the back of the room were nearly thirty other men from Sanmobil brought in so that they could hear the full report of what had been happening. Finally, in an unobtrusive position at one side, John Carmody and a couple of fellow policemen occupied a flat bench, with their backs against the wall; and sandwiched between them was Corinne Delorme, looking small and wan and rather scared.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby stood up to open the proceedings.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. As the senior representative of the law here in Alberta, and as your nominal host, I would like to thank all you people who've been good enough to come from places as far afield as Prudhoe Bay, Anchorage and even New York.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A murmur went around the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's right,&quot; Willoughby confirmed. &quot;Two gentlemen at least have come all the way from New York. Now, the purpose of this meeting is to explain to the senior employees of Sanmobil and BP/Sohio just what's been going on these past few days, and, if possible, to clear up the few final questions to which we don't yet have the answers. I call on Mr. Hamish Black, general manager of BP/Sohio, Alaska, to put &quot;you in the picture.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Black rose to his feet, all disapproval and severity. Yet when he began to speak, he seemed to acquire a stature and authority that thoroughly surprised Brady and his associates.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">- &quot;I hardly need tell you,&quot; he began, &quot;that both the Alaskan pipeline and the Sanmobil tar-sands complex here at Athabasca have recently been subjected to deadly and intensive industrial sabotage.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">275</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The action effectively closed down the flow of oil from both centers, and in the process of the sabotage at least four innocent people have been murdered, while several others have been gravely injured.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We devoutly hope that the savage and brutal attacks are at an end. They certainly seem to be so in Alberta—and for this the sole credit goes to the investigation team of Brady Enterprises, headed by Mr. Jim Brady himself and his two senior assistants, Mr. Dermott and Mr. Mackenzie.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">With the ghost of a smile softening the line of his pencil moustache, Black indicated the Brady team. To his dismay, Brady found himself blushing for the first time in years. He ground his teeth and contrived to look sideways at Dermott without moving his head. The guy they'd treated like dirt was praising them!</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Black went on, &quot;no such happy conclusion has been reached in Alaska. Up there, we have no positive guarantee that the sabotage is at an end, for the simple reason that the individuals responsible for the criminal activity have not yet been brought to justice.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Brady Enterprises have been as deeply involved in making inquiries in Alaska as they have here, and since they are the only people with an overall view of the present position, I should like to call upon Mr. Brady himself to give us <I>a </I>report.&quot; •</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady heaved himself upright and cleared his throat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, Mr. Black. Ladies and gentlemen, I promise to be as brief as possible, and to waste none of your time. First I will ask for a word from Mr. John Young, who is director of City Services, a Federally backed investigative agency in New York. One of its functions is to oversee and regulate the</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">conduct of private detective and investigative agencies in the state of New York. Mr. Young?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In the front row of the Sanmobil team seats, a lean, bald-headed man with thick-rimmed glasses rose to his feet. He looked at the papers in his hand, smiled at Brady, and turning to face the body of the hall, he began.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;City Services was asked by Brady Enterprises—this was with governmental consent—to investigate the background of a private security agency owned and run by one Samuel Bronowski, who later became head of security on the Alaskan pipeline,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Apart from the fact that an unusually large percentage of valuables entrusted to the firm's safekeeping had been missing—for readily explainable reasons—we found no evidence of any outright misconduct. But I was further asked to find out the names and identities of any of Bronowski's associates who left the firm at about the same time as he did—that is to say, within six months either side of his departure date. We came up with ten names— not a particularly high wastage rate in such an agency—but Brady Enterprises were particularly interested in four of them.&quot; Here Young consulted the notes in his right hand. &quot;Their names are Houston, Brinckman, Jorgensen and Napier.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Young sat down and Brady rose again to thank him. &quot;Well,&quot; he continued, &quot;for those of you who do not already know, three of the four just mentioned are already in jail, charged with various crimes from murder downward. The other man, and Bronowski, you can now see for yourselves.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He made a small sign to Willoughby, who nodded to one of his uniformed men at the door. Next moment the door opened, to admit Bronowski and Houston, manacled together. They were hustled to</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">seats in the front row of the Alaska-side stalls. Bron-owski still sported his impressive head bandage, and beneath it, his broad, strong face was sullen.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So.&quot; Brady purred. &quot;I promised we would not waste time. We have established that at least two security agents from the pipeline and three from Sanmobil were old acquaintances, that they were acting in concert, organized widespread sabotage, exchanged codes and were responsible for murder. We have also established that Bronowski was the undisputed leader. These facts have been put on record by many witnesses, who will testify in court. But let us move on, I would like to call on Dr. Parker.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, well.&quot; Parker paused reflectively. &quot;I act in a forensic capacity for the police at Anchorage. Mr. Dermott brought down three corpses from Prud-hoe Bay. I examined one of them—an engineer who had been murdered in Pump Station Number Four. He had sustained a most unusual injury to his right index finger. I understand that Dr. Blake here attributed this to the force of the explosion which destroyed the pump station. I have to disagree. The finger was deliberately broken—there is no other way it could have happened. Mr. Dermott?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott stood up. &quot;Mr. Mackenzie and I have a theory. It's our belief that this dead engineer was carrying a pistol when he was held up by the people who had planted the explosives. We further believe that he recognized his assailants, and they, knowing this, killed him before he could use his gun in self-defense. We also believe that his dead finger locked over the trigger grip. That would be possible, doctor?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Indeed—quite possible.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We surmise the criminals had to break the</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alistair MacLean</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">man's forefinger to get the gun away. A dead man found with a gun in his hand would have raised serious doubts as to whether the explosion had been a genuine accident.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Further, papers seen in his coat pocket were later missing. Neither my colleagues nor I know what those papers were. We can only assume that he had accumulated incriminating evidence against someone—which would account for the fact that he was carrying a gun.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott paused. Then he said, &quot;I would like to ask Mr. Brady to discuss the vital question of who is ultimately responsible for this spate of crime.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady hoisted himself upright again. &quot;Mr. Car-mody—would you be so kind as to stand by Bron-owski? I am aware that he is handcuffed, but I'm also convinced he's a man of violence. Dr. Parker?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dr. Parker rose leisurely and walked across to Bronowski. Carmody was already there. The doctor said to him, &quot;Get behind him and hold his arms.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Carmody did so. Bronowski yelped with pain as Parker reached forward and ripped away the bandage that covered his forehead and temple. The doctor peered closely at the temple, touched it, then straightened.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This is a delicate area of the head,&quot; he said. &quot;A blow such as he is alleged to have received would have left a bruise for at least a fortnight. Probably longer. As you can see, there is no such bruise, no sign of any contusion. In other words,&quot; he said, pausing for effect, &quot;he was never struck.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Things look rather black for you, Dr. Blake.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They're going to look a damn sight blacker,&quot; Parker said. He had resumed his place. &quot;Mr. Dermott, in Anchorage, made what I then regarded as</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">ATHABASCA</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                       </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">279</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">an extremely strange request. I no longer regard it as such. Despite the fact that you, Dr. Blake, had carried out an autopsy on John Finlayson, Mr. Der-mott asked me to carry out another. Unheard of, but, as it turns out, justified.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your certificate said that Finlayson had been struck on the occiput with some form of loaded salt bag. As in the case of Bronowski, there was no sign of any contusion. The skin had been somewhat abraded, which could have occurred before or after death. What is important is that one of my younger associates discovered traces of ethyl oxide in the blood. It is difficult to conceal such trace elements. On closer examination, we discovered a tiny blue puncture just under the rib cage. Further investigation proved beyond any doubt that a needle or probe had been inserted through this puncture and pierced the heart. Death would have been pretty well instantaneous. In other words, Finlayson had been anesthetized, then murdered. I do not think there is one medical authority in either of our countries who would dispute my findings.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Comment, Dr. Blake?&quot;,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He appeared to have none.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The FBI's Morrison said, &quot;I have. He's not a doctor. He was trained in an English university and flung out in his fourth year for reasons as yet undisclosed but which I'm sure we can readily ascertain. No doubt he learned enough in that time to use a needle or probe.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Comment, Blake?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Again he had none.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I do not know, but I'm pretty sure that this is what happened,&quot; Dermott said. &quot;Finlayson came across Bronowski and Houston tampering with the fingerprint card index. I suggest that Bronowski was</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">removing his own prints from the file. I suggest he was substituting some other prints for his own. Whose, I do not know, but that again we can ascertain. The next suggestion is straightforward and obvious. The prints on an Anchorage telephone booth were Bronowski's. We have only to take his prints to confirm.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady said, &quot;Comment, Bronowski?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Silence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well.&quot; Brady looked around the room. &quot;Guilty as hell. That almost wraps it up.&quot; He stood up, as if to end the meeting. &quot;But not quite. None of the accused has the intelligence or knowledge to mastermind an operation of this nature. This required a highly specialized degree of knowledge. Someone who had the inside track.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby asked, &quot;We have an idea of this person's identity?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know who he is. But I think I'll let Mr. Morrison and the FBI take over here. My colleagues and I had our suspicions as to the identity of the mastermind behind the killings and sabotage both here and in Alaska, but it was Mr. Morrison who got the proof.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I got the proof,&quot; Morrison said, &quot;but that was only because my nose was pointed in the right direction. Bronowski claimed to have owned—and maintains he still owns—an investigative agency in New York. This is untrue. As Mr. Young discovered in the course of his investigations, Bronowski only acted in the capacity of a front man, a figurehead. The real source of power, the owner, was someone else. Right, Bronowski?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bronowski scowled, clamped his lips and kept his counsel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No matter. At least you don't deny it. Mr.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Young, accompanied by New York detectives and armed with a search warrant, examined the firm's private correspondence. The firm had been so nai've as to file away, instead of destroying, fatally damaging and incriminating evidence. This evidence not only revealed the identity of the true owner, it also revealed the astonishing fact that this same individual owned no fewer than four other protection or investigative agencies in the city of New York.&quot; Morrison glanced to one side. &quot;Mr. Willoughby?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Willoughby nodded and looked aside. Carmody nodded, rose and walked leisurely to the back of the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This owner,&quot; Morrison went on, &quot;was an absentee landlord, but only during the past couple of years. Before that he was on the New York stock exchange and an investment counselor on Wall Street. He wasn't too successful. Not really a financial man at all, though he liked money. More like a bull in a china shop. Too extroverted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The landlord's most recent absence was caused by the fact that he had become busy elsewhere. He was busy in Athabasca, at an inconvenient distance from Wall Street. He was, in fact, working for San-mobil. He was busy being Sanmobil's operations manager,&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't move. Keep quite still.&quot; Carmody leaned over Reynolds' shoulder and relieved him of a silenced automatic which he had begun to slide out of a shoulder holster. &quot;You could cause yourself an injury. What's a law-abiding citizen like you doing carrying a gun?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Gasps of surprise broke out all around the room. Almost everybody stood up to get a better view. Reynolds' face, normally so rubicund, had gone gray, making an unpleasant clash with his corn-colored</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">hair. He sat as if paralyzed while Carmody slipped manacles on him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This is in no way a trial,&quot; Brady announced. &quot;So I do not propose to question him. Nor will I adumbrate the factors that made him turn the way he did—save to say that his main grievance appears to have been that he had been passed over for promotion. He found his way ahead blocked. He conceived the idea that outsiders were always brought into the firm to occupy senior positions. You may think his reaction a little excessive.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady stopped. He had, at this point, intended to have a dig at Black, by mentioning the oil companies' practice of installing accountants in senior management positions. As things had turned out, however, he decided against it, and merely asked Black to sum up.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This Black did, in a surprisingly warm and human manner. Again he praised Brady Enterprises effusively, and he ended by reassuring everyone present that the campaign of terror and destruction was over. The meeting was closed. Police officers escorted Reynolds, Blake, Bronowski and Houston away to the cells, and everyone else began to disperse.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brady, feeling unwontedly nervous, sidled up to Black.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My apologies,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Must offer you my sincere apologies. My associates were infernally rude to you that time...no cause for it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My dear fellow—not at all,&quot; said Black magnanimously. &quot;I daresay it was my fault anyway. I hardly realized what deep trouble we were in. I thought your investigations were superfluous. Now I know different.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'd like to apologize, too,&quot; muttered Dermott,</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">stiff with embarrassment. &quot;Trouble was—if I may say so—you seemed so unco-operative.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It was the <I>cost </I>that frightened me. Don't forget, I'm an accountant by training.&quot; To the amazement of the Brady team, Black actually laughed. They laughed too, from sheer release of tension— and the next second, Black caught them neatly on the rebound.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well now, Mr. Brady,&quot; he said briskly, &quot;as to the question of your fee...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh... now!&quot; Brady spluttered, caught right off-balance. &quot;I assumed all along I would negotiate that with your London office.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No need, I'm glad to say.&quot; Black was all breezy sunshine. &quot;London has empowered me to deal directly with you. Our chairman felt that despite your close friendship, or perhaps because of it—I should settle this.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's...well...NO! I mean, I...I never discuss fees myself.&quot; Brady sounded lame, and knew it. But he pulled himself together fast, &quot;I have to consult <I>my </I>accountant, even if you don't.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Forty love, and Black to serve,&quot; muttered Der-mott as they moved away. He was about to go for his coat when, down one side of the room, he spotted Corinne Delorme still sitting on a bench, as if in a trance. He went along to her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Come on, honey,&quot; he said gently. &quot;Time to go.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I just can't believe it,&quot; she said. &quot;It's not possible.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well—it happened. Are you upset?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not really—no. I didn't care that much about him. It's just that I kind of got used to believing what he said.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know, one does. But you saw how devious he was. Anyone who had himself kidnapped to add ver-</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">isimilitude to the proceedings—anyone who does that is hardly straightforward.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I guess that's right. All those murders, too. Oh God, it's awful.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It <I>was </I>awful. But it's over. Coming?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I suppose so.&quot; She stood up, and Dermott helped her into her coat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You and I were the two luckiest people in the whole damn business,&quot; he said. &quot;We both ought to be dead. Without you I would be.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Suddenly her blank eyes lit up and she smiled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dermott smiled back. &quot;What are you going to do now you've got no boss to work for?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't know. Find another job, I suppose.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not many good jobs in Fort McMurray. Why not come south and work for me?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;For <I>you?&quot; </I>Her eyes widened. &quot;I haven't thought of that.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Think of it now. Shall we go?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'd offer you my arm, if it wasn't still so damned sore.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And I might even take it.&quot; She looked upward and snuggled close against him as they went out through the door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The sight seemed to occasion the most immense merriment in Brady and his one remaining associate. They both rolled in their seats like clowns, giving vent to noisy explosions.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Stay me with flagons, Donald,&quot; cried Brady, as he recovered. &quot;I am seriously in need of liquids. I was beginning to think we had a romance on our hands.&quot;</FONT><BR>
