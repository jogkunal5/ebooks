<p class="synopsis">JOHN KENTON, who majored in English and was 
President of the Brown University Literary Society, has had a 
rude initiation into the real world as one of Zenith House's four 
editors. Zenith House, which captured only 2% of the total 
paperback market the year before (1980), is dying on the vine. 
All of its employees are worried that Apex, the parent 
corporation, may soon take extreme measures to stem the tide 
of red ink...and the most likely possibility is looking more and 
more like terminating Zenith House, with extreme sanction. 
The only hope is a drastic sales turnaround, but with Zenith's 
tiny advances and creaky distribution system, that seems 
unlikely.</p>
<p class="synopsis">Enter CARLOS DETWEILLER, first in the form of a 
query letter received by John Kenton. Detweiller, twenty&#8212;three, 
works in the Central Falls House of Flowers and is hawking a 
book he's written, called <i>True Tales of Demon Infestations</i>. 
Kenton, with the vague idea that Detweiller may have some 
interesting stuff which can be rewritten by a staffer, encourages 
Detweiller to submit sample chapters and an outline. Detweiller 
instead submits the entire manuscript, along with a bundle of 
photographs. The mss is even more abysmal than Kenton&#8212;who 
thought the book could maybe be juiced up for The <i>Amityville 
Horror audience</i>&#8212;would have believed in his worst 
nightmares. Yet the worst nightmare of all is contained in the 
form of the enclosed photographs. Most are shots of painfully 
faked seance effects, but four of them show a gruesomely 
realistic human sacrifice, in which an old man's heart is being 
pulled from his gaping chest...and it seems very likely to 
Kenton that the fellow doing the pulling is none other than 
Carlos Detweiller himself.</p>
<p class="synopsis">ROGER WADE concurs with Kenton's feeling that they 
have stumbled into something which is probably a police 
matter&#8212;and a very nasty police matter at that. Kenton takes the 
photos to SGT. TYNDALE, who wires them to CHIEF 
IVERSON in Central Falls. Carlos Detweiller is arrested, then 
released when an officer assigned to surveillance sees the 
photos in question and remarks that he saw the so&#8212;called 
"sacrifice victim" sitting in the House of Flowers office that 
very day, playing solitaire and watching <i>Ryan's Hope</i> on TV.
Tyndale tries to comfort Kenton. Go home, he says, have a 
drink, forget it. You made a perfectly forgivable mistake in the 
course of trying to do your civic duty.</p>
<p class="synopsis">Kenton burns the "sacrifice photos," but he can't forget; 
he receives a letter from the obviously insane Carlos 
Detweiller, promising revenge. Two weeks later, he receives a 
letter from one "Roberta Solrac," who purports to be a great fan 
of Zenith's second&#8212;hottest author, Anthony La Scorbia (La 
Scorbia is responsible for a series of nature&#8212;run&#8212;amok novels 
such as <i>Rats from Hell</i>, <i>Ants from Hell</i>, and <i>Scorpions from 
Hell</i>). "She" claims to have sent La Scorbia roses, and wants to 
send Kenton, as La Scorbia's editor, a small plant "as a token of 
esteem."</p>
<p class="synopsis">Kenton, no fool, realizes at once that Solrac is Carlos 
spelled backward...and Detweiller, of course, worked in a 
greenhouse. Convinced that the "token of esteem" is apt to be 
something like deadly nightshade or belladonna, Kenton sends 
an interoffice memo to Riddley, instructing him to incinerate 
any package which comes to him from a "Roberta Solrac."</p>
<p class="synopsis">RIDDLEY WALKER, who respects Kenton more than 
Kenton himself would ever believe, agrees, but privately adopts 
a wait&#8212;and&#8212;see attitude. Near the end of February 1981, a 
package from "Roberta Solrac," addressed to John Kenton, 
actually does arrive. Riddley opens the package in spite of a 
strong feeling that the sender&#8212;Detweiller&#8212;is a terribly evil 
man. If so, the contents of the package are hardly in keeping 
with such notions; it is nothing more than a sickly&#8212;looking 
Common Ivy with a little plastic sign stuck into the earth of its 
pot. The sign reads:<br><br>

<br><p class="letterdate">February 25</p>
<p class "lettersalut">Dear Ruth,</p>
<p>I've got a case of the mean reds, so I thought I'd pass 
some of them on&#8212;see the enclosed Xeroxes, concluding with a 
typically impudent communication from Riddley, he of the 
coal&#8212;black skin and three hundred huge white teeth.</p>
<p>You'll notice that Roger kicked my ass good and hard&#8212;
not much like Roger, and doubly sobering for that very reason. 
I don't think one has to be very paranoid to see that he's talking 
about the possibility of firing me. If I'd talked this out with him 
over martinis at Flaherty's after work, I doubt very much if he 
would have come down so hard, and of course I had no idea he 
was waiting on a call from Enders. I undoubtedly deserved the 
ass&#8212;kicking I got&#8212;I <i>haven't</i> really been doing my job&#8212;but he 
has no idea of the scare that letter threw into me when I realized 
it was Detweiller again. I'm too goddam thin&#8212;skinned for my 
own good, that's what Roger thinks...but Detweiller is scary for 
other, less easily grasped reasons. Being the <i>idée</i> that's gotten 
<i>fixe</i> in some crazy's head has got to be one of the most 
uncomfortable feelings in the world&#8212;if I knew Jody Foster, I 
think I'd give her a jingle and tell her I know exactly how she 
feels. There's an almost palpable texture of slime about 
Detweiller's communications, and oh boy, oh yeah, I wish I 
<i>could</i> get him out of my head, but I still have nightmares about 
those pictures.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have taken care of matters as well as I can, 
and no, I have no intention of calling Central Falls. We have an 
editorial meeting tomorrow. I'll try to the best of my limited 
abilities to get back on the beam...except at Zenith House the 
beam is so narrow it almost doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I love you, I miss you, I long for your return. Maybe you 
being gone is part of the problem. Not to make you feel guilty.</p>

<p><div align="right"><p>2/23/81</p></div>
<p>Like a stone thrown into a large and stagnant pond, the 
Detweiller affair has caused any number of ripples at my place 
of employment. I thought that all of them had gone by; yet this 
afternoon one more rolled past, and who is to say even that one 
will be the last?</p>
<p>I have included a Xerox of an exceedingly curious memo 
I received from Kenton at 2:35 P.M. plus my own reply (the 
memo came just after Gelb left, in something of a huff; why he 
should have been in a huff eludes me since today he brought his 
own dice and I did him the courtesy of not even checking them, 
but Ah g'iss Ah woan <i>nevuh</i> understand dese white folks). I 
think I have covered the Detweiller affair to a nicety in these 
pages, but I should add that it never surprised me in the least 
that Kenton was the one to bring Detweiller, the rogue comet, 
into the erratic (and, I fear, degenerating) orbit of Zenith House.</p>
<p>He is brighter than Sandra Jackson; brighter than that crap&#8212;
shooting, Ivy League tie&#8212;wearing devil William Gelb; <i>far</i> 
brighter than Herbert Porter (Porter, as previously noted, is not 
above wandering into Ms. Jackson's office after she has left for 
the day and sniffing the seat of her office chair&#8212;a strange man, 
but be it not for me to judge), and the only one of the staff who 
<i>might</i> be capable of recognizing a commercial book if it came 
within his purview. Right now he is eaten up with guilt and 
embarrassment over <i>l'affaire Detweiller</i>, and can see only that 
he made a rather comic <i>faux pas</i>. He would be incapable of 
seeing that his decision to even <i>look</i> at the Detweiller book 
demonstrated that his editorial ears are still open, and still 
attuned to that sweetest of all tones&#8212;the celestial notes of 
Sweda cash registers in drugstores and book emporia ringing up 
sales, even if it was pointed out to him.</p>
<p>Incapable of seeing that it proves he's still trying.</p>
<p>The others have given up.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is this enchanting memo&#8212;between its 
lines I hear a man whose nerve is temporarily shot, a man who 
<i>might</i> be capable of facing a lion but who now cannot even look 
at a mouse; a man who is, in consequence, shrieking "Eeeek! 
Get rid of it! Get rid of it!" and swatting at it with the handiest 
broom, which in <i>dis</i> case jus happen t'be Riddley, who dus' de 
awfishes an wipe de windows an delivah de mail. Yassuh, Mist 
Kenton, I git rid of it fo you! I sholy goan get rid of dat hoodoo 
Solrac woman's package if she sen one!</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe John Kenton should have to 
face up to the consequences of his own actions&#8212;swat his own 
mouse. After all, if you don't swat your own, maybe you never 
really know what a harmless little thing a mouse is...and is it 
not possible that Kenton's useful days as an editor may be over 
if he cannot stare down such occasional crazies as Carlos 
"Roberta" Detweiller?</p>
<p>I shall ponder the matter. I think there is a very good 
chance no package will come, but I'll ponder it all the same.</p></p>
<p><div align="right"><p>2/27/81</p></div>
<p>Something from the mysterious "Roberta Solrac" 
actually came today! I didn't know whether to be amused or 
disgusted by my own reaction, which was staring, elemental 
gut&#8212;terror followed by an almost insane urge to put the thing 
down the incinerator, exactly as Kenton's note had instructed. 
The <i>physicality</i> of my reaction as soon as my eye fell on the 
return address and connected the name there with Kenton's 
memo was striking. I had a sudden spasm of shudders. 
Goosebumps raced up my back. I heard a clear, ringing tone in 
my ears, and I could feel the hair stiffening on my head.
This symphony of physiological atavism lasted no more than 
five seconds and then it subsided&#8212;but it left me as shaken as a 
sudden deep lance of pain in the area of the heart. Floyd would 
sneer and call it "a nigger reaction," but it was no such thing. It 
was a <i>human</i> reaction. Not to the thing itself&#8212;the contents of 
the package were something of an anticlimax after all the sound 
and fury&#8212;but, I am convinced, to the hands which placed the 
lid on the small white cardboard box in which the plant came; 
the hands which tied twine around that box and then cut a 
brown paper shopping bag in which to wrap the box for 
mailing, the hands which taped and labelled and carried. 
Detweiller's hands.</p>
<p>Am I speaking of telepathy? Yes...and no. It might be 
fairer to say that I am speaking of a kind of passive 
psychokinesis. Dogs shy away from people with cancer; they 
smell it on them. So, at least, claims my dear old Aunt 
Olympia. In the same way I smelled Detweiller all over that 
box, and now I understand Kenton's upset better and have a 
good deal more sympathy for him. I think Carlos Detweiller 
must be dangerously insane...but the plant itself is no deadly 
nightshade or belladonna or Adder Toadstool (although it may 
have been any or all of those things in Detweiller's feverish 
mind, I suppose). It's only a very small and very tired&#8212;looking 
common ivy in a red clay pot.</p>
<p>If not for the "nigger reaction" (Floyd Walker)&#8212;or the 
"human reaction" (his brother Riddley)&#8212;I might really have 
dumped the thing...but after that fit of the shakes, it seemed to 
me I had to go through with opening the package or deem 
myself less a man. I did so, in spite of any number of gruesome 
images&#8212;high explosive rigged to special pressure&#8212;tapes, 
noxious floods of black widow spiders, a litter of baby 
copperheads. And there it was, just a small ivy&#8212;plant with 
yellow&#8212;edged leaves (four of them) nodding from one tired, 
sagging stem. The soil itself is waxy brown. It smells swampy 
and unpleasant.</p>
<p>There was a little plastic sign stuck in the earth which 
read:<br><br>
</p>
<p><b><center>HI!<br>
MY NAME IS ZENITH<br>
I AM A GIFT TO JOHN<br>
FROM ROBERTA<br><br>
</center></b></p>
<br><p>It was that flash of fear which drove me to open the 
package. Similarly, it's that same flash which has decided me 
against making sure that Kenton gets it after all, which would 
have been easy enough to do ("<i>Dat</i> plant, Mist Kenton? Oh, 
<i>drat</i>! I g'iss I fo'got whatchoo said. I am de mos <i>f'gitten'est</i> 
man!"). Let the ripples end; let him forget Detweiller, if that's 
what he wants. I've put Zenith the Common Ivy on a shelf in 
my janitorial&#8212;cum&#8212;mailroom cubicle&#8212;a shelf well above 
Kenton's eye&#8212;level (not that he stops in much anyway, unlike 
Gelb with his dice fixation). I'll keep it until it dies, and then I 
really <i>will</i> dump it down the incinerator chute. That will be the 
end of Detweiller fo <i>sho</i>.</p>

From <i>The New York Post</i>, page 1, March 4, 1981:<br>
<b><p>INSANE GENERAL ESCAPES OAK COVE ASYLUM,
KILLS THREE!!</b></p><br>
</p>
<p>(Special to the <i>Post</i>) Major General (ret.) Anthony R. 
Hecksler, known to the commandos and partisans who followed 
him across France during World War II as "Iron&#8212;Guts" 
Hecksler, escaped from Oak Cove Asylum late last night, 
stabbing two orderlies and a nurse to death in his bid for 
freedom.</p>
<p>General Hecksler was remanded to Oak Cove in the 
small upstate town of Cutlersville twenty&#8212;seven months ago, 
following his acquittal, by reason of insanity, on charges of 
assault with a deadly weapon and assault with intent to kill. His 
victim was Albany bus driver Herman T. Schneur, whom 
Hecksler claimed in a signed statement to be "one of the twelve 
North American foremen of the antichrist."</p>
<p>The Oak Cove dead have been identified as Norman 
Ableson, twenty&#8212;six; John Piet, forty; and Alicia Penbroke, 
thirty&#8212;four.</p>
<p>State Police Lieutenant Arthur P. Ford was surprisingly 
gloomy when asked if he expected to recapture General 
Hecksler quickly. "We hope for a quick arrest, naturally," he 
said, "but this is a man who trained guerilla units in World War 
II and in Korea, and who was consulted on more than one 
occasion by General Westmoreland in Viet Nam. He's seventy&#8212;
two now, but still strong and amazingly agile, as his escape 
from Oak Cove shows."</p>
<p>Ford indicated he was referring to Hecksler's probable method 
of escape&#8212;a leap from a second floor window in the Oak Cove 
Administration Wing to the garden below (see photographs on 
pages 2, 3, and Center Section).</p>
<p>Ford went on to caution everyone within the immediate 
area to be on the lookout for the mad General, whom he 
described as "extremely clever, extremely dangerous, and 
extremely paranoid."</p>
<p>In a brief press interview, Ellen K. Moors, the doctor in 
charge of Hecksler's case, agreed. "He had a great many 
enemies," she said, "or so he imagined. His paranoid delusions 
were extremely complex, but he never lost track of the score. 
He was, in his way, a model inmate...but he never lost track of 
the score."</p>
<p>A source close to the investigation says Hecksler may 
have stabbed Ableson, Piet, and Pembroke to death with a pair 
of barber's shears. The source told the Post that there was no 
outcry; all three were stabbed in the throat, commando&#8212;style.</P</p>

<p>What a difference a day makes!</p>
<p>Yesterday Herb Porter was his usual self&#8212;fat, slovenly, 
smoking a cigar as he stood by the water&#8212;cooler, explaining to 
Kenton and Gelb how the great train of the world would run if 
he, Herbert Porter, were the engineer. The man is a walking 
<b>Reader's Digest</b> of rabbit&#8212;punch solutions, a compendium of 
declarative answers which are delivered amid the effluvium of 
cigar smoke and exquisitely bad breath. Close the borders and 
keep out the spies and wetbacks! End abortion on demand! 
Build more prisons! Upgrade possession of marijuana to a 
felony once again! Sell biochemical stocks! Buy cable&#8212;TV 
issues!</p>
<p>He is, in his way&#8212;or was, until today&#8212;a wonderful 
man: rounded and perfect in his assurances, plated with 
prejudices, caprisoned about with cant, and possessed of just 
enough native wit to hold a job in a place like this, Porter is an 
evocation of the Great American Median. Even his occasional 
surreptitious expeditions into Sandra Jackson's office to sniff 
the seat of her chair please me&#8212;an endearing little loophole in 
the walking castle of complacency that is Massa Po'tuh.</p>
<p>Oh, but today! What a different Herbert Porter crept into 
my janitorial cubbyhole today! The complacent, ruddy face had 
become pallid and trembling. The blue eyes shifted so regularly 
from side to side that Porter looked like a man watching a 
tennis match even when he was trying to stare right at me. His 
lips were so shiny with spittle that they looked almost 
varnished. And while he was of course still fat, he also looked 
as if he had somehow lost his surface tension&#8212;as if the 
essential Herb Porter had shrunk away from the borders of his 
skin, leaving that skin to sag in places where it had been 
previously stretched smooth.</p>
<p>"He's out," Porter whispered.</p>
<p>"Who's dat, Mist Po'tuh?" I asked. I was genuinely 
curious; I could not imagine what mighty sling or engine could 
have breached such a gap in Castle Herbert. Although I suppose 
I should have guessed.</p>
<p>He proffered me the paper&#8212;the <i>Post</i>, of course. He's the 
only one around here who reads it. Kenton and Wade read the 
<i>Times</i>, Gelb and Jackson <i>bring</i> the <i>Times</i> but secretly read the 
<i>Daily News</i> (the hand that rocks the cradle may rule the world, 
but de han which empty de white folks' wastebaskets know de 
secrets of de worl), but the <i>Post</i> was made for fellows such as 
Herb Porter. He plays Wingo religiously and says if he ever 
wins a bundle he is going to buy a Winnebago, paint the word 
WINGOBAGO on the side, and tour the country.</p>
<p>I took it, opened it, and read the headline.</p>
<p>"The General's escaped," he whispered. His eyes stopped 
bouncing back and forth for a moment and he stared at me in 
dismay and utter horror. "It's as if that damned Detweiller 
cursed us. The General's escaped <i>and I rejected his book</i>!"</p>
<p>"Now, now, Mist Po'tuh," I said. "Ain't no need to take on so. 
Man lak dis prob'ly got fo&#8212;five dozen scores to settle befo he 
git to you."</p>
<p>"But I could be number one," he whispered. "After all, I 
rejected his goddam <i>book</i>."</p>
<p>It was true, and it is ironic how two such fundamentally 
different men as Kenton and Porter have managed to get 
themselves into exactly the same situation this late winter&#8212;
each the target of a rejected author (Detweiller's rejection a bit 
more dramatic than that of the Major&#8212;General, granted, but that 
was indubitably Detweiller's own fault) who just happens to be 
insane. The difference&#8212;I know it, even if no one else does (and 
I believe Roger Wade might)&#8212;is that, while Kenton thought 
there might actually be the germ of a book in Detweiller's 
obsession, Porter knew better concerning the General's. But 
Porter is one of those men who has read omnivorously&#8212;and 
vicariously&#8212;about World War II, that Pickett's Charge of 
western man (western <i>white</i> man) in the 20th century, and he 
knew who Hecksler was...in a war filled with military 
celebrities Hecksler was, granted, of the Hollywood Squares 
type (if you see what I mean), but to Porter he was somebody. 
So he asked to see the completed manuscript of <i>Twenty Psychic 
Garden Flowers</i> in spite of the abysmal outline, thereby 
encouraging a man who was, by the quality and content of his 
own written words, a palpable psychotic. I felt that the result 
and his present terror, although unforeseen, were partly his own 
fault.</p>
<p>I allowed as how it was true that he could be number one 
on the General's hit list (if indeed the poor madman is doing 
anything other than cowering in drainage ditches or scouring 
alley garbage cans for offal at this point), but reiterated that I 
thought it unlikely. I added that he might well be caught before 
he could get within fifty miles of New York City even if he had 
decided to come after Porter, and finished by telling him that 
many psychotics released suddenly into an uncontrolled 
environment took their own lives...although I did not say so in 
exactly those words.</p>
<p>Porter regarded me suspiciously for a moment and then 
said, "Riddley&#8212;don't take offense at this&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Nawsah!"</p>
<p>"Have you <i>really</i> been to college?"</p>
<p>"<i>Yassah!</i>"</p>
<p>"And you took psychology courses?"</p>
<p>"Yassah, I sho did."</p>
<p>"<i>Abnormal</i> psychology?"</p>
<p>"Yassah, and I'se pow'ful familier wid de suicidial 
syndrome associated wid de paranoid&#8212;psychotic personality! 
Why, dat Gen'l Hecksler could be slittin' his wrists or garglin' 
wid a lightbulb even while we's heah talkin, Mist Po'tuh!"</p>
<p>He looked at me for a long time and then said, "If you've 
been to college, Riddley, why do you talk that way?"</p>
<p>"What way is dat, Mist Po&#8212;tuh?"</p>
<p>He regarded me for a moment longer and then said, 
"Never mind." He leaned close&#8212;close enough so I could smell 
cheap cigars, hair tonic, and the graywater stench of fear. "Can 
you get me a gun?"</p>
<p>For a moment I was literally without a response&#8212;which 
is like saying (Floyd would, anyway) that China was for a 
moment without manpower. I had an idea that he had changed 
the subject completely, and that what I had heard as <i>Can you 
get me a gun</i>? had actually been <i>Can you get me some fun</i>, as in 
ho. Definition of a ho: dahk&#8212;skin woman who do it fo money on 
account of de food&#8212;stamps is gone and de las fix be cookin in de 
spoon. My response was to either fall down, shrieking wildly 
with laughter, or to throttle him until his face was as purple as 
his tie. Then, belatedly, I began to understand he really <i>had</i> said 
gun...but in the meantime he had taken the overload in my 
mental switchboard for refusal. His face fell.</p>
<p>"You're sure?" he asked. "I thought that up there in 
Harlem&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Ah lives in Dobbs Ferry, Mist' Po'tuh!"</p>
<p>He merely waved this aside, as if we both knew my 
Dobbs Ferry address was just a convenient fiction I 
maintained&#8212;that I might even actually go there after work, but 
of course was drawn back to the velvety reaches beyond 110th 
as soon as the sun went down.</p>
<p>"Ah g'iss I could git you a gun, Mist' Po'tuh, suh," I 
said, "but it wouldn't be no better or wuss'n one you could git 
yo'sef&#8212;a .32...maybe a .38..." I winked at him. "And a gun you 
buy under de countuh in a bah, cain't never tell it ain't goan 
blow up in yo face fust time you pulls de triggah!"</p>
<p>"I don't want anything like that, anyway," Porter said 
morosely. "I want something with a laser sight. And exploding 
bullets. Did you ever see <i>Day of the Jackal</i>, Riddley?"</p>
<p>"Yassah, and it sho was fine!"</p>
<p>"When he shot the watermelon...<i>plowch</i>!" Porter tossed 
his arms wide to indicate how the watermelon had exploded 
when the assassin tried an exploding bullet on it in <i>The Day of 
the Jackal</i>, and one of his hands struck the ivy sent to Kenton 
by the mysterious Roberta Solrac. I had all but forgotten it, 
although it's been less than two weeks since I put it up there.
I tried to assure Porter again that he was probably far from the 
top of Hecksler's perhaps infinite list of pet paranoias, and that 
the man was, after all, seventy&#8212;two.</p>
<p>"You don't know some of the stuff he did in Big Two," 
Porter said, his eyes beginning to move hauntedly from side to 
side again. "If those guys who hired the Jackal had hired 
Hecksler instead, DeGaulle never would have died in the rack."
He wandered off then, and I was glad to see him go. The smell 
of cigars was beginning to make me feel mildly ill. I took down 
Zenith the Common Ivy and looked at him (it is ridiculous to 
assign a male pronoun to an ivy, and yet I did it 
automatically&#8212;I, who usually write with the shrewish care of a 
French <i>petit bourgeoise</i> housewife picking over fruit in the 
marketplace). I began this entry by saying what a difference a 
day makes. In the case of Zenith the Common Ivy, what a 
difference <i>five</i> days has made. The sagging stem has 
straightened and thickened, the four yellowish leaves have 
become almost wholly green, and two new ones have begun to 
unfurl. All of this with absolutely no help from me at all. I 
watered it, plucked out the ridiculous little sign and threw it 
away, and noticed two other things about my good old buddy 
Zenith&#8212;first, it's even put out its first tendril&#8212;it barely reaches 
to the lip of the cheap plastic pot, but it's there&#8212;and second, 
that swampy, unpleasant smell seems to have disappeared. In 
fact both the plant and the soil in which he is potted smell quite 
sweet.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's a psychic ivy. If General Hecksler shows up 
here at good old 490 Park, I must be sure to ask him, hee&#8212;hee!
Got twenty pages done on the novel this week&#8212;not 
much, but think (hope!) I am approaching the halfway point.
Gelb, who had a modest run of luck yesterday, tried to push it 
today&#8212;this was about an hour before Porter hopped in, looking 
for armaments. Gelb now owes me $81.50.</p></p>
<br><p class="letterdate">March 8, 1981</p>
<p  class="lettersalut">Dear Ruth,</p>
<p>Just lately you've been harder to reach on the phone than 
the President of the United States&#8212;I swear to God I'm getting 
to hate your answering machine! I must confess that tonight&#8212;
the third night of "Hi, this is Ruth and I can't come to the phone 
right now, but..."&#8212;I got a little nervous and called the other 
number you gave me&#8212;the super. If he hadn't told me he'd seen 
you going out around five with a big load of books under your 
arm, I think I might have asked him to check and make sure 
you were okay. I know, I know, it's just the time difference, but 
things have gotten so paranoid here lately that you wouldn't 
believe it. Paranoid? <i>Weird</i> is a better word, maybe. We'll 
probably talk before you receive this, making ninety per cent of 
this letter obsolete (unless I send it Federal Express, which 
makes long distance look like an austerity measure), but if I 
don't narrate it by some means or other I think I may explode. I 
understand from Herb Porter, who is nearly apoplectic (a 
condition I sympathize with more than I would heretofore have 
believed, following <i>l'affair</i> Detweiller), that General Hecksler's 
escape and the murders which attended it have made the 
national news the last two nights, but I assume you haven't seen 
it&#8212;or didn't make the connection&#8212;or I would have heard from 
you via Ma Tinkerbell ere now (prolix as ever, you see&#8212;would 
that I could be as succinct as Zenith's faithful custodian 
Riddley!). If you <i>haven't</i> heard, the enclosed Post clipping (I 
didn't bother to include the centerfold photo of the asylum with 
the obligatory dotted line marking the dotty General's likely 
route of escape and the obligatory X's marking the locations of 
his victims) will bring you up to date as quickly and luridly as 
possible.</p>
<p>You may remember that I mentioned Hecksler to you in a 
letter only six weeks ago&#8212;something like that, anyway. Herb 
rejected his book, <i>Twenty Psychic Garden Flowers</i>, and 
provoked a barrage of paranoid hate&#8212;mail. Joking aside, his 
bloody escape has created a real atmosphere of unease here at 
Z.H. I had a drink with Roger Wade after work tonight in Four 
Fathers (Roger claims that the owner, a genial man named 
Ginelli with a soft voice and these odd, gleeful eyes, is a 
<i>mafioso</i>) and told him about Herb's visit to me that afternoon. I 
pointed out to Herb that it was ridiculous for him to be as 
frightened as he obviously is (it's sort of funny&#8212;under his 
steely Joe Pyne Exterior, the resident Neanderthal turns out to 
be Walter Mitty after all) and Herb agreed. Then, after a certain 
amount of patently artificial small talk, he asked me if I knew 
where he could get a gun. Mystified&#8212;sometimes your ob'dt 
correspondent is amazingly slow in making the obvious 
connections, m'dear&#8212;I mentioned the sporting goods store five 
blocks from here, at Park and 32nd.</p>
<p>"No," he said impatiently. "I don't want a shotgun or 
anything like that." Here he lowered his voice. "I want 
something I can carry around with me."</p>
<p>Roger nodded and said Herb had been into his office 
around two, feeling him out on the same subject.</p>
<p>"What did you say?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"I reminded him that the penalties for carrying concealed 
weapons without a permit in this state are damned severe," 
Roger said. "At which point Herb drew himself up to his full 
height [which is, Ruth, about five&#8212;seven] and said, 'A man 
doesn't need a permit to protect himself, Roger.'"</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>"Then he walked out. And tried you. Probably tried Bill 
Gelb as well."</p>
<p>"Don't forget Riddley," I said.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes&#8212;and Riddley."</p>
<p>"Who might just be able to help him."</p>
<p>Roger ordered another bourbon, and I was thinking how 
much older than his actual forty&#8212;five he is coming to look when 
he suddenly grinned that boyish, winning grin that so charmed 
you when you first met him at that cocktail party in June of 
'80&#8212;the one at Gahan and Nancy Wilson's place in 
Connecticut, do you remember? "Have you seen Sandra 
Jackson's new toy?" he asked. "<i>She's</i> the one Herb should have 
gone to for black market munitions." Roger actually laughed 
out loud, a sound I have heard from him very seldom in the last 
eight months or so. Hearing it made me realize again, Ruth, 
how much I like and respect him&#8212;he could have been a really 
great editor somewhere&#8212;perhaps even in the Maxwell Perkins 
league. It seems a shame that he's ended up piloting such a 
leaky craft as Zenith House.</p>
<p>"She's got something called the Rainy Night Friend," he 
said, still laughing. "It's silver&#8212;plated, and almost the size of a 
mortar shell. Fucking thing fills her whole purse. There's a 
flashlight set into the blunt end. The tapered end emits a cloud 
of tear&#8212;gas when you press a button&#8212;only Sandra says that she 
spent an extra ten bucks to have the tear&#8212;gas canister replaced 
with Hi&#8212;Pro&#8212;Gas, which is a hopped&#8212;up version of Mace. In the 
middle of this device, Johnny boy, is a pull&#8212;ring that sets off a 
high&#8212;decibel siren. I did not ask for a demonstration. They 
would have evacuated the building."</p>
<p>"The way you describe it, it sounds as if she could use it 
as a dildo when there were no muggers around," I said.
He went off into gales of half&#8212;hysterical laughter. I joined 
him&#8212;it would have been impossible not to&#8212;but I was 
concerned for him, as well. He's very tired and very close to the 
edge of his endurance, I think&#8212;the parent corporation's 
steadily eroding support for the house has really started to get to 
him.</p>
<p>I asked him if something like the Rainy Night Friend was 
legal.</p>
<p>"I'm not a lawyer so I couldn't tell you for sure," Roger 
said. "My impression is that a woman who uses a tear&#8212;gas pen 
on a potential mugger or rapist is in a gray area. But Sandra's 
toy, loaded up with a Mace hybrid...no, I don't think something 
like that can be kosher."</p>
<p>"But she's got it, and she's carrying it," I said.</p>
<p>"Not only that, but she seems fairly calm about it all," 
Roger agreed. "Funny&#8212;she was the one who was so scared 
when the General was sending his poison pen letters, and Herb 
hardly seemed aware any of it was going on...at least until the 
bus driver got stabbed. I think what freaked Sandra out before 
was that she'd never seen him."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said. "She even told me that once."</p>
<p>He paid the tab, waving away my offer to pay my half. 
"It's the revenge of the flower&#8212;people," he said. "First 
Detweiller, the mad gardener from Central Falls, and then
Hecksler, the mad gardener from Oak Cove."</p>
<p>That gave me what the British mystery writers like to call 
a nasty start&#8212;talk about not making obvious connections! 
Roger, who is far from being anyone's fool, saw my expression 
and smiled.</p>
<p>"Didn't think of that, did you?" he asked. "It's just a 
coincidence, of course, but I guess it was enough to set off a 
little paranoid chime in Herb Porter's head&#8212;I can't imagine 
him getting so fashed otherwise. We could have the basis of a 
good Robert Ludlum novel here. The <i>Horticultural Something&#8212;
or&#8212;Other</i>. Come on, let's get out of here."</p>
<p>"<i>Convergence</i>," I said as we hit the street.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Roger looked like someone coming back from a 
million miles away.</p>
<p>"<i>The Horticultural Convergence</i>," I said. "The perfect 
Ludlum title. Even the perfect Ludlum plot. It turns out, see, 
that Detweiller and Hecksler are actually brothers&#8212;no, 
considering the ages, I guess father and son would be better&#8212;in 
the pay of the NKVD. And&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I've got to catch my bus, John," he said, not unkindly. 
Well, I have my problems, dear Ruth (who knows better than 
you?), but realizing when I'm being a bore has never been one 
of them (except when I'm drunk). I saw him down to the bus 
stop and headed home.</p>
<p>The last thing he said was that the next we heard of 
General Hecksler would probably be a report of his capture...or 
his suicide. And Herb Porter would be disappointed as well as 
relieved.</p>
<p>"It isn't General Hecksler Herb and the rest of us have to 
be worried about," he said&#8212;his little burst of good humor had 
left him and he looked slumped and small, standing there at the 
bus stop with his hands jammed into the pockets of his 
trenchcoat. "It's Harlow Enders and the rest of the accountants 
who are going to get us. They'll stab us with their red pencils. 
When I think about Enders, I almost wish I had Sandra 
Jackson's Rainy Night Friend."</p>
<p>No progress on my novel this week&#8212;looking back over 
this epistle I see why&#8212;all this narrative that should have gone 
into <i>Maymonth</i> tonight went ended up here instead. But if I 
went on too long and in too much novelistic detail, don't chalk 
it <i>all</i> up to prolixity, my dear&#8212;over the last six months or so I 
have become a genuine Lonely Guy. Writing to you isn't as 
good as talking to you, and talking to you isn't as good as 
seeing you, and seeing you isn't as good as touching you and 
being with you (steam&#8212;steam! pant&#8212;pant!), but a person has to 
make do with what he has. I know you're busy, studying hard, 
but going so long without talking to you has got me sorta crazy 
(and on top of Detweiller and Hecksler, more crazy I do not 
need to be). I love you, my dear.</p>

<p class="lettersign">JOHN</p>
<p class="letterdate">March 10, 1981</p>
<p>Dear John,</p>
<p>I imagine&#8212;no, I <i>know</i>&#8212;you must be wondering why you 
haven't heard from me much over the last three weeks. The 
reason is simple enough; I've been feeling guilty. And the 
reason I am writing now instead of calling is that I am a 
coward. Also I think, although you may not believe me when 
you read the rest of this, which is the hardest letter I've ever 
had to write, because I love you very much and want so much 
not to hurt you. All the same I suppose this will hurt and 
knowing I can't help it makes me cry.</p>
<p>John, I've met a man named Toby Anderson and have 
fallen head over heels in love with him. If it matters to you&#8212;
and it probably won't&#8212;I met him in one of the two English 
Restoration drama courses I'm taking. I held him off as best as I 
could for a long time&#8212;I very much want and need you to 
believe that&#8212;but by mid&#8212;February I just couldn't hold him off 
any longer. My arms got tired.</p>
<p>The last three weeks or so have been a nightmare for me. 
I don't really expect you to sympathize with my position, but I 
hope you'll believe I am telling the truth. Although you're on 
the east coast and I'm three thousand miles away on the west, I 
felt as if I were sneaking around on you. And I was. I was! Oh, 
I don't mean in the sense that you might come home early from 
work one night and find me with Toby, but I felt terrible all the 
same. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't do my yoga 
positions or the Jane Fonda Workout. My grades were slipping, 
but to hell with the grades&#8212;my heart was slipping.</p>
<p>I've been ducking your calls because I couldn't bear to 
hear your voice&#8212;it seemed to bring it all home to me&#8212;how I 
was lying and cheating and leading you on.</p>
<p>It all came to a head two nights ago when Toby showed 
me the lovely diamond engagement ring he had bought for me. 
He said he wanted me to have it and he hoped I wanted to take 
it, but he said he couldn't give it to me even if I did until I 
talked or wrote to you. He's such an honorable man, John, and 
the irony is that under different circumstances I am sure you 
would like him very much.</p>
<p>I broke down and cried in his arms and before long his 
tears were mingled with mine. The upshot of it all was me 
saying I would be ready for him to slip that gorgeous love&#8212;ring 
on my finger by the end of the week. I think we are going to be 
married in June.</p>
<p>You see that in the end I took the coward's way out, 
writing instead of phoning, and it's still taken me the last two 
days to get this much down&#8212;I've cut every class and have 
practically put down roots in the library karel where I should be 
studying for a Transformational Grammar prelim. But to hell 
with Noam Chomsky and deep structure! And although you 
may not believe this either, each word of the letter you're 
reading has been like a lash across my heart.</p>
<p>If you want to talk to me, John&#8212;I'd understand if you 
didn't but you may&#8212;you could call me in a week...after you've 
had a chance to think all this over and get it into some kind of 
perspective. I am so used to your sweetness and charm and 
kindness, and so afraid you'll be angry and accusatory&#8212;but 
that is up to you and I'll just have to "take you as you are," I 
suppose. But you need that time to cool off and settle down, 
and I need some time, too. You should receive this on the 
eleventh. I'll be in my apartment from seven to nine&#8212;thirty on 
the nights of the eighteenth through the twenty&#8212;second, both 
expecting your call and dreading it. I won't want to speak to 
you before then, and I hope you understand&#8212;and I think maybe 
you will, you who were always the most understanding of men 
in spite of your constant self&#8212;deprecation.</p>
<p>One other thing&#8212;both Toby and I are in agreement about 
this: don't take it in your head to just suddenly jump on a plane 
and "wing your way into the golden west"&#8212;I wouldn't see you 
if you did. I'm not ready to see you face to face, John&#8212;my 
feelings are still too much in flux and my self&#8212;image too much 
in a state of transition. We will meet again, yes. And dare I say 
that I even hope you will come to our wedding? I <i>must</i> dare, as 
I see I have written it down!</p>
<p>Oh, John, I <i>do</i> love you, and I hope this letter has not 
caused you too much pain&#8212;I even hope God has been good 
and you may have found your own "<i>somebody</i>" in the last 
couple of weeks&#8212;in the meantime, please know that you will 
always (always!) be somebody to me.</p>
<p class="lettersign">My love,<br>
Ruth<br>
PS&#8212;And although it is trite, it is also true: I hope we can 
<i>always</i> be friends.</p>

TO:   Roger Wade<br>
FROM:  John Kenton<br>
RE:  Resignation</p>
<p>I've been a trifle formal here because this really is a letter 
of resignation, Roger, memo form or no. I'll be leaving at the 
end of the day&#8212;will, in fact, begin cleaning out my desk as 
soon as I've finished this. I'd rather not go into my reasons&#8212;
they are personal. I realize, of course, that leaving with no prior 
notice is very bad form. Should you choose to take the matter 
up with the Apex Corporation, I would be happy to pay a 
reasonable assessment. I'm sorry about this, Roger. I like and 
respect you a great deal, but this simply has to be.</p>
<p class="journalheader">From John Kenton's diary</p>
<p class="letterdate">March 16, 1981</p>
<p>I haven't tried to keep a diary since I was eleven years 
old, when my Aunt Susan&#8212;dead lo these many years&#8212;gave 
me a small pocket diary for my birthday. It was just a cheap 
little thing; like Aunt Susan herself, now that I think about it.
I kept that diary, off and on (mostly off) for almost three weeks. 
I might not get even that far this time, but it doesn't really 
matter. This was Roger's idea, and Roger's ideas are sometimes 
good.</p>
<p>I've junked the novel&#8212;oh, don't think I did anything 
melodramatic like casting it into the fire to commemorate the 
spontaneous combustion of My First Serious Love; I'm actually 
writing this first (and maybe last) entry in my diary on the 
backs of the manuscript pages. But junking a novel doesn't 
have anything to do with the actual pages, anyway; what's on 
the pages is just so much dead skin. The novel actually falls 
apart inside your head, it seems, like the parson's wonderful 
one&#8212;hoss shay. Maybe the only good thing about Ruth's 
cataclysmic letter is that it's put paid to my grandiose literary 
aspirations. <i>Maymonth</i>, by John Edward Kenton, sucked that 
fabled hairy bird.</p>
<p>Does one need to begin a diary with background 
information? This was not a question which crossed my mind 
when I was eleven&#8212;at least not that I recall. And in spite of the 
great shitload of English courses I've taken in my time, I don't 
recall ever attending one which covered the Protocol of 
Journals. Footnotes, synopses, outlines, the proper placement of 
modifiers, the correct form of the business letter&#8212;these were 
all things in which I took instruction. But on how to start a 
diary I am as blank as I am, say, on how to continue your life 
after its light just went out.</p>
<p>Here is my decision, after a full thirty seconds of weighty 
consideration: a little background information wouldn't hurt. 
My name, as mentioned above, is John Edward Kenton; I am 
twenty&#8212;six years of age; I attended Brown University, where I 
majored in English, served as President of the Milton Society, 
and was exceedingly full of myself; I believed that everything 
in my life would eventually turn out just fine; I have since 
learned better. My father is dead, my mother alive and well and 
living in Sanford, Maine. I have three sisters. Two are married; 
the third is living at home and will finish her senior year at 
Sanford High this June.</p>
<p>I live in a two&#8212;room Soho apartment which I thought 
quite pleasant until the last few days; now it seems drab. I work 
for a seedy book company which publishes paperback originals, 
most of them about giant bugs and Viet Nam veterans out to 
reform the world with automatic weapons. Three days ago I 
found out my girl has left me for another man. Some response 
to this seemed to be required, so I tried to quit my job. No sense 
trying to go into my mental state either then or now. It was 
none too calm to begin with, due to an outbreak of what I can 
only call Crazy Fever at work. I may elaborate on <i>that</i> business 
at some later date, but for the time being the importance of 
Detweiller and Hecksler seems to have receded far into the 
background.</p>
<p>If you have ever been abruptly left by someone you did 
and do love deeply, you'll know the sort of fugue I have been 
experiencing. If you haven't, you can't. Simple as that.
I keep wanting to say <i>I feel the way I did when my father died</i>, 
but I don't. Part of me (the part that, writer or not, constantly 
wants to make metaphors) would like to make it into a 
bereavement, and I believe Roger was partly right when he 
made that comparison at the mostly liquid dinner we had the 
night of my resignation, but there are other elements, too. It is a 
separation&#8212;as if someone told you that you could no longer 
have your favorite food, or use a drug to which you had become 
addicted. And there's something worse. However you define 
the thing, I find that my own sense of self&#8212;esteem and self&#8212;
worth have somehow gotten mixed up in it, and it hurts. It hurts 
a lot. And it seems to hurt all the time. I always used to be able 
to escape mental pain and psychic distress in my sleep, but 
that's no good this time. It hurts there, too.</p>
<p>Ruth's letter (question: how many Dear John letters have 
actually been sent to Johns? Should we form a club, like the Jim 
Smith Society?) came on the eleventh&#8212;it was waiting in my 
mailbox like a time&#8212;bomb when I got home. I scribbled my 
resignation on a memo form the next morning and sent it down 
to Roger Wade's office via Riddley, who is our janitor <i>cum</i> 
mail&#8212;clerk at Zenith House. Roger came down to my office as if 
he had rockets on his heels. In spite of the pain I'm feeling and 
the daze I seem to be living in I was absurdly touched. After a 
short, intense conversation (to my shame I broke down and 
wept, and although I managed to refrain from telling him 
specifically what the problem was/is, I think he guessed) I 
agreed to defer my resignation, at least until that evening, when 
Roger suggested we get together and talk the situation over.
"A couple of drinks and a medium&#8212;rare steak may help to put 
the situation in perspective," was the way he put it, but I think it 
actually turned out to be more like a dozen drinks...each, 
maybe. I lost count. And it was to be Four Fathers again, 
naturally. At least a place for which I have no associations with 
Ruth.</p>
<p>After agreeing to Roger's dinner suggestion, I went 
home, slept for the rest of the day, and woke up feeling thick 
and dazed and headachey&#8212;that feeling of mild hangover I am 
left with whenever I get too much sleep I don't really need. It 
was 5:30, almost dark, and in the unlovely light of a late winter 
dusk I couldn't imagine why in God's name I had allowed 
Roger to talk me into the compromise measure of making my 
resignation provisional for even twelve hours. I felt like an ear 
of corn on which someone has performed a fabulous magic 
trick. Taken the corn and the cob and left the green shield of 
leaves and the fine yellow&#8212;white poll of tassel intact.</p>
<p>I am aware&#8212;God knows I have read enough to be&#8212;of 
how Byronic&#8212;Keatsian&#8212;Sorrows&#8212;of&#8212;Young&#8212;Werther that sounds, 
but one of the diary joys I discovered at eleven and may be 
rediscovering now is that you write with no audience&#8212;real or 
imagined&#8212;in mind. You can say whatever you fucking well 
want.</p>
<p>I took a very long shower, mostly just standing dazedly 
under the spray with a bar of soap in one hand, and then I dried 
off and dressed and sat in front of the TV until quarter of seven 
or so, when it was time to go off and meet Roger. I took Ruth's 
letter off my desk and stuffed it into my pocket just before I 
left, deciding that Roger ought to know just what had derailed 
me. Was I looking for sympathy? A tender ear, as the poet 
says? I don't know. But mostly I think I wanted him to be 
sure&#8212;really, really sure&#8212;that I wasn't just a rat deserting a 
sinking ship. Because I really like Roger, and I'm sorry for the 
jam he's in.</p>
<p>I could describe him&#8212;and if he were a character in one 
of my fictions I suppose I would do so lovingly, in too much 
detail&#8212;but since this diary is for me alone and I know perfectly 
well what Roger looks like, having trod the metaphoric grapes 
just down the hall from him for the last seventeen months, there 
is really no need to. I find that fact unaccountably liberating. 
The only salient points about Roger are that he is forty&#8212;five, 
looks eight to ten years older, smokes too much, is three&#8212;times 
divorced...and that I like him very much.</p>
<p>When we were settled at a table in the back of Fathers 
with drinks in front of us, he asked me what was wrong besides 
the obvious unfortunacies of this evil year. I took Ruth's letter 
out of my pocket and tossed it wordlessly across the table to 
him. While he read it I finished my drink and ordered another. 
When the waiter came with it Roger finished his own drink at a 
gulp, ordered another, and laid Ruth's letter beside his plate. 
His eyes were still going over it.</p>
<p>"'Before long his tears were mingled with mine'?" he 
said in a low just&#8212;talking&#8212;to&#8212;myself voice. "'Each word has 
been like a lash across my heart'? Jesus, I wonder if she's ever 
considered writing bodice&#8212;rippers. There just might be 
something there."</p>
<p>"Cut it out, Roger. That isn't funny."</p>
<p>"No, I suppose not," he said, and looked at me with an 
expression of sympathy that was at the same time deeply 
comforting and deeply embarrassing. "I doubt if much of 
anything seems very funny to you now."</p>
<p>"Not even slightly," I agreed.</p>
<p>"I know how much you love her."</p>
<p>"You couldn't."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I could. It's on your face, John."
We drank without saying anything for a little while. The 
<i>maitre d'</i> came bearing menus and Roger waved him away with 
barely a look.</p>
<p>"I have been married three times and divorced three 
times," he said. "It didn't get better, or easier. It actually 
seemed to get worse, like bumping the same sore place time 
after time. The J. Geils Band was right. Love stinks." His new 
drink came and he sipped it. I half&#8212;expected him to say <i>Women! 
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em!</i>, but he didn't.</p>
<p>"Women," I said, beginning to feel like a figment of my own 
imagination. "Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em."</p>
<p>"Oh yes you can," he said, and although his eyes were on me he 
was quite clearly looking somewhere else. "You can live 
without 'em quite easily. But life without a woman, even if 
she's a shrew and a nag, sours a man. It turns an essential part 
of his soul into a pimple."</p>
<p>"Roger&#8212;"</p>
<p>He held up one hand. "You may not believe it, but we're 
almost done talking about this," he said. "We may get drunk 
and maudlin and run our gums on the subject, but we'll only be 
talking about how we've got a skinful, which is the only subject 
drunks ever talk about, really. I just want to tell you that I'm 
sincerely sorry Ruth has left you, and I am sorry for your pain. 
I'd share it if I could."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Roger," I said, my voice a little hoarse. For a 
second there were three or four Rogers sitting across the table 
from me and I had to wipe my eyes. "Thanks a lot."</p>
<p>"You're welcome." He took a sip of his drink. "For the 
moment let us leave what I'm helpless to reverse or alleviate 
and talk about your future. John, I want you to stay with Zenith 
House, at least until June. Maybe until the end of the year, but 
at least until June."</p>
<p>"I can't," I said. "If I stayed I'd just be another millstone 
around your neck, and I think you've got enough of those 
already."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be happy to see you go either time," he said 
as if he hadn't heard. He had taken the cigarette case he 
carried&#8212;it was too old and scratched and beaten to seem like 
an affectation&#8212;from his inside jacket pocket and was selecting 
a Kent from among what appeared to be several plump joints. 
"But I could let you go in June if we look like we're getting on 
our feet. If Enders swings the axe, I'd like you to stay on until 
the end of the year and help me wind things up in orderly 
fashion." He looked at me with something in his eyes that was 
very close to naked pleading. "Except for me, you're the only 
sane person <i>at</i> Zenith House. Oh, I guess none of them are as 
crazy as General Hecksler&#8212;although sometimes I wonder 
about Riddley&#8212;but it's only a matter of degree. I'm asking you 
not to leave me alone in this purgatory, and that's what Zenith 
House is this year."</p>
<p>"Roger, if I could&#8212;if I&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Have you made plans, then?"</p>
<p>"No...not exactly...but&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Not planning to go out and confront her, in spite of what 
this letter says?" He tapped it with a fingernail and then lighted 
his cigarette.</p>
<p>"No." The idea had certainly crossed my mind, but I 
didn't need Ruth to tell me it was a bad idea. In a movie the girl 
might suddenly realize her mistake when she saw the hero of 
her life standing before her, one hastily packed bag in his hand, 
shoulders drooping and his face tired from the transcontinental 
flight on the redeye, but in real life I would only turn her 
against me completely and forever or provoke some sort of 
extreme guilt reaction. And I might very well provoke an 
extreme pugilistic reaction in Mr. Toby Anderson, whose name 
I have already come to cordially hate. And although I have 
never seen him (the only thing she forgot to include, the jilted 
lover said bitterly, was a picture of my replacement), I keep 
picturing a young cleft&#8212;chinned man, very big, who looks, in 
my imagination at least, as if he belongs in a Los Angeles Rams 
uniform. I have no problem with landing in traction for my 
beloved&#8212;there is, in fact, a masochistic part of me which 
would probably welcome it&#8212;but I would be embarrassed, and I 
might cry. It disgusts me to admit  it, but I cry rather easily.</p>
<p>Roger was watching me closely but not saying anything, 
merely twiddling the stem of his drink glass.</p>
<p>And there was something else, wasn't there? Or maybe it 
was really the only thing, and the others are just 
rationalizations. In the last couple of months I've gotten a big 
dose of craziness. Not just the occasional bag&#8212;lady who rails at 
you on the street or the drunks in bars who want to tell you all 
about the nifty new betting systems with which they mean to 
take Atlantic City by storm, but real sicko craziness. And being 
exposed to that is like standing in front of the open door of a 
furnace in which a lot of very smelly garbage is being burned.</p>
<p>Could I be driven into a rage at seeing them together, her 
new fella&#8212;he of the odious football&#8212;player name&#8212;maybe 
stroking her ass with the blasé unconcern of acknowledged 
ownership? Me, John Kenton, graduate of Brown and president 
of the blah&#8212;blah&#8212;blah? Bespectacled John Kenton? Could I 
perhaps even be driven to some really irrevocable act&#8212;an act 
that might be more likely if he did in fact turn out to be as big 
as his odious name suggests? Shrieky old John Kenton, who 
mistook a bunch of special effects for genuine snuff photos?</p>
<p>The answer is, I don't know. But I know this: I awoke 
from a terrible dream last night, a dream in which I had just 
thrown battery acid into her face. That was what really scared 
me, scared me so badly I had to sleep the rest of the night with 
the light on.</p>
<p>Not his.</p>
<p><i>Hers</i>.</p>
<p>Ruth's face.</p>
<p>"No," I said again, and then poured the rest of my drink 
over the dryness I heard in my voice. "No, I think that would be 
very unwise."</p>
<p>"Then you <i>could</i> stay on."</p>
<p>"Yes, but I couldn't <i>work</i>." I looked at him with some 
exasperation. My head was starting to buzz. It wasn't a very 
cheerful buzz, but all the same I signaled the waiter, who had 
been lurking nearby, for another. "Right now I'm having 
trouble remembering how to tie my own shoelaces." No. 
Wrong. That was hip and it sounded good, but it wasn't the 
truth&#8212;my shoelaces had nothing to do with it. "Roger, I'm 
depressed."</p>
<p>"Bereaved people shouldn't sell the house after the 
funeral," Roger said, and in my state of buzziness that seemed 
extremely witty&#8212;worthy of H. L. Mencken, in fact. I laughed.
Roger smiled, but I could tell he was serious. "It's true," he 
said. "One of the few interesting courses I ever took in college 
was called the Psychology of Human Stress&#8212;one of these nifty 
little blocks they give you to fill up the final eight weeks of 
your senior year after you're done student teaching&#8212;"</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> were going to be a teacher?" I asked startled. I 
couldn't see Roger teaching&#8212;and then, all of a sudden I could.</p>
<p>"I <i>did</i> teach for six years," Roger said. "Four in high 
school and two in elementary. But that's beside the point. This 
course took up human stress situations like marriage, divorce, 
imprisonment, and bereavement. The course wasn't really a 
Signposts for Better Living sort of deal, but if you kept your 
eyes open you couldn't help but notice a few. One was this 
thing about living out at least the first six months of a really 
deep bereavement in the house where you and your loved one 
were living when the death occurred."</p>
<p>"Roger, this is not the same thing." I sipped my new 
drink, which tasted just like my old drink. It occurred to me that 
I was getting fried. It also occurred to me that I didn't care in 
the slightest.</p>
<p>"But it <i>is</i>," He said, leaning solemnly toward me. "In a 
queer way Ruth is dead to you now. You may see her from time 
to time over the years, but if the break is as final and complete 
as that letter sounds, the Ruth we could call your Lover&#8212;Ruth is 
dead to you. And you are grieving."</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to tell him he was full of shit, and 
then I closed it again because he was at least partly right. That's 
what carrying a torch really means, isn't it? You're grieving for 
the lover who died&#8212;the lover who is dead to you, anyway.</p>
<p>"People tend to think of 'grief' and 'depression' as 
interchangeable terms," Roger said. His tone was a good deal 
more pedantic than usual, and his eyes were rimmed with red. It 
occurred to me that Roger was getting fried, too. "They're 
really not. There's an element of depression in grief, of course, 
but there are a whole slew of other feelings as well, ranging 
from guilt and sadness to anger and relief. A person who runs 
from the scene of those feelings is a person in retreat from the 
inevitable. He arrives in a new place and discovers he feels 
exactly the same mixture of emotions we call grief&#8212;except 
now he feels homesickness as well, and a feeling of having lost 
the essential linkage which eventually turn grief into 
remembrance."</p>
<p>"You remember all of that from an eight&#8212;week 
psychology block course you took eighteen years ago?"
Roger sipped modestly at his drink. "Sure," he said. "I got an 
A."</p>
<p>"Bullshit you do."</p>
<p>"I also banged the grad student who taught the course. 
What a piece of ass <i>she</i> was."</p>
<p>"It's not my <i>apartment</i> I was planning to leave," I said, 
although I had no idea if I intended to leave it or not...and I 
know that wasn't his point anyway.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't matter whether you left that two&#8212;room 
cockroach condo or not," he said. "You know what I'm talking 
about here. Your <i>job</i> is your house."</p>
<p>"Yeah? Well the roof is sure leaking," I said, and even 
<i>that</i> seemed sort of witty to me. I was getting fried, all right.</p>
<p>"I want you to help me fix the leak, John," he said, 
leaning forward earnestly. "That's what I'm saying. That's why 
I asked you out tonight. And your agreement is the only thing 
capable of mitigating what is undoubtedly going to be one of 
the most beastly hangovers of my life. Help us both. Stay on."</p>
<p>"You'll pardon me if all of this sounds just a little bit 
self&#8212;serving and fortuitous."</p>
<p>He sat back. "I respect you," he said a trifle coldly, "but I 
also like you, John. If I didn't I wouldn't be breaking my ass to 
keep you on." He hesitated, seemed on the point of saying 
something more, then didn't. His eyes said it for him: <i>And 
humiliating myself by damn' near begging</i>.</p>
<p>"I just don't understand why you're trying so hard," I 
said. "I mean, I'm flattered, but&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Because if anyone can bring in a book or create an idea 
that will keep Zenith from going belly&#8212;up, it's you," he said. 
There was an intensity in his eyes I found almost frightening. "I 
know how fucking embarrassed you were by the whole 
Detweiller business, but&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Please," I said. "Let's not add insult to injury."</p>
<p>"I had no intention of even bringing it up," he said. "It's 
just that your very openness to such an off&#8212;the&#8212;wall 
proposition&#8212;"</p>
<p>"It was off the wall, all right&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Will you shut up and <i>listen</i>? Your response to the 
Detweiller query showed you're still alive to a potentially 
commercial idea. Herb or Bill would simply have dropped his 
letter in the circular file."</p>
<p>"And we all would have been a lot better off," I said, but 
I saw where he was going and would be lying if I didn't say I 
was flattered...and that I felt a little better about the Detweiller 
affair for the first time since my humiliation at the police 
station.</p>
<p>"<i>This</i> time," he agreed. "But those guys <i>also</i> would have 
turned down V. C. Andrews with her <i>Toys in the Attic</i> series, or 
some brand new idea. Boom, into the circular file and then back 
to contemplating their navels." He paused. "I need you, Johnny, 
and I think it would be good if you stayed&#8212;for you, for me, for 
Zenith. There's no other way I can put it. Think it over and give 
me your answer. I'll accept it either way."</p>
<p>"You'd be paying me for the equivalent of cutting out 
paper dolls, Roger."</p>
<p>"That's a chance I'm willing to take."</p>
<p>I thought about it. I'd started to clean out my desk that 
day and hadn't gotten very far&#8212;to paraphrase Poe, who would 
have thought the old desk could have had so much crap in it? 
Or maybe it was just me, and that crack about not even being 
able to tie my own shoelaces wasn't so wrong, after all. I'd 
gotten two empty cardboard cartons from Riddley's room 
(which smells oddly green lately, like fresh marijuana&#8212;and no, 
I didn't see any) and did nothing but stare from one to the other. 
Maybe with a little more time I could at least complete the 
elementary job of cleaning up my old life before starting some 
unimaginable new one. It's just that I've felt so fucking <i>dreary</i>.
"Suppose we table the resignation until the end of the month," I 
said. "would that ease your mind?"</p>
<p>He smiled. "It's not the best I'd hoped for," he said, "but 
it's not the worst I was afraid of, either. I'll take it. And now I 
think we better order while we can still sit up straight."</p>
<p>We ordered steaks, and ate them, but by then my mouth 
was too numb to taste much. I suppose I just ought to be 
grateful that no one had to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on 
either of us.</p>
<p>As we were leaving&#8212;holding onto each other, assisted 
by the anxious <i>maitre d'</i> (who no doubt only wanted to get us 
the fuck out of there before we broke something), Roger told 
me: "Something else I learned in that psychology course&#8212;"</p>
<p>"What did you say they called it? The Psychology of 
Damaged Souls?"</p>
<p>We were outside by then, and his cackles drifted away in 
little frosty plumes of vapor. "It was the Psychology of Human 
Stress, but I actually like yours better." Roger energetically 
flagged down a cab, whose driver would shortly be very sorry 
he picked us up. "It also said that it helps to keep a diary."</p>
<p>"Shit," I said. "I haven't kept a diary since I was eleven."</p>
<p>"Well what the hell," he said. "<i>look</i> for it, John. Maybe 
it's still around somewhere." And he went off into another wild 
run of cackles which only ended when he leaned over and 
puked nonchalantly on his own shoes.</p>
<p>He did it twice more on the way to his apartment building 
at 20th and Park Avenue South, leaning as far out the window as 
he could (which wasn't too far since it was one of those 
Plymouths where the rear windows will only roll down about 
halfway and there's a grim little yellow and black sign that says 
DO NOT FORCE THE WINDOW!) and just sort of blowing it 
into the slipstream and then settling back with that same 
nonchalant expression on his face. Our driver, a Nigerian or 
Somalian by his accent, was horrified. He pulled over to the 
curb and ordered us out. I was willing, but Roger sat tight.</p>
<p>"My friend," he said, "I would get out if I could walk. 
Since I cannot, you must convey us hence."</p>
<p>"I want you out my caib, good sah."</p>
<p>"So far I have done you the courtesy of vomiting out the 
window," Roger said with that same nonchalant and rather 
pleasant expression on his face. "It hasn't been easy because of 
the angle, but I have done it. I think in another few seconds I 
am going to vomit again. If you don't convey us hence, I am 
going to do it in your ashtray."</p>
<p>At Roger's building I assisted him into the lobby and saw 
him into the elevator with his apartment key in his hand. Then I 
wove my way back to the cab.</p>
<p>"You git annoder cab, mon," the driver said. "You just 
pay me and git annoder. I don't want to no mo convey you 
hence."</p>
<p>"It's just down to Soho," I said, "and I'll give you a hell 
of a tip. Also, I don't feel like puking." This was a bit of a lie, 
I'm afraid.</p>
<p>He took me, and from the look of my wallet the next day 
I did indeed give him a hell of a tip. And I actually managed to 
make it upstairs before throwing up. Although once I started I 
didn't stop for quite awhile.</p>
<p>I didn't go in the next day&#8212;it was all I could do to get 
out of bed. My head felt monstrous, bloated. I called in around 
three and got Bill Gelb, who told me Roger hadn't shown, 
either.</p>
<p>Since then I have done a lot of crying and have had 
mostly sleepless nights, but perhaps Roger wasn't so wrong&#8212;
the only hours that I feel even halfway myself are the ones 
spent on the 9th floor at 490 Park. Riddley has just about had to 
sweep me out the door along with his red sawdust the last two 
nights. Maybe there is something to that old "he threw himself 
into his work" crap after all. Even this diary idea feels 
right...although it may only be the relief of finally being done 
with my dreadful pastoral novel.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll stay on after all. Onward and upward...if there 
is any upward left for me. Man, I still can't believe she's gone.
And I still haven't lost hope that she may change her mind.</p>

<br>
<p class="carloslettersalut">Dear Poop&#8212;Shit,</p>
<p>Did you think I had forgotten you? My plans for revenge 
will go forward no matter WHAT! happens to me! You and all 
your fellow "Pus&#8212;Bags" will soon feel the WRATH! of 
CARLOS!!</p>
<p>I have covened the powers of Hell,
</p>
<p class="carloslettersign">Carlos Detweiller<br>
In Transit, U.S.A.<br>
PS&#8212;Smell anything "<i>green</i>" yet, Mr. Poop&#8212;Shit Kenton?</p>
<p class="journalheader">From John Kenton's diary.</p>
<p class="letterdate">March 22, 1981</p>
<p>Had a letter from Carlos today. I laughed until I shrieked. 
Herb Porter came on the run, wanted to know if I was dying or 
what. I showed it to him. He read it and only frowned. He 
wanted to know what I was laughing about&#8212;didn't I take this 
Detweiller fellow seriously?</p>
<p>"Oh, I take him seriously...sort of," I said.</p>
<p>"Then why in hell are you laughing?"</p>
<p>"I guess I just must be a warped plank in the great floor 
of the universe," I said, and then went off into even madder 
gales of laughter.</p>
<p>Frowning so deeply now that the lines in his face had 
become crevasses, Herb laid the letter on the corner of my desk 
and then backed into the doorway, as if whatever I had might be 
catching. "I don't know why you're so weird lately," he said, 
"but I'll give you some good advice anyway. Get yourself some 
personal protection. And if you need psychiatric help, John&#8212;"
I just kept laughing&#8212;by then I'd worked myself into a semi&#8212;
hysterical frenzy. Herb stared at me a moment longer, then 
slammed the door and walked away. Just as well, really, as I 
finished by crying.</p>
<p>I expect to speak to Ruth tonight. By exercising all of my 
willpower I have managed to hold off on calling her, expecting 
each day that she must call me. Maddening images of her and 
the odious Toby Anderson cavorting together&#8212;the locale 
which keeps recurring is a hot&#8212;tub. So I'll call her. So much for 
willpower.</p>
<p>If I had a return address for Carlos Detweiller I think I'd 
drop him a postcard: "Dear Carlos&#8212;I know all about covening 
the powers of Hell. Your Ob'd Servant, Poop&#8212;Shit Kenton."</p>
<p>Why I bother to write all this crud down, or why I keep 
plowing through the stacks of old unreturned manuscripts in the 
mailroom next to Riddley's janitorial closet, are both mysteries 
to me.</p>
<div align="right"><p>March 23, 1981</p></div>
<p>My call to Ruth was an utter disaster. Why I should be 
sitting here and writing about it when I don't even want to <i>think</i>
about it defies reason. Perversity upon perversity. Actually, I <i>do</i> 
know&#8212;I have some dim idea that if I write it down it will lose 
some of its power over me...so let me by all means confess, but 
the less said, the better.</p>
<p>Have I written here that I cry very easily? I think so, but I 
haven't the heart to actually look back and see. Well, I cried. 
Maybe that says it all. Or maybe it doesn't. I guess it doesn't. I 
had spent the day&#8212;the last two or three days, actually&#8212;telling 
myself that I would not a.) cry, or b.) beg her to come back. I 
ended up doing c.) both. I've had a lot of gruff locker room 
chats with myself over the last couple of days (and mostly 
sleepless nights) on the subject of Pride. As in, "Even after 
everything else is gone, a man's got his Pride." I would draw 
some lonely comfort from this thought and fantasize myself as 
Paul Newman&#8212;that scene in <i>Cool Hand Luke</i> where he sits in 
his cell after his mother's death, playing his banjo and crying 
soundlessly. Heart&#8212;rending, but cool, definitely cool.</p>
<p>Well, my cool lasted just about four minutes after hearing 
her voice and having a sudden total remembrance of Ruth&#8212;
something like an imagistic tattoo. What I'm saying is that I 
didn't know how gone she was until I heard her say "Hello? 
John?"&#8212;just those two words&#8212;and had this searing 360 degree 
memory of Ruth&#8212;God, how here she was when she was here!</p>
<p>Even after everything else is gone, a man's got his Pride? 
Samson might have had similar sentiments about his hair.</p>
<p>Anyway, I cried and I begged and after a little while <i>she</i> 
cried and in the end she had to hang up to get rid of me. Or 
maybe the odious Toby&#8212;I never heard him but am somehow 
sure he was in the room with her; I could almost smell his Brut 
cologne&#8212;picked the phone out of her hand and did her hanging 
up for her. So they could discuss his love&#8212;ring, or their June 
wedding, or perhaps so he could mingle his tears with hers. 
Bitter&#8212;bitter&#8212;I know. But I've discovered that even after 
Pride has gone, a man's got his Bitterness.</p>
<p>Did I discover anything else this evening? Yes, I think 
so. That it is over&#8212;genuinely and completely over. Will this 
stop me from calling her again and debasing myself even 
further (if that is possible)? I don't know. I hope so&#8212;God, I do. 
And there's always the possibility that she'll change her phone 
number. In fact, I think that's even a probability, given 
tonight's festivities.</p>
<p>So what is there for me now? Work, I guess&#8212;work, 
work, and more work. I'm tunneling my way steadily into the 
logjam of manuscripts in the mailroom&#8212;unsolicited scripts 
which were never returned, for one reason or another (after all, 
it says right in the boiler&#8212;plate that we accept no responsibility 
for such orphan children). I don't really expect to find the next 
<i>Flowers in the Attic</i> in there, or a budding John Saul or 
Rosemary Rogers, but if Roger was wrong about that, he was 
sublimely right about something much more important&#8212;the 
work is keeping me sane.</p>
<p>Pride...then Bitterness...then Work.</p>
<p>Oh, fuck it. I'm going to go out, buy myself a bottle of 
bourbon, and get shitty&#8212;ass drunk. This is John Kenton, signing 
off and going for the long bomb.
