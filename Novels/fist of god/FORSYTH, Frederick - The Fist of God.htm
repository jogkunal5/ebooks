<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i><span
style='font-size:16.0pt'>THE FIST OF GOD</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“ ‘The man with ten minutes to live was laughing.’ So
begins Frederick Forsyth’s <i>The Fist of God</i>—and even with just that one
line you can see that he has returned to the pulse-pounding form of such books
as <i>The Day of the Jackal </i>and <i>The Dogs of War</i>. Forsyth has written
perhaps the first true thriller to come out of the Gulf War.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>—<i>Book-of-the-Month
Club News</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“[A] fat, layered, complex, and altogether sublime spy
action novel ... <i>The Fist of God </i>is delicious yet authentic fun, the
stuff of good espionage thrillers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>—<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“The Gulf War is the setting of Forsyth’s brilliantly
plotted ‘what if’ thriller in which historical facts are turned into gripping
fiction. ... It’s the mark of master Forsyth that characters and background
information are introduced so cleanly and precisely that impossibly complex
events are never confusing, and the story develops its grip so surely it’s
almost impossible to put the book down.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>—<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“The novel ends in a blaze of top-notch military action,
finely wrought descriptions of the gadgetry of destruction, and a twisty
revelation. ... Super sleuthing.”</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942752">Chapter 1</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The man with ten minutes to live was laughing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The source of his amusement was a story just
told him by his personal aide, Monique Jaminé, who was driving him home that
chill, drizzling evening of March 22, 1990, from his office to his apartment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It concerned a mutual colleague in the Space
Research Corporation offices at rue de Stalle, a woman regarded as a real vamp,
a man-eater, who had turned out to be gay. The deception appealed to the man’s
lavatorial sense of humor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pair had left the offices in the Brussels
suburb of Uccle, Belgium, at ten to seven, Monique driving the Renault 21
estate wagon. She had, some months earlier, sold her employer’s own Volkswagen
because he was such a rotten driver, she feared he would end up killing
himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was only a ten-minute drive from the offices
to his apartment in the center building of the three-building Cheridreu complex
off rue François Folie, but they stopped halfway there at a baker’s shop. Both
went inside, he to buy a loaf of his favorite <i>pain de campagne</i>. There
was rain in the wind; they bowed their heads, failing to notice the car that
followed behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nothing strange in that. Neither was trained in
tradecraft; the unmarked car with its two dark-jowled occupants had been
following the scientist for weeks, never losing him, never approaching him,
just watching; and he had not seen them. Others had, but he did not know.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Emerging from the shop just in front of the
cemetery, he tossed his loaf into the back seat and climbed aboard to complete
the journey to his home. At ten minutes after seven, Monique drew up in front
of the plate-glass doors of the apartment building, set fifteen meters back
from the street. She offered to come up with him, to see him home, but he
declined. She knew he would be expecting his girlfriend Helene and did not wish
them to meet. It was one of his vanities, in which his adoring female staff
indulged him, that Helene was just a good friend, keeping him company while he
was in Brussels and his wife was in Canada.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He climbed out of the car, the collar of his
belted trench coat turned up as ever, and hefted onto his shoulder the big
black canvas bag that hardly ever left him. It weighed over fifteen kilograms
and contained a mass of papers: scientific papers, projects, calculations, and
data. The scientist distrusted safes and thought illogically that all the
details of his latest projects were safer hanging from his shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The last Monique saw of her employer, he was
standing in front of the glass doors, his bag over one shoulder, the loaf under
the other arm, fumbling for his keys. She watched him go through the doors and
the self-locking plate glass swing closed behind him. Then she drove off.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The scientist lived on the sixth floor of the
eight-story building. Two elevators ran up the back wall of the building,
encircled by the stairs, with a fire door on each landing. He took one of them
and stepped out at the sixth floor. The dim, floor-level lights of the lobby
came on automatically as he did so. Still jangling his keys, leaning against
the weight of his bag, and clutching his loaf, he turned left and left again
across the russet-brown carpet and tried to fit his key into the lock of his
apartment door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The killer had been waiting on the other side
of the elevator shaft, which jutted into the dimly lit lobby. He came quietly
around the shaft holding his silenced 7.65-mm. Beretta automatic, which was
wrapped in a plastic bag to prevent the ejected cartridges from spilling all
over the carpet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Five shots, fired from less than a one-meter
range into the back of the head and neck, were more than enough. The big, burly
man slumped forward against his door and slithered to the carpet. The gunman
did not bother to check; there was no need. He had done this before, practicing
on prisoners, and he knew his work was done. He ran lightly down the six
flights of stairs, out of the back of the building, across the tree-studded
gardens, and into the waiting car. In an hour he was inside his country’s
embassy, in a day out of Belgium.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Helene arrived five minutes later. At first she
thought her lover had had a heart attack. In a panic she let herself in and
called the paramedics. Then she realized his own doctor lived in the same
building, and she summoned him as well. The paramedics arrived first.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of them tried to shift the heavy body,
still facing downward. The man’s hand came away covered in blood. Minutes
later, he and the doctor pronounced the victim quite dead. The only other
occupant of the four flats on that floor came to her door, an elderly lady who
had been listening to a classical concert and heard nothing behind her solid
timber door. Cheridreu was that kind of building, very discreet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man lying on the floor was Dr. Gerald
Vincent Bull, wayward genius, gun designer to the world, and more latterly
armorer for Saddam Hussein of Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the aftermath of the murder of Dr. Gerry Bull, some
strange things began to happen all over Europe. In Brussels, Belgian
counterintelligence admitted that for some months Bull had been followed on an
almost daily basis by a series of unmarked cars containing two men of swarthy,
eastern Mediterranean appearance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On April 11, British Customs officers seized on
the docks of Middlesborough eight sections of huge steel pipes, beautifully
forged and milled and able to be assembled by giant flanges at each end,
drilled to take powerful nuts and bolts. The triumphant officers announced that
these tubes were not intended for a petrochemical plant, as specified on the
bills of lading and the export certificates, but were parts of a great gun
barrel designed by Gerry Bull and destined for Iraq. The farce of the Supergun
was born, and it would run and run, revealing double-dealing, the stealthy paws
of several intelligence agencies, a mass of bureaucratic ineptitude, and some
political chicanery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within weeks, bits of the Supergun began
popping up all over Europe. On April 23, Turkey announced it had stopped a
Hungarian truck carrying a single ten-meter steel tube for Iraq, believed to be
part of the gun. The same day, Greek officials seized another truck with steel
parts and held the hapless British driver for several weeks as an accomplice.
In May the Italians intercepted seventy-five tons of parts, while a further
fifteen tons were confiscated at the Fucine works, near Rome. The latter were
of a titanium steel alloy and destined to be part of the breech of the gun, as
were more bits and pieces yielded by a warehouse at Brescia, in northern Italy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Germans came in, with discoveries at
Frankfurt and Bremerhaven, also identified as parts of the by now world-famous
Supergun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In fact, Gerry Bull had placed the orders for
his brainchild skillfully and well. The tubes forming the barrels were indeed
made in England by two firms, Walter Somers of Birmingham and Sheffield
Forgemasters. But the eight intercepted in April 1990 were the last of
fifty-two sections, enough to make two complete barrels 156 meters long and
with an unbelievable one-meter caliber, capable of firing a projectile the size
of a cylindrical telephone booth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The trunnions or supports came from Greece, the
pipes, pumps, and valves that formed the recoil mechanism from Switzerland and
Italy, the breech block from Austria and Germany, the propellant from Belgium.
In all, seven countries were involved as contractors, and none knew quite what
they were making.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The popular press had a field day, as did the
exultant customs officers and the British legal system, which began eagerly
prosecuting any innocent party involved. What no one pointed out was that the
horse had bolted. The intercepted parts constituted Superguns 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As for the killing of Gerry Bull, it produced
some weird theories in the media. Predictably, the CIA was nominated by the
CIA-is-responsible-for-everything brigade. This was another absurdity. Although
Langley has, in the past and under particular circumstances, countenanced the
elimination of certain parties, these parties have almost always been in the
same business—contract officers turned sour, renegades, and double agents. The
notion that the lobby at Langley is choked with the corpses of former agents
gunned down by their own colleagues at the behest of genocidal directors on the
top floor is amusing but wholly unreal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Moreover, Gerry Bull was not from that
back-alley world. He was a well-known scientist, designer, and contractor of
artillery, conventional and very unconventional, an American citizen who had
once worked for America for years and talked copiously to his U.S. Army friends
about what he was up to. If every designer and industrialist in the weapons
industry who was working for a country not at that time seen to be an enemy of
the United States was to be “wasted,” some five hundred individuals across
North and South America and Europe would have to qualify.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, Langley has for at least the past ten
years become gridlocked by the new bureaucracy of controls and oversight
committees. No professional intelligence officer is going to order a hit
without a written and signed order. For a man like Gerry Bull, that signature
would have to come from the Director of Central Intelligence himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The DCI at that time was William Webster, a
by-the-book former judge from Kansas. It would be about as easy to get a signed
hit authority out of William Webster as to burrow a way out of the Marion
penitentiary with a blunt teaspoon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But far and away the league leader in the
who-killed-Gerry-Bull enigma was, of course, the Israeli Mossad. The entire
press and most of Bull’s friends and family jumped to the same conclusion. Bull
had been working for Iraq; Iraq was the enemy of Israel; two and two equals
four. The trouble is, in that world of shadows and distorting mirrors, what may
or may not appear to be two, when multiplied by a factor that may or may not be
two, could possibly come out at four but probably will not.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Mossad is the world’s smallest, most
ruthless, and most gung-ho of the leading intelligence agencies. It has in the
past undoubtedly undertaken many assassinations, using one of the three <i>kidon</i>
teams—the word is the Hebrew for bayonet. The <i>kidonim </i>come under the
Combatants or Komemiute Division, the deep-cover men, the hard squad. But even
the Mossad has its rules, albeit self-imposed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terminations fall into two categories. One is “operational
requirement,” an unforeseen emergency in which an operation involving friendly
lives is put at risk by someone, and the person in the way has to be eased out
of the way, fast and permanently. In these cases, the supervising <i>katsa</i>,
or case officer, has the right to waste the opponent who is jeopardizing the
entire mission, and will get retroactive support from his bosses back in Tel
Aviv.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other category of terminations is for those
already on the execution list. This list exists in two places: the private safe
of the Prime Minister and the safe of the head of the Mossad. Every incoming
Prime Minister is required to see this list, which may contain between thirty
and eighty names. He may initial each name, giving the Mossad the go-ahead on
an if-and-when basis, or he may insist on being consulted before each new
mission. In either event, he must sign the execution order.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Broadly speaking, those on the list fall into
three classes. There are a few remaining top Nazis, though this class has
almost ceased to exist. Years ago, although Israel mounted a major operation to
kidnap and try Adolf Eichmann because it wanted to make an international
example of him, other Nazis were simply liquidated quietly. Class two are
almost all contemporary terrorists, mainly Arabs who have already shed Israeli
or Jewish blood like Ahmed Jibril and Abu Nidal, or who would like to, with a
few non-Arabs thrown in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Class three, which might have contained the
name of Gerry Bull, are those working for Israel’s enemies and whose work will
carry great danger for Israel and her citizens if it progresses any further.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The common denominator is that those targeted
must have blood on their hands, either in fact or in prospect.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If a hit is requested, the Prime Minister will
pass the matter to a judicial investigator so secret, few Israeli jurists and
no citizens have ever heard of him. The investigator holds a “court,” with the
charge read out, a prosecutor, and a defender. If the Mossad’s request is
confirmed, the matter goes back to the Prime Minister for his signature. The <i>kidon</i>
team does the rest—if it can.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The problem with the Mossad-killed-Bull theory
is that it is flawed at almost every level. True, Bull was working for Saddam
Hussein, designing new conventional artillery (which could not reach Israel), a
rocket program (which might, one day), and a giant gun (which did not worry
Israel at all). But so were hundreds of others. Half a dozen German firms were
behind Iraq’s hideous poison gas industry, with whose products Saddam had
already threatened Israel. Germans and Brazilians were working flat-out on the
rockets of Saad 16. The French were the prime movers and suppliers of the Iraqi
research for a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That Bull, his ideas, his designs, his
activities, and his progress deeply interested Israel, there is no doubt. In
the aftermath of his death much was made of the fact that in the preceding
months he had been worried by repeated covert entries into his flat while he
was away. Nothing had ever been taken, but traces had been left. Glasses were
moved and replaced; windows were left open; a videotape was rewound and removed
from the player. Was he being warned, he wondered, and was the Mossad behind it
all? He was, and they were—but for a less-than-obvious reason.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the aftermath, the black-jowled strangers
with the guttural accents who tailed him all over Brussels were identified by
the media as Israeli assassins preparing their moment. Unfortunately for the
theory, Mossad agents do not run around looking and acting like Pancho Villa.
They were there, all right, but nobody saw them; not Bull, not his friends or
family, not the Belgian police. They were in Brussels with a team who could
look like and pass for Europeans—Belgians, Americans, whatever they chose. It
was they who tipped off the Belgians that Bull was being followed by another
team.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Moreover, Gerry Bull was a man of extraordinary
indiscretion. He simply could not resist a challenge. He had worked for Israel
before, liked the country and the people, had many friends in the Israeli Army,
and could not keep his mouth shut. Challenged with a phrase like: “Gerry, I bet
you’ll never get those rockets at Saad 16 to work,” Bull would leap into a
three-hour monologue describing exactly what he was doing, how far the project
had got, what were the problems, and how he hoped to solve them—the lot. For an
intelligence service, he was a dream of indiscretion. Even in the last week of
his life he was entertaining two Israeli generals at his office, giving them a
complete up-to-the-minute picture, all tape-recorded by the devices in their
briefcases. Why would they destroy such a cornucopia of inside information?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, the Mossad has one other habit when
dealing with a scientist or industrialist, but never with a terrorist. A final
warning is always given; not a weird break-in aimed at moving glasses or rewinding
videotapes, but an actual verbal warning. Even with Dr. Yahia El Meshad, the
Egyptian nuclear physicist who worked on the first Iraqi nuclear reactor and
was assassinated in his room at the Meridien Hotel in Paris on June 13, 1980,
the procedure was observed. An Arabic-speaking <i>katsa</i> went to his room
and told him bluntly what would happen to him if he did not desist. The
Egyptian told the stranger at his door to get lost—not a wise move. Telling a
Mossad <i>kidon</i> team to perform an impractical act upon themselves is not a
tactic approved by the insurance industry. Two hours later, Meshad was dead.
But he had had his chance. A year later, the whole French-supplied nuclear
complex at Osirak 1 and 2 was blown away by an Israeli air strike.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull was different—a Canadian-born American
citizen, genial, approachable, and a whiskey drinker of awesome talent. The
Israelis could talk to him as a friend, and did constantly. It would have been
the easiest thing in the world to send a friend to tell him bluntly that he had
got to stop or the hard squad would come after him—nothing personal, Gerry,
just the way things are.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull was not in the business of winning a
posthumous Congressional Medal. Moreover, he had already told the Israelis and
his close friend George Wong that he wanted out of Iraq—physically and
contractually. He had had enough. What happened to Dr. Gerry Bull was something
quite different.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Gerald Vincent Bull was born in 1928 at North Bay,
Ontario. At school he was clever and driven by an urge to succeed and earn the
world’s approval. At sixteen he graduated from high school, but because he was
so young the only college that would accept him was the University of Toronto
Engineering Faculty. Here he showed he was not just clever but brilliant. At
twenty-two he became the youngest-ever Ph.D. It was aeronautical engineering
that seized his imagination, specifically ballistics—the study of bodies,
whether projectiles or rockets, in flight. It was this that led him down the
road to artillery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After Toronto, he joined the Canadian Armament
and Research Development Establishment, CARDE, at Valcartier, a then quiet
little township outside Quebec City. In the early 1950s man was turning his
face not only toward the skies but beyond them to space itself. The buzzword
was <i>rockets</i>. It was then that Bull showed he was something apart from
technically brilliant. He was a maverick—inventive, unconventional, and
imaginative. It was during his ten years at CARDE that he developed his idea,
which would become his life’s dream for the rest of his days.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Like all new ideas, Bull’s appeared quite
simple. When he looked at the emerging range of American rockets in the late
1950s, he realized that nine-tenths of these then impressive-looking rockets
were only the first stage. Sitting right on top, only a fraction of the size,
were the second and third stages and, even smaller, the tiny nipple of the
payload.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The giant first stage was intended to lift the
rocket up through the first 150 kilometers of air, where the atmosphere was thickest
and gravity strongest. After the 150-kilometer mark, it needed much less power
to drive the satellite on into space itself, and into orbit at between 400 and
500 kilometers above the earth. Every time a rocket went up, the whole of that
bulky and very expensive first stage was destroyed—burned out, to fall forever
into the oceans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Supposing, Bull mused, you could punch your
second and third stages, plus the payload, up those first ISO kilometers from
the barrel of a giant gun? In theory, he pleaded with the money men, it was
possible, easier, and cheaper, and the gun could be used over and over again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was his first real brush with politicians
and bureaucrats, and he failed, mainly because of his personality. He hated
them, and they hated him. But in 1961 he got lucky. McGill University came in
because it foresaw some interesting publicity. The U.S. Army came in for
reasons of its own; guardian of American artillery, the Army was in a power
play with the Air Force, which was battling for control over all rockets or
projectiles going above 100 kilometers. With their combined funds, Bull was
able to set up a small research establishment on the island of Barbados. The
Army let him have a package of one out-of-storage sixteen-inch Navy gun (the
biggest caliber in the world), one spare barrel, one small radar tracking unit,
a crane, and some trucks. McGill set up a metal workshop. It was like trying to
take on the Grand Prix racing industry with the facilities of a back-street
garage. But Bull did it. His career of amazing inventions had begun, and he was
thirty-three years old: shy, diffident, untidy, inventive, and still a
maverick.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He called his research in Barbados the High
Altitude Research Project, or HARP. The old Navy gun was duly erected, and Bull
began work on projectiles. He called them Martlet, after the heraldic bird that
appears on the insignia of McGill University.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull wanted to put a payload of instruments
into earth orbit cheaper and faster than anyone else. He knew perfectly well
that no human could withstand the pressures of being fired from a gun, but he
figured rightly that in the future ninety percent of scientific research and
work in space would be done by machines, not men. America under Kennedy, goaded
by the flight of the Russian Yuri Gagarin, pursued from Cape Canaveral the more
glamorous but ultimately rather pointless exercise of putting mice, dogs,
monkeys, and eventually men up there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Down in Barbados, Bull soldiered on with his
single gun and his Martlet projectiles. In 1964 he blew a Martlet 92 kilometers
high, then added an extra 16 meters of barrel to his gun (it cost just
$41,000), making the new 36-meter barrel the longest in the world. With this,
he reached the magic 150 kilometers with a 180-kilogram payload.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He solved the problems as they arose. A major
one was the propellant. In a small gun the charge gives the projectile a single
hard smack as it expands from solid to gas in a microsecond. The gas tries to
escape its compression and has nowhere to go but out of the barrel, pushing the
shell ahead of it as it does so. But with a barrel as long as Bull’s, a
special, slower-burning propellant was needed not to split the barrel wide
open. He needed a powder that would send his projectile up this enormous barrel
in a long, steadily accelerating <i>whoosh</i>. So he designed it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In 1966, Bull’s old adversaries among the
Canadian Defense Ministry bureaucrats got him by urging their minister to pull
his financing. Bull protested that he could put a payload of instruments into
space for a fraction of what it cost Cape Canaveral. To no avail. To protect
its interest, the U.S. Army transferred Bull from Barbados to Yuma, Arizona.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Here, in November of that year, he put a
payload 180 kilometers up, a record that stood for twenty-five years. But in
1967, Canada pulled out completely, both the government and McGill University.
The U.S. Army followed suit. The HARP project closed down. Bull set himself up
on a purely consultative basis at an estate he had bought at Highwater that
straddled the border of northern Vermont and his native Canada. He called his
company Space Research Corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were two postscripts to the HARP affair.
By 1990, it was costing ten thousand dollars to put every kilogram of
instruments into space in the Space Shuttle program out of Cape Canaveral. To
his dying day, Bull knew he could do it for six hundred dollars per kilo. And
in 1988 work began on a new project at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in California. The project involved a giant gun, but so far with a barrel only
four inches in caliber and a barrel only fifty meters long. Eventually, and at
a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, it is hoped that a much, much bigger
one will be built, with a view to firing payloads into space. The project’s
name is Super-High Altitude Research Project, or SHARP.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Gerry Bull lived in and ran his complex at Highwater on
the border for ten years. In that time he dropped his unfulfilled dream of a
gun that would fire payloads into space and concentrated on his second area of
expertise—the more profitable one of conventional artillery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He began with the major problem: Almost all the
world’s armies based their artillery on the universal 155-mm. howitzer field
gun. Bull knew that in an artillery exchange, the man with the longer range is
king. He can sit back and blow the enemy away while remaining inviolate. Bull
was determined to extend the range and increase the accuracy of the 155-mm.
field gun. He started with the ammunition. It had been tried before, but no one
had succeeded. In four years Bull cracked it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In control tests the Bull shell went one and a
half times the distance as the same 155-mm. standard gun, was more accurate,
and exploded with the same force into 4,700 fragments, as opposed to 1,350 for
a NATO shell. NATO was not interested. By the grace of God, neither was the
Soviet Union.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Undeterred, Bull plowed on, producing a new
full-bore extended-range shell. Still NATO was not interested, preferring to
stay with its traditional suppliers and the short-range shell.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But if the powers would not look, the rest of the
world did. Military delegations swarmed to Highwater to consult Gerry Bull.
They included Israel (this was when he cemented friendships begun with
observers in Barbados), Egypt, Venezuela, Chile, and Iran. He also acted as a
consultant on other artillery matters to Britain, Holland, Italy, Canada, and the
United States, whose military scientists (if not the Pentagon) continued to
study with some awe what he was up to.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In 1972, Bull was quietly made a U.S. citizen.
The next year, he began work on the actual 155-caliber field gun itself. Within
two years he had made another breakthrough, discovering that the perfect length
for a cannon barrel is neither more nor less than forty-five times its caliber.
He perfected a new redesign of the standard 155-mm. field gun and called it the
GC (for gun caliber) 45. The new gun, with his extended-range shells, would
outgun any artillery in the entire Communist arsenal. But if he expected
contracts, he was disappointed. Again, the Pentagon stayed with the gun lobby
and its new idea for rocket-assisted shells at eight times the price per shell.
The performance of both shells was identical.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull’s fall from grace, when it came, started
innocently enough in 1976, when he was invited with CIA connivance to help
improve the artillery and shells of South Africa, which was then fighting the
Moscow-backed Cubans in Angola.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull was nothing if not politically naive—to an
amazing degree. He went, found he liked the South Africans, and got on well
with them. The fact that South Africa was an international outcast for its
apartheid policies did not worry him. He helped them redesign their artillery
along the lines of his increasingly sought-after GC-45 long-barreled long-range
howitzer. Later, the South Africans produced their own version, and it was
these cannon that smashed the Soviet artillery, rolling back the Russians and
Cubans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Returning to the United States, Bull continued
to ship his shells. In 1977, however, the United Nations imposed an arms
embargo on South Africa, and when Jimmy Carter became president, Bull was
arrested and charged with illegal exports to a forbidden regime. The CIA
dropped him like a hot potato. He was persuaded to stay silent and plead
guilty. It was a formality, he was told; he would get a slap on the wrist for a
technical breach.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On June 16, 1980, a U.S. judge sentenced Bull
to a year in prison, with six months suspended, and a fine of $105,000. He
actually served four months and seventeen days at Allenwood prison in
Pennsylvania. But for Bull that was not the point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was the shame and the disgrace that got to
him, plus the sense of betrayal. How could they have done this to him? he asked
reasonably. He had helped the United States wherever he could, taken her
citizenship, gone along with the CIA appeal. While he was in Allenwood, his
company, Space Research Corporation, went bankrupt and closed down. He was
ruined.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On emerging from jail he quit the United States
and Canada forever, emigrating to Brussels and starting all over again in a
one-room walk-up with a kitchenette. Friends said later that he was changed
after the trial, was never the same man again. He never forgave the CIA, and he
never forgave America; yet he struggled for years for a rehearing and a pardon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He returned to consultancy and took up an offer
that had been made to him before his trial: to work for China on the
improvement of its artillery. Through the early and mid-1980s Bull worked
mainly for Beijing and redesigned their artillery along the lines of his GC-4S
cannon, which was now being sold under world license by Voest-Alpine of
Austria, which had bought the patents from Bull for a one-time payment of two
million dollars. Bull always was a terrible businessman, or he would have been
a multimillionaire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While Bull had been away in China, things had
happened elsewhere. The South Africans had taken his designs and improved
greatly upon them, creating a towed howitzer called the G-5 from his GC-45 and
a self-propelled cannon, the G-6. Both had a range with extended shells of
forty kilometers. South Africa was selling them around the world. Because of
his poor deal with the South Africans, Bull got not a penny in royalties.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Among the clients for these guns was a certain
Saddam Hussein of Iraq. It was these cannon that broke the human waves of
Iranian fanatics in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, finally defeating them in the
Fao marshes. But Saddam Hussein had added a new twist, especially at the battle
of Fao. He had put poison gas in the shells.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull then worked for Spain and Yugoslavia,
converting the old Yugoslav Army’s Soviet-made 130-mm. artillery to the new
155-mm. cannon with the extended-range shells. Though he would never live to
see it, these were the guns, inherited by the Serbs on the collapse of
Yugoslavia, that were to pulverize the cities of the Croats and Muslims in the
civil war. And in 1987 he learned that the United States would, after all,
research the payloads-into-space cannon—but with Gerry Bull firmly cut out of
the deal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That winter he received a strange phone call from the
Iraqi embassy in Bonn: Would Dr. Bull like to visit Baghdad as Iraq’s guest?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What he did not know was that in the mid-1980s,
Iraq had witnessed Operation Staunch, a concerted American effort to shut off
all sources of weapons imports destined for Iran. This followed the carnage
among American Marines in Beirut when Iranian-backed Hezbollah fanatics
attacked their barracks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Iraq’s reaction, although they benefited in
their war with Iran from Operation Staunch, was: If the Americans can do that
to Iran, they can do it to us. From then on, Iraq determined to import not the
arms but wherever possible the technology to make their own. Bull was first and
foremost a designer; he interested them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The mission to recruit him went to Amer Saadi,
who was number two at the Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization,
known as MIMI. When Bull arrived in Baghdad in January 1988, Amer Saadi, a
smooth, cosmopolitan diplomat/scientist speaking English, French, and German as
well as Arabic, played him beautifully.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iraqis, he said, wanted Bull’s help with
their dream of putting peaceful satellites into space. To do this, they had to
design a rocket that could put the payload up there. Their Egyptian and Brazilian
scientists had suggested that the first step would be to tie together five Scud
missiles, of which Iraq had bought nine hundred from the Soviet Union. But
there were technical problems, many problems. They needed access to a
supercomputer. Could Bull help them?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull loved problems—they were his raison d’être.
He did not have access to a supercomputer, but on two legs he himself was the
nearest thing. Besides, he told Amer Saadi, if Iraq really wanted to be the
first Arab nation to put satellites into space, there was another way—cheaper,
simpler, faster than rockets starting from scratch. Tell me all, said the
Iraqi. So Bull did.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For just three million dollars, he said, he
could produce a giant gun that would do the job. It would be a five-year
program. He could beat the Americans at Livermore to the punch. It would be an
Arab triumph. Dr. Saadi glowed with admiration. He would put the idea to his
government and recommend it strongly. In the meantime, would Dr. Bull look at
the Iraqi artillery?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the end of his one-week visit, Bull had
agreed to crack the problems of tying five Scuds together to form the first
stage of a rocket of intercontinental or space-reaching performance; to design
two new artillery pieces for the Army; and to put a formal proposal for his
payload-into-orbit Supergun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As with South Africa, he was able to block his
mind to the nature of the regime he was about to serve. Friends had told him of
Saddam Hussein’s record as the man with the bloodiest hands in the Middle East.
But in 1988 there were thousands of respectable companies and dozens of
governments clamoring to do business with big-spending Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For Bull, the bait was his gun, his beloved
gun, his life’s dream, at last with a backer who was prepared to help him bring
it to fulfillment and join the pantheon of scientists.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In March 1988, Amer Saadi sent a diplomat to
Brussels to talk to Bull. Yes, said the gun designer, he had made progress on
the technical problems of the first stage of the Iraqi rocket. He would be glad
to hand them over on signature of a contract with his company, once again the
Space Research Corporation. The deal was done. The Iraqis realized that his
offer of a gun for only three million dollars was silly; they raised it to ten
million but asked for more speed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When Bull worked fast, he worked amazingly
fast. In one month he put together a team of the best available free-lancers he
could find. Heading the Supergun team in Iraq was a British projects engineer
called Christopher Cowley. Bull himself christened the rocket program, based at
Saad 16 in northern Iraq, Project Bird. The Supergun task was named Project
Babylon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By May, the exact specifications of Babylon had
been worked out. It would be an incredible machine. One meter of bore; a barrel
156 meters long and weighing 1,665 tons—the height of the Washington Monument.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull had already made plain to Baghdad that he
would have to make a smaller prototype, a Mini-Babylon, with a 350-mm. bore
weighing only 113 tons. But in this he could test nose cones that would also be
useful for the rocket project. The Iraqis liked this—they needed nose-cone
technology as well.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The full significance of the insatiable Iraqi
appetite for nose-cone technology seems to have escaped Gerry Bull at the time.
Maybe, in his limitless enthusiasm to see his life’s dream realized at last, he
just suppressed it. Nose cones of very advanced design are needed to prevent a
payload from burning up from friction heat as it reenters earth’s atmosphere.
But orbiting payloads in space do not return; they stay up there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By late May 1988, Christopher Cowley was
placing his first orders with Walter Somers of Birmingham for the tube sections
that would make up the barrel of Mini-Babylon. The sections for full-scale
Babylons 1, 2, 3, and 4 would come later. Other strange steel orders were
placed all around Europe.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pace at which Bull was working was awesome.
Within two months he covered ground that would have taken a government
enterprise two years. By the end of 1988, he had designed for Iraq two new guns—self-propelled
guns, as opposed to the towed machines supplied by South Africa. Both pieces
would be so powerful, they could crush the guns of the surrounding nations of
Iran, Turkey, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, who purchased theirs from NATO and
America.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull also managed to crack the problems of
tying the five Scuds together to form the first stage of the Bird rocket, to be
called Al-Abeid, “the Believer.” He had discovered that the Iraqis and
Brazilians at Saad 16 were working on faulty data, produced by a wind tunnel
that was itself malfunctioning. After that, he handed over his fresh
calculations and left the Brazilians to get on with it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In May 1989 most of the world’s armaments
industry and press, along with government observers and intelligence officers,
attended a great weapons exhibition in Baghdad. Considerable interest was shown
in the mock-up prototypes of the two great guns. In December, the Al-Abeid was
test-fired to great media hoopla, seriously jolting Western analysts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Heavily covered by Iraqi TV cameras, the great
three-stage rocket roared off from the Al-Anbar Space Research Base, climbed
away from the earth, and disappeared. Three days later, Washington admitted
that the rocket did indeed appear capable of putting a satellite into space.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the analysts worked out more. If Al-Abeid
could do that, it could also be an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Suddenly, Western intelligence agencies were jerked out of their assumption
that Saddam Hussein was no real danger, years away from being a serious threat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three main intelligence agencies, the CIA
in America, the Secret Intelligence Service—SIS—in Britain, and the Mossad in
Israel, came to the view that of the two systems, the Babylon gun was an
amusing toy and the Bird rocket a real threat. All three got it wrong. It was
the Al-Abeid that did not work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bull knew why, and he told the Israelis what
had happened. The Al-Abeid had soared to twelve thousand meters and been lost
to view. The second stage had refused to separate from the first. The third
stage had not existed. It had been a dummy. He knew because he had been charged
with trying to persuade China to provide a third stage and would be going to
Beijing in February.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He did indeed go, and the Chinese turned him
down flat. While he was there, he met and talked at length with his old friend
George Wong. Something had gone wrong with the Iraqi business, something that
was worrying the hell out of Gerry Bull, and it was not the Israelis. Several
times he insisted he wanted out of Iraq, and in a hurry. Something had happened
inside his own head, and he wanted out of Iraq. In this decision he was
entirely right, but too late.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On February 15,1990, President Saddam Hussein called a
full meeting of his group of inner advisers at his palace at Sarseng, high up
in the Kurdish mountains.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He liked Sarseng. It stands on a hilltop, and
through its triple-glazed windows he could gaze out and down to the surrounding
countryside, where the Kurdish peasants huddled through the bitter winters in their
shacks and hovels. It was not many miles from here to the terrified town of
Halabja, where for the two days of March 17 and 18 in the year 1988, he had
ordered the seventy thousand citizens to be punished for their alleged
collaboration with the Iranians.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When his artillery had finished, five thousand
Kurdish dogs were dead and seven thousand maimed for life. Personally, he had
been quite impressed with the effects of the hydrogen cyanide sprayed out from
the artillery shells. The German companies that had helped him with the
technology to acquire and create the gas—along with the nerve agents Tabun and
Sarin—had his gratitude. They had earned it with their gas, similar to the
Zyklon-B which had so properly been used on the Jews years before and might well
be again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He stood before the windows of his dressing
room and gazed down that morning. He had been in power, undisputed power, for
sixteen years, and he had been forced to punish many people. But much also had
been achieved.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A new Sennacherib had risen out of Nineveh and
another Nebuchadnezzar out of Babylon. Some had learned the easy way, by
submission. Others had learned the hard, the very hard way and were mostly
dead. Still others, many others, had yet to learn. But they would, they would.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He listened as the convoy of helicopters
clattered in from the south, while his dresser fussed to adjust the green
kerchief he liked to wear in the V above his combat jacket to hide his jowls.
When all was to his satisfaction, he took his personal sidearm, a gold-plated
Beretta of Iraqi make, bolstered and belted, and secured it around his waist.
He had used it before on a cabinet minister and might wish to again. He always
carried it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A flunky tapped on the door and informed the
President that those he had summoned awaited him in the conference room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he entered the long room with the
plate-glass windows dominating the snowy landscape, everyone rose in unison.
Only up here at Sarseng did his fear of assassination diminish. He knew that
the palace was ringed by three lines of the best of his presidential security
detail, the Amn-al-Khass, commanded by his own son Kusay, and that no one could
approach those great windows. On the roof were French Crotale antiaircraft
missiles, and his fighters ranged the skies above the mountains.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He sat himself down in the throne-like chair at
the center of the top table that formed the crossbar of the T. Flanking him,
two on each side, were four of his most trusted aides. For Saddam Hussein there
was only one quality he demanded of a man in his favor: loyalty. Absolute,
total, slavish loyalty. Within this quality, experience had taught him, there
were gradations. At the top of the list came family; after that the clan; then
the tribe. There is an Arabic saying: “I and my brother against our cousin; I
and my cousin against the world.” He believed in it. It worked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had come from the gutters of a small town
called Tikrit and from the tribe of the Al-Tikriti. An extraordinary number of
his family and the Al-Tikriti were in high office in Iraq, and they could be
forgiven any brutality, any failure, any personal excess, provided they were
loyal to him. Had not his second son, the psychopathic Uday, beaten a servant
to death and been forgiven?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To his right sat Izzat Ibrahim, his first deputy,
and beyond was his son-in-law, Hussein Kamil, head of MIMI, the man in charge
of weapons procurement. To his left were Taha Ramadam, the Prime Minister, and
beyond him Sadoun Hammadi, the Deputy Premier and devout Shi’a Moslem. Saddam
Hussein was Sunni, but his one and only area of tolerance was in matters of
religion. As a non-observer (except when it suited), he did not care. His
Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, was a Christian. So what? He did what he was
told.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Army chiefs were near the top of the stem
of the T, the generals commanding the Republican Guard, the Infantry, the Armor,
the Artillery, and the Engineers. Further down came the four experts whose
reports and expertise were the reason he had called the meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two sat to the right of the table: Dr. Amer
Saadi, technologist and deputy to his son-in-law, and beside him Brigadier
Hassan Rahmani, head of the Counterintelligence wing of the Mukhabarat, or
Intelligence Service. Facing them were Dr. Ismail Ubaidi, controlling the
foreign arm of the Mukhabarat, and Brigadier Omar Khatib, boss of the feared
Secret Police, the Amn-al-Amm, or AMAM.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three secret service men had clearly denned
tasks. Dr. Ubaidi conducted espionage abroad; Rahmani counterattacked
foreign-mounted espionage inside Iraq; Khatib kept the Iraqi population in
order, crushing all possible internal opposition through a combination of his
vast network of watchers and informers and the sheer, stark terror generated by
the rumors of what he did to opponents arrested and dragged to the Abu Ghraib
jail west of Baghdad or to his personal interrogation center known jokingly as
the Gymnasium beneath the AMAM headquarters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Many had been the complaints brought to Saddam
Hussein about the brutality of his Secret Police chief, but he always chuckled
and waved them away. It was rumored that he personally had given Khatib his
nickname Al-Mu’azib, “the Tormentor.” Khatib, of course, was Al-Tikriti and
loyal to the end.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Some dictators, when delicate matters are to be
discussed, like to keep the meeting small. Saddam thought the opposite; if
there was dirty work to be done, they should all be involved. No man could say:
“I have clean hands, I did not know.” In this way, all around him would get the
message: “If I fall, you fall.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When all had resumed their seats, the President
nodded to his son-in-law Hussein Kamil, who called on Dr. Saadi to report. The
technocrat read his report without raising his eyes. No wise man raised his
eyes to stare Saddam in the face. The President claimed he could read into a
man’s soul through his eyes, and many believed it. Staring into his face might
signify courage, defiance, disloyalty. If the President suspected disloyalty,
the offender usually died horribly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When Dr. Saadi had finished, Saddam thought for
a while.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This man, this Canadian. How much does he
know?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not all, but enough, I believe, to work it
out, <i>sayidi</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saadi used the honorific Arabic address
equivalent to the Western sir, but more respectful. An alternative acceptable
title was <i>Sayid Rais</i>, or “Mr. President.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How soon?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Soon, if not already, <i>sayidi</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And he has been talking to the Israelis?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Constantly, <i>Sayid Rais</i>,” replied Dr.
Ubaidi. “He has been friends of theirs for years. Visited Tel Aviv and given
lectures on ballistics to their artillery staff officers. He has many friends
there, possibly among the Mossad, though he may not know that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Could we finish the project without him?”
asked Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hussein Kamil cut in. “He is a strange man. He
insists on carrying all his most intimate scientific paperwork around with him
in a big canvas bag. I instructed our counterintelligence people to have a look
at this paperwork and copy it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And this was done?” The President was staring
at Hassan Rahmani, his Counterintelligence chief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Immediately, <i>Sayid Rais</i>. Last month
during his visit here. He drinks much whiskey. It was doped, and he slept long
and deep. We took his bag and photocopied every page in it. Also, we have taped
all his technical conversations. The papers and the transcripts have all been
passed to our comrade Dr. Saadi.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The presidential stare swiveled back to the
scientist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So, once again, can you complete the project
without him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, <i>Sayid Rais</i>, I believe we can. Some
of his calculations make sense only to himself, but I have had our best
mathematicians studying them for a month. They can understand them. The
engineers can do the rest.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hussein Kamil shot his deputy a warning look:
You had better be right, my friend.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where is he now?” asked the President.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He has left for China, <i>sayidi</i>,” replied
Dr. Ubaidi. “He is trying to find us a third stage for the Al-Abeid rocket.
Alas, he will fail. He is expected back in Brussels in mid-March.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You have men there, good men?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, <i>sayidi</i>. I have had him under
surveillance in Brussels for ten months. That is how we know he has been
entertaining Israeli delegations at his offices there. We also have keys to his
apartment building.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then let it be done. On his return.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Without delay, <i>Sayid Rais</i>.” Dr. Ubaidi
thought of the four men he had in Brussels on arm’s-length surveillance work.
One of them had done this before: Abdelrahman Moyeddin. He would give the job
to him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three intelligence men and Dr. Saadi were
dismissed. The rest stayed. When they were alone, Saddam Hussein turned to his
son-in-law.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the other matter—when will I have it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I am assured, by the end of the year, <i>Abu
Kusay</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Being family, Kamil could use the more intimate
title “Father of Kusay.” It reminded the others present who was family and who
was not. The President grunted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We shall need a place, a new place, a
fortress; not an existing place, however secret. A new secret place that no one
will know about. No one but a tiny handful, not even all of us here. Not a
civil engineering project, but military. Can you do it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Ali Musuli of the Army Engineers
straightened his back, staring at the President’s midchest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“With pride, <i>Sayid Rais</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The man in charge—your best, your very best.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know the man, <i>sayidi</i>. A colonel.
Brilliant at construction and deception. The Russian Stepanov said he was the
best pupil in <i>maskirovka</i> that he had ever taught.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then bring him to me. Not here—in Baghdad, in
two days. I will commission him myself. Is he a good Ba’athist, this colonel?
Loyal to the party and to me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Utterly, <i>sayidi</i>. He would die for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So would you all, I hope.” There was a pause,
then quietly: “Let us hope it does not come to that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As a conversation-stopper, it worked.
Fortunately that was the end of the meeting anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dr. Gerry Bull arrived back in Brussels on March 17,
exhausted and depressed. His colleagues assumed his depression was caused by
his rebuff in China. But it was more than that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ever since he had arrived in Baghdad more than
two years earlier, he had allowed himself to be persuaded—because it was what
he wanted to believe—that the rocket program and the Babylon gun were for the
launch of small, instrument-bearing satellites into earth orbit. He could see
the enormous benefits in self-esteem and pride for the whole Arab world if Iraq
could do that. Moreover, it would be lucrative, pay its way, as Iraq launched
communications and weather satellites for other nations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As he understood it, the plan was for Babylon
to fire its satellite-bearing missile southeast over the length of Iraq, on over
Saudi Arabia and the south Indian Ocean, and into orbit. That was what he had
designed it for.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had been forced to agree with his colleagues
that no Western nation would see it that way. They would assume it was a
military gun. Hence, the subterfuge in the ordering of the barrel parts,
breech, and recoil mechanism.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only he, Gerald Vincent Bull, knew the truth,
which was very simple—the Babylon gun could not be used as a weapon for
launching conventional explosive shells, however gigantic those shells might
be.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For one thing, the Babylon gun, with its
156-meter barrel, could not stay rigid without supports. It needed one
trunnion, or support, for every second of its twenty-six barrel sections, even
if, as he foresaw, its barrel ran up the forty-five-degree side of a mountain.
Without these supports, the barrel would droop like wet spaghetti and tear
itself apart as the joins ripped open.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Therefore, it could not raise or depress its
elevation, nor traverse from side to side. So it could not pick a variety of
targets. To change its angle, up or down or side to side, it would have to be
dismantled, taking weeks. Even to clean out and reload between discharges would
take a couple of days. Moreover, repeated firings would wear out that very
expensive barrel. Lastly, Babylon could not be hidden from counterattack.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Every time it fired, a gobbet of flame ninety
meters long would leap from its barrel, and every satellite and airplane would
spot it. Its map coordinates would be with the Americans in seconds. Also, its
reverberation shock waves would reach any good seismograph as far away as
California. That was why he told anyone who would listen, “It cannot be used as
a weapon.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His problem was that after two years in Iraq,
he had realized that for Saddam Hussein science had one application and one
only: It was to be applied to weapons of war and the power they brought him <i>and
to nothing else</i>. So why the hell was he financing Babylon? It could only
fire once in anger before the retaliatory fighter-bombers blew it to bits, and
it could only fire a satellite or a conventional shell.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was in China, in the company of the
sympathetic George Wong, that he cracked it. It was the last equation he would
ever solve.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The big Ram Charger sped down the main highway from Qatar
toward Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, making good time. The air
conditioning kept the interior cool, and the driver had some of his favorite
country-and-western tapes filling the interior with back-home sounds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beyond Ruweis, they were out in open country,
the sea to their left only intermittently visible between the dunes, to their
right the great desert stretching away hundreds of bleak and sandy miles toward
Dhofar and the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beside her husband Maybelle Walker gazed
excitedly at the ochre-brown desert shimmering under the midday sun. Ray Walker
kept his eyes on the road. An oil man all his life, he had seen deserts before.
“Seen one, seen ’em all,” he would grunt when his wife made one of her frequent
exclamations of wonderment at the sights and sounds that were so new to her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But for Maybelle Walker it was all new, and
although she had packed enough medications before leaving Oklahoma to open a
new branch of Eckerd, she had loved every minute of her two-week tour of the
Arabian Gulf—what used to be called the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had started in the north in Kuwait, then
driven the off-road loaned them by the company south into Saudi Arabia through
Khafji and Al-Khobar, crossed the causeway into Bahrain, then back and down
through Qatar and into the UAE. At each stopover Ray Walker had made a
perfunctory “inspection” of his company office—the ostensible reason for the
trip—while she had taken a guide from the company office and explored the local
sights. She felt very brave going down all those narrow streets with only a
single white man for an escort, unaware that she would have been in more danger
in any of fifty American cities than among the Gulf Arabs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sights enthralled her on her first and
perhaps last journey outside the United States. She admired the palaces and the
minarets, wondered at the torrent of raw gold on display in the gold <i>soukhs</i>,
and was awed by the tide of dark faces and multicolored robes that swirled
about her in the Old Quarters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She had taken photographs of everything and
everyone so she could show the ladies’ club back home where she had been and
what she had seen. She had taken to heart the warning by the company
representative in Qatar to be careful of taking a picture of a desert Arab
without his permission, as some still believed the taking of a photograph
captured part of the target’s soul.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was, she frequently reminded herself, a
happy woman and had much to be happy about. Married almost straight out of high
school to her steady date of two years, she found herself wedded to a good,
solid man with a job in a local oil company who had risen through the ranks as
the company expanded, until he was now finishing as one of the vice-presidents.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had a nice home outside Tulsa and a beach
house for summer vacations at Hatteras, between the Atlantic and Pamlico Sound
in North Carolina. It had been a good thirty-year marriage, rewarded with one
fine son. And now this, a two-week tour at the company’s expense of all the
exotic sights and sounds, smells, and experiences of another world, the Arabian
Gulf.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s a good road,” she remarked as they
crested a rise and the strip of bitumen shimmered and shivered away in front of
them. If the temperature inside the vehicle was seventy degrees, it was one
hundred and twenty out there in the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ought to be,” her husband grunted. “We built
it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The company?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nah. Uncle Sam, goddammit.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ray Walker had a habit of adding the single
word <i>goddammit</i> when he dispensed pieces of information. They sat for a
while in companionable silence while Tammy Wynette urged her to stand by her
man, which she always had done and intended to do through their retirement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nudging sixty, Ray Walker was taking retirement
with a good pension and some healthy stock options, and a grateful company had
offered him the two-week, all-expense-paid, first-class tour of the Gulf to “inspect”
its various outstations along the coast. Though he too had never been there
before, he had to admit he was less enthralled by it all than his wife, but he
was delighted for her sake.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Personally, he was looking forward to finishing
with Abu Dhabi and Dubai, then catching the first-class cabin of an airliner
aimed directly at the United States via London. At least he would be able to
order a long, cold Bud without having to scuttle into the company office for
it. Islam might be all right for some, he mused, but after staying in the best
hotels in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and being told they were completely dry, he
wondered what kind of a religion would stop a guy from having a cool beer on a
hot day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was dressed in what he perceived to be the
rig of an oil man in the desert—tall boots, jeans, belt, shirt, and Stetson—which
was not entirely necessary, as he was really a chemist in quality control.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He checked the odometer: eighty miles to the
Abu Dhabi turnoff.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Gonna have to take a leak, honey,” he
muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well then, you be careful,” warned Maybelle. “There
are scorpions out there.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But they can’t leap two feet,” he said, and
roared at his own joke. Being stung on the dick by a high-jumping scorpion—that
was a good one for the boys back home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ray, you are a terrible man,” replied
Maybelle, and laughed also. Walker swung the Ram Charger to the edge of the
empty road and opened the door. The blast of heat came in as if from the door
of a furnace. He climbed out and slammed the door behind him to trap the cool
air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Maybelle stayed in the passenger seat as her
husband walked to the nearest dune and unzipped his fly. Then she stared out
through the windshield and muttered:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, my God, would you just look at that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She reached for her Pentax, opened her door,
and slithered to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ray, do you think he’d mind if I took his
picture?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ray was facing the other way, absorbed in one
of a middle-aged man’s greater satisfactions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Be right with you, honey. Who?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Bedouin was standing across the road from
her husband, having apparently walked out from between two dunes. One minute he
was not there, the next he was. Maybelle Walker stood by the front fender of
the off-road, her camera in her hand, irresolute. Her husband turned around and
zipped himself up. He stared at the man across the road.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dunno,” he said. “Guess not. But don’t get too
close. Probably got fleas. I’ll get the engine started. You take a quick picture,
and if he gets nasty, jump right in. Fast.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He climbed back into the driver’s seat and
gunned the engine. That boosted the air conditioner, which was a relief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Maybelle Walker took several steps forward and
held up her camera.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“May I take your picture?” she asked. “Camera?
Picture? Click-click? For my album back home?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man just stood and stared at her. His
once-white <i>djellaba</i>, stained and dusty, dropped from his shoulders to
the sand at his feet. The red-and-white flecked <i>keffiyeh</i> was secured on
his head by a two-strand black cord, and one of the trailing corners was tucked
up under the opposite temple so that the cloth covered his face from the bridge
of the nose downward. Above the flecked doth the dark eyes stared back at her.
What little skin of forehead and eye sockets she could see was burned brown by
the desert. She had many pictures ready for the album she intended to make back
home, but none of a tribesman of the Bedouin with the expanse of the Saudi
desert behind him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She raised her camera. The man did not move.
She squinted through the aperture, framing the figure in the center of the
oblong, wondering if she could make the car in time, should the Arab come
running at her. <i>Click</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you very much,” she said. Still he did
not move. She backed toward the car, smiling brightly. “Always smile,” she
recalled the <i>Reader’s Digest </i>once advising Americans confronted by
someone who cannot understand English.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Honey, get in the car!” her husband shouted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s all right, I think he’s okay,” she said,
opening the door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The audiotape had run out while she was taking
the picture. That cut the radio station in. Ray Walker’s hand reached out and
hauled her into the car, which screeched away from the roadside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Arab watched them go, shrugged, and walked
behind the sand dune, where he had parked his own sand-camouflaged Land-Rover.
In a few seconds he too drove off in the direction of Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What’s the hurry?” complained Maybelle Walker.
“He wasn’t going to attack me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s not the point, honey.” Ray Walker was
tight-lipped, the man in control, able to cope with any international
emergency. “We’re getting into Abu Dhabi and taking the next flight home. It
seems this morning Iraq invaded Kuwait, goddammit. They could be here any hour.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was ten o’clock, Gulf Time, on the morning
of August 2, 1990.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Twelve hours earlier, Colonel Osman Badri waited, tense
and excited, by the tracks of a stationary T-72 main battle tank near a small
airfield called Safwan. Though he could not know it then, the war for Kuwait
would begin there and it would end there, at Safwan.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just outside the airfield, which had runways
but no buildings on it, the main highway ran north and south. On the northward
road, down which he had traveled three days earlier, was the junction where
travelers could turn east for Basra or northwest for Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>South, the road ran straight through the
Kuwaiti border post five miles away. From where he stood, looking south, he
could see the dim glow of Jahra, and beyond it, farther east across the bay,
the glow of the lights of Kuwait City itself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was excited because his country’s time had
come. Time to punish the Kuwaiti scum for what they had done to Iraq, for the
undeclared economic warfare, for the financial damage and their haughty arrogance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Had not his country for eight bloody years held
off the hordes of Persia from sweeping into the northern Gulf and ending all
their luxury lifestyles? And was her reward now to sit silent while the
Kuwaitis stole more than their fair portion of the oil from the shared Rumailah
field? Were they now to be beggared as Kuwait overproduced and drove the oil
price downward? Should they now meekly succumb as the Al Sabah dogs insisted on
repayment of the miserable $15 billion loan they had made to Iraq during the
war?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No, the Rais had gotten it right as usual.
Kuwait was historically the nineteenth province of Iraq; always had been, until
the British drew their damned line in the sand in 1913 and created the richest
emirate in the world. Kuwait would be reclaimed this night, this very night,
and Osman Badri would be a part of it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As an Army Engineer, he would not be in the
first line, but he would come close behind with his bridging units,
earthmovers, bulldozers, and sappers to cut open the path should the Kuwaitis
try to block it. Not that aerial surveillance had shown any obstructions. No
earthworks, no sand berms, no antitank trenches, no concrete traps. But just in
case, the engineers would be there under the command of Osman Badri to cut open
the road for the tanks and mechanized infantry of the Republican Guard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A few yards from where he stood, the field
command tent was full of the senior officers poring over their maps and making
last-minute adjustments to their plan of attack as the hours and minutes ticked
by while they waited for the final “go” order from the Rais in Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Badri had already seen and conversed
with his own commanding general, All Musuli, who was in charge of the entire
Engineering Corps of the Iraqi Army and to whom he owed utter devotion for
recommending him for the “special duty” last February. He had been able to
assure his chief that his—Badri’s—men were fully equipped and ready to go.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As he stood talking with Musuli, another
general had strolled up, and he had been introduced to Abdullah Kadiri,
commander of the tanks. In the distance he had seen General Saadi Tumah Abbas,
commanding the elite Republican Guard, enter the tent. As a loyal Party member
and worshipper of Saddam Hussein, he had been perplexed to hear the tank general
Kadiri mutter “political creep” under his breath. How could this be? Was not
Tumah Abbas an intimate of Saddam Hussein, and had he not been rewarded for
winning the crucial battle of Fao that finally beat the Iranians? Colonel Badri
had dismissed from his mind rumors that Fao had actually been won by the
now-vanished General Maher Rashid.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All around him, men and officers of the
Tawakkulna and Medina divisions of the Guard swarmed in the darkness. His
thoughts strayed back to that memorable night in February, when General Musuli
had ordered him from his duties putting the finishing touches to the facility
at Al Qubai to report to headquarters in Baghdad. He had assumed he would be
reassigned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The President wants to see you,” Musuli had
said abruptly. “He will send for you. Move into the officers’ quarters here,
and keep yourself available night and day.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Badri bit his lip. What had he done?
What had he said? Nothing disloyal—that would have been impossible. Had he been
falsely denounced? No, the President would not send for such a man. The
wrongdoer would simply be picked up by one of the goon squads of Brigadier
Khatib’s Amn-al-Amm and taken away to be taught a lesson. Seeing his face,
General Musuli burst out laughing, his teeth flashing beneath the heavy black
moustache that so many senior officers wore in imitation of Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t worry. He has a task for you, a special
task.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And he had. Within twenty-four hours Badri had
been summoned to the lobby of the officers’ quarters, where a long black staff
car was waiting for him, with two men from the Amn-al-Khass, the presidential
security detail. He was whisked straight to the Presidential Palace for the
most thrilling and momentous meeting of his life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The palace was then situated in the angle of
Kindi Street and July 14 Street, near the bridge of the same name, both
celebrating the date of the first of the two coups of July 1968 that had
brought the Ba’ath Party to power and broken the rule of the generals. Badri
was shown into a waiting room and kept there for two hours. He was frisked
thoroughly, twice, before being shown into the Presence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As soon as the guards beside him stopped, he
stopped, then threw up a quivering salute and held it for three seconds, before
whipping off his beret and swinging it under his left arm. After that he
remained at attention.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So you are the genius of <i>maskirovka</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had been told not to look the Rais straight
in the eyes, but when he was spoken to he could not help it. Saddam Hussein was
in a good mood. The eyes of the young officer in front of him shone with love
and admiration. Good, nothing to fear. In measured tones the Rais told the
engineer what he wanted. Badri’s chest swelled with pride and gratitude.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For five months after that, he had worked against
the impossible deadline and succeeded with days to spare. He had had all the
facilities the Rais had promised him. Everything and everyone was at his
disposal. If he needed more concrete or steel, he had but to call Kamil on his
personal number, and the President’s son-in-law would provide it at once from
Ministry of Industry sources. If he needed more manpower, hundreds of laborers
would arrive, and always indentured Koreans or Vietnamese. They cut and they
dug, they lived in miserable cantonments down in the valley during that summer,
and then they were taken away, he did not know where.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Apart from the coolies, no one came in by road,
for the single rough track, eventually to be obliterated itself, was only for
the trucks bringing steel and cargo, and the cement-mixers. Every other human
being except the truck drivers came in by one of the Russian MIL helicopters,
and only when they arrived were their blindfolds removed, to be replaced when
they left. This applied to the most senior as to the humblest Iraqi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Badri had chosen the site himself, after days
of scouting by helicopter over the mountains. He had finally picked his spot
high in the Jebal al Hamreen, north and farther into the mountains from Kifri,
where the hills of the Hamreen range become mountains on the road to
Sulaymaniyam.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had worked twenty hours a day, slept rough
on the site, bullied, threatened, cajoled, and bribed amazing work performances
from his men, and finally it had been done before the end of July. The area had
been cleared of every trace of work, every brick and lump of concrete, every
piece of steel that might glint in the sun, every scrape and scratch on the
rocks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three guardian villages had been completed
and inhabited with their goats and sheep. Finally, the single track had been
obliterated, tumbled in rough rubble and scree into the valley beneath by an
earth-mover trundling backward, and the three valleys and the raped mountain
had been restored to what they once were. Almost.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For he, Osman Badri, colonel of engineers,
inheritor of the building skills that had erected Nineveh and Tyre, student of
the great Stepanov of Russia, master of <i>maskirovka</i>, the art of
disguising something to look like nothing or something else, had built for
Saddam Hussein the Qa’ala, the Fortress. No one could see it, and no one knew
where it was.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before it was closed over, Badri had watched
the others, the gun assemblers and the scientists, build that awesome cannon
whose barrel seemed to reach up to the very stars. When all was complete they
left, and only the garrison remained behind. They would stay and live there.
None would walk out. Those who had to arrive or leave would do so by
helicopter. None of these would land; they would hover over a small patch of
grass away from the mountain. The few arriving or leaving would always be
blindfolded. The pilots and crew would be sealed inside one single air base
with neither visitors nor phones. The last wild grass seeds were scattered, the
last shrubs planted, and the Fortress was left alone to its isolation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though Badri did not know it, the workers who
had arrived by truck were finally driven away, then transferred to buses with
blackened windows. Far away in a gulch the buses containing the three thousand
Asian workers were stopped, and the guards ran away. When the detonations
brought down the mountain side all the buses were buried forever. Then the
guards were shot by others. They had all seen the Qa’ala.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Badri’s reverie was interrupted by an eruption
of shouting from the command tent, and word ran quickly through the crowds of
waiting soldiers that the attack was “go.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The engineer ran to his truck and hauled
himself into the passenger seat as his driver gunned the engine. They held
position as the tank crews of the two Guard divisions that would spearhead the
invasion filled the air with ear-shattering noise and the Russian T-72s rumbled
off the airfield and onto the road to Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was, he would later tell his brother
Abdelkarim, a fighter pilot and colonel in the Air Force, like a turkey shoot.
The miserable police post on the border was brushed aside and crushed. By two <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> the column was over the border and rolling
south. If the Kuwaitis were kidding themselves that this army, the
fourth-largest standing army in the world, was going to advance to the Mutla
Ridge and rattle its sabers until Kuwait acceded to the demands of the Rais,
they were out of luck. If the West thought this army would just capture the
desired islands of Warbah and Bubiyan, giving Iraq its long-lusted-for access
to the Gulf, they too were up the wrong tree. The orders from Baghdad were:
Take it all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just before dawn, there was a tank engagement
at the small Kuwaiti oil town of Jahra, north of Kuwait City. The only Kuwaiti
armored brigade had been rushed northward, having been held back in the week
before the invasion in order not to provoke the Iraqis.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was one-sided. The Kuwaitis, who were
supposed to be no more than merchants and oil profiteers, fought hard and well.
They held up the cream of the Republican Guard for an hour, which allowed some
of their Skyhawk and Mirage fighters farther south at the Ahmadi air base to
get airborne, but the Kuwaitis did not stand a chance. The huge Soviet T-72s
cut to pieces the smaller Chinese T-55s used by the Kuwaitis. The defenders
lost twenty tanks in as many minutes, and finally the survivors pulled out and
back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Osman Badri, watching from a mile away as the
mastodons swerved and fired in the belching clouds of dust and smoke while a
pink line touched the sky over Iran, could not know that one day these same
T-72s of the Medina and Tawakkulna divisions would themselves be blown apart by
the Challengers and Abramses of the British and Americans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By dawn, the first point units were rumbling
into the northwestern outskirts of Kuwait City, dividing their forces to cover
the four highways that gave access to the city from that quarter; the Abu Dhabi
road along the seashore, the Jahra road between Granada and Andalus suburbs,
and the Fifth and Sixth Ring highways farther south. After the split, the four
prongs headed into central Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Badri was hardly needed. There were no
ditches for his sappers to fill in, nor obstructions to be blown away with
dynamite, nor concrete bollards to be bulldozed. Only once did he have to dive for
his life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rolling along through Sulaibikhat, quite close
(though he did not know it) to the Christian cemetery, a single Sky hawk
wheeled out of the sun and targeted the tank ahead of him with four
air-to-ground rockets. The tank jolted, lost a track, and began to burn. The
panicking crew poured from the turret. Then the Skyhawk was back, going for the
following trucks, flames flickering from its nose. Badri saw the tarmac erupt
in front of him and hurled himself from the door just as his screaming driver
hauled the truck off the road, into a ditch, and turned it over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No one was hurt, but Badri was furious. The
impudent dog. He finished the journey in another truck.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was sporadic gunfire all through the day
as the two divisions, with their armor, artillery, and mechanized infantry,
rolled through the sprawl of Kuwait City. At the Defense Ministry a group of
Kuwaiti officers shut themselves in and tried to take on the invaders with some
small arms they found inside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of the Iraqi officers, in a spirit of sweet
reason, pointed out that they were dead men if he opened up with his tank gun.
While a few Kuwaiti resisters argued with him before surrendering, the rest
changed out of their uniforms into <i>dish-dash</i> and <i>ghutra</i> and
slipped away out the back. One of these would later become the leader of the
Kuwaiti resistance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The principal opposition occurred at the
residence of the Emir Al Sabah, even though he and his family had long before
fled south to seek sanctuary in Saudi Arabia. It was crushed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At sundown Colonel Osman Badri stood with his
back to the sea at the northernmost point of Kuwait City on Arabian Gulf Street
and stared at the facade of that residence, the Dasman Palace. Already a few
Iraqi soldiers were inside the palace, and now and then one would emerge
carrying a priceless artifact torn from the walls, stepping over the bodies on
the steps and the lawn to place the booty in a truck.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was tempted to take something himself, a
gift fine and worthy for his father at the old man’s home in Qadisiyah, but
something held him back: the heritage of that damned English school he had
attended all those years ago in Baghdad, and all because of his father’s
friendship with the Englishman Martin and his admiration of all things British.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Looting is stealing, boys, and stealing is
wrong. The Bible and the Koran forbid it. So do not do it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even to this day, he could recall Mr. Hartley,
the headmaster of the Tasisiya Foundation Preparatory School, run by the
British Council, lecturing his pupils, English and Iraqi, at their desks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>How often had he reasoned with his father since
joining the Ba’ath Party that the English had always been imperialist
aggressors, holding the Arabs in chains for centuries to reap their own
profits?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And his father, who was now seventy and so much
older because Osman and his brother had been born to the second marriage, had
always smiled and said:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe they are foreigners and infidel, but
they are courteous and they have standards, my son. And what standards does
your Mr. Saddam Hussein have, pray?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It had been impossible to get through the old
man’s thick skull how important the Party was to Iraq and how its leader would
bring Iraq to glory and triumph. Eventually he ceased these conversations, lest
his father say something about the Rais that would be overheard by a neighbor
and get them all into trouble. He disagreed with his father on this alone, for
he loved him very much.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So because of a headmaster twenty-five years
before, Colonel Badri now stood back and did not join in the looting of the
Dasman Palace, even though it was in the tradition of all his ancestors and the
English were fools.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At least his years at the Tasisiya school had
taught him fluent English, which had turned out to be useful because it was the
language in which he could best communicate with Colonel Stepanov, who had for
a long time been the senior engineering officer with the Soviet Military
Advisory Group before the cold war came to its end and he went back to Moscow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Osman Badri was thirty-five, and the year 1990
was proving to be the greatest of his whole life. As he told his elder brother
later:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I just stood there with my back to the Gulf
and the Dasman Palace in front of me and thought, ‘By the Prophet, we’ve done
it. We’ve taken Kuwait at last. And in just one day.’ And that was the end of
it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was wrong, as it happened. That was just the
beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>While Ray Walker was, in his own phrase, hauling ass
through the Abu Dhabi airport, hammering the sales counter to insist on the
American’s constitutional right to an instant airline ticket, a number of his
fellow countrymen were ending a sleepless night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Seven time zones away in Washington, the
National Security Council had been up all night. In earlier days they used to
have to meet personally in the Situation Room in the basement of the White
House; newer technology now meant they could confer by secure videolink from
their various locations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The previous evening, still August 1 in
Washington, early reports had indicated some firing along Kuwait’s northern
border. It was not unexpected. For days sweeps by the great KH-11 satellites
over the northern Gulf had shown the buildup of the Iraqi forces, telling
Washington more than the U.S. ambassador in Kuwait actually knew. The problem
was, What were Saddam Hussein’s intentions: to threaten or to invade?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Frantic requests had been sent the previous day
to the CIA headquarters at Langley, but the Agency had been less than helpful,
turning in “maybe” analyses on the basis of the satellite pictures garnered by
the National Reconnaissance Office and political savvy already known to the
State Department’s Middle East Division.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Any half-ass can do that,” growled Brent
Scowcroft, chairman of the NSC. “Don’t we have anyone right inside the Iraqi
regime?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The answer to that was a regretful no. It was a
problem that would recur for months.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The answer to the conundrum came before ten <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span>, when President George Bush went to bed
and took no further calls from Scowcroft. That was after dawn Gulf Time, and
the Iraqi tanks were beyond Jahra, entering the northwestern suburbs of Kuwait
City.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was, the participants would recall later,
quite a night. There were eight on the videolink, representing the NSC, the
Treasury, the State Department, the CIA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the
Pentagon. A flurry of orders went out and were implemented. A similar series
was coming out of a hastily convened COBRA (Cabinet Office Briefing Room Annex)
committee meeting in London, which was five hours away from Washington but Only
two from the Gulf.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Both governments froze all Iraqi financial
assets lodged abroad, as well as (with the agreement of the Kuwaiti ambassadors
in both cities) all Kuwaiti assets, so that any new puppet government working
for Baghdad could not get its hands on the funds. These decisions froze billions
and billions of petrodollars.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>President Bush was awakened at 4:45 <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> on August 2 to sign the documents. In
London, Margaret Thatcher, long up and about and raising seven levels of Cain,
had already done the same before going to catch her plane for the States.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Another major step was to hustle together the
United Nations Security Council in New York to condemn the invasion and call
for an immediate withdrawal by Iraq. This was achieved with Resolution 660,
signed at four-thirty <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> that same
morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Around dawn the videolink conference ended, and
the participants had two hours to get home, wash, change, shave, and be back at
the White House for the eight <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> full
meeting of the NSC, chaired by President Bush in person.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Newcomers at the full meeting included Richard
Cheney of Defense, Nicholas Brady of Treasury, and Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh. Bob Kimmitt continued to stand in for the State Department because
Secretary James Baker and Deputy Secretary Lawrence Eagleburger were both out
of town.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin
Powell had arrived back from Florida, bringing with him the general in charge
of Central Command, a big burly man of whom more would be heard later. Norman
Schwarzkopf was at General Powell’s side when they walked in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>George Bush left the meeting at 9:15 <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>, when Ray and Maybelle Walker were
thankfully airborne and somewhere over Saudi Arabia heading northwest for home
and safety. The President took a helicopter from the south lawn to Andrews Air
Force base, where he transferred to Air Force One and flew to Aspen, Colorado.
He was scheduled to give an address on U.S. defense needs. As it turned out, it
was an appropriate topic, but the day would be much busier than foreseen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In midair he took a long call from King Hussein
of Jordan, monarch of Iraq’s smaller and much-overshadowed neighbor. The
Hashemite King was in Cairo, conferring with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>King Hussein was desperate that the United
States give the Arab states a few days to try to sort things out without a war.
He himself proposed a four-state conference, including President Mubarak,
himself, and Saddam Hussein and as chairman His Majesty King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia. He was confident that such a conference would persuade the Iraqi
dictator to withdraw from Kuwait peaceably. But he needed three, maybe four days,
and no public condemnation of Iraq by any of the nations participant to the
conference.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>President Bush told him: “You got it. I defer
to you.” The unfortunate George had not yet met the lady from London, who was
waiting for him in Aspen. They met that evening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iron Lady soon got the impression that her
good friend was about to start wavering again. Within two hours she put a broom
handle so far up the President’s left trouser leg that it came out near the
collar line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He cannot, he simply cannot, be allowed to get
away with it, George.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Faced with those flashing blue eyes and the
cut-crystal tones slicing through the hum of the air conditioner, George Bush
admitted that this was not America’s intention either. His intimates later felt
he had been less worried by Saddam Hussein with his artillery and tanks than by
that daunting handbag.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On August 3, the United States had a quiet word
with Egypt. President Mubarak was reminded just how much his armed forces were
dependent on American weaponry, just how much Egypt owed the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, and just how much U.S. aid came his way. On August
4 the Egyptian government issued a public statement roundly condemning Saddam
Hussein’s invasion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To the Jordanian King’s dismay but not to his
surprise, the Iraqi despot at once refused to go to the Jeddah conference and
sit beside Hosni Mubarak under the chairmanship of King Fahd.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For the King of Saudi Arabia it was a brutal
snub, delivered within a culture that prides itself on elaborate courtesy. King
Fahd, who conceals a shrewd political brain behind an unfailingly gracious
persona, was not pleased.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This was one of the two factors that blew away
the Jeddah conference. The other was the fact that the Saudi monarch had been
shown American photographs taken from space that proved that the Iraqi Army,
far from halting its advance, was still in full battle order and moving south
toward the Saudi border on the southern fringes of Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Would the Iraqis really dare to sweep on and
invade Saudi Arabia itself? The arithmetic added up. Saudi Arabia has the
biggest oil reserves in the world. Second comes Kuwait, with over a hundred
years of reserves at present production levels. Third is Iraq. By taking
Kuwait, Saddam Hussein had reversed the balance. Moreover, ninety percent of
Saudi oil wells and reserves are locked into the far northeastern corner of the
Kingdom, around Dhahran, Al-Khobar, Dammam, and Jubail, and inland from these
ports. The triangle lay right in the path of the advancing Republican Guard
divisions, and the photos proved that more divisions were pouring into Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Fortunately, His Majesty never discovered that
the photos had been doctored. The divisions close to the border were digging
in, but the bulldozers that made this evident had been airbrushed out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On August 6 the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
formally asked U.S. forces to enter the Kingdom for its defense.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first squadrons of fighter-bombers left for
the Middle East the same day. Desert Shield had begun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Brigadier Hassan Rahmani jumped out of his staff car and
ran up the steps of the Hilton Hotel, which had quickly been taken over as the
headquarters of the Iraqi security forces in occupied Kuwait. It amused him, as
he swung through the glass doors into the lobby that morning of August 4, that
the Hilton was right next to the American embassy, both on the seashore with
lovely views over the glittering blue waters of the Arabian Gulf.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The view was all that the staff of the embassy
were going to get for a while—at his suggestion the building had been
immediately ringed with Republican Guards and would stay that way. He could not
prevent foreign diplomats from transmitting messages from inside their
sovereign territory to their governments back home, and he knew he did not have
the supercomputers needed to break the more sophisticated codes that the
British and Americans would be using. But as head of Counterintelligence for the
Mukhabarat, he could ensure they had little of interest to send home by
confining their observations to the views from their windows.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That left, of course, the possibility of their
obtaining information from fellow nationals still at large in Kuwait by telephone.
Another top priority: Ensure that all outside telephone lines were cut or
tapped—tapped would be better, but most of his best men were fully engaged back
in Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He swung into the suite of rooms that had been
set aside for the Counterintelligence team, took off his Army jacket, tossed it
to the sweating aide who had brought up his two suitcases of documents, and
walked to the window to gaze down into the pool of the Hilton Marina. A nice
idea to have a swim later, he thought, then noticed that two soldiers were
filling their water bottles from it and that two more were peeing into it. He
sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At thirty-seven, Rahmani was a trim, handsome,
clean-shaven man—he could not be bothered with the affectation of a Saddam
Hussein—like moustache. He was where he was, and he knew it, because he was
good at his job, not because of political clout; he was a technocrat in a world
of politically elevated cretins.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Why, he had been asked by foreign friends, do
you serve this regime? The question was usually asked when he had got them partly
drunk at the bar of the Rashid Hotel or in a more private place. He was allowed
to mix with them because it was part of his job. But every time he remained
quite sober. He had no objection to liquor on religious grounds—he just ordered
a gin and tonic, but he made sure the bartender knew to give him only tonic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So he smiled at the question and shrugged and
replied: I am an Iraqi and proud of it; which government would you have me
serve?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Privately, he knew perfectly well why he served
a regime most of whose luminaries he privately despised. If he had any emotion
in him, which he frequently claimed he did not, then it came out in a genuine
affection for his country and its people, the ordinary people whom the Ba’ath
Party had long ceased to represent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the principal reason was that he wanted to
get on in life. For an Iraqi of his generation there were few options. He could
oppose the regime and quit, to earn a hand-to-mouth living abroad dodging the
hit squads and making pennies translating from Arabic into English and back, or
he could stay inside Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That left three alternatives. Oppose the regime
again, and end up in one of the torture chambers of that animal Omar Khatib, a
creature he personally loathed in the full knowledge that the feeling was
mutual; or try to survive as a free-lance businessman in an economy that was
being systematically run into the ground; or keep smiling at the idiots and
rise within their ranks through brains and talent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He could see nothing wrong with the latter.
Like Reinhard Gehlen, who served first Hitler, then the Americans, and then the
West Germans; like Marcus Wolf, who served the East German Communists without
believing a word they said, he was a chess player. He lived for the game, the intricate
moves of spy and counterspy. Iraq was his personal chessboard. He knew that
other professionals the world over could understand that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hassan Rahmani returned from the window, sat in
the chair behind the desk, and began to make notes. There was one hell of a lot
to do if Kuwait were ever to be even reasonably secure as the nineteenth
province of Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His first problem was that he did not know how
long Saddam Hussein intended to stay in Kuwait. He doubted the man knew
himself. There was no point in mounting a huge counterintelligence operation,
sealing all the leaks and security holes that he could, if Iraq was going to
pull out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Privately, he believed Saddam could get away
with it. But it would mean boxing cleverly, making the right moves, saying the
right things. The first ploy had to be to attend that conference tomorrow in
Jeddah, to flatter King Fahd until he could take no more, to claim Iraq wanted
no more than a just treaty over oil, Gulf access, and the outstanding loan, and
he would go home to Baghdad. That way, keeping the whole thing in Arab hands
and at all costs keeping the Americans and the Brits out, Saddam could rely on
the Arab preference to keep talking until hell freezes over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The West, with its attention span of a few
weeks, would get fed up and leave it to the four Arabs—two kings and two presidents—and
so long as the oil kept flowing to create the smog that was choking them, the
Anglo-Saxons would stay happy. Unless Kuwait was savagely brutalized, the media
would drop the subject, the Al Sabah regime would be forgotten in exile
somewhere in Saudi Arabia, the Kuwaitis would get on with their lives under a
new government, and the quit-Kuwait conference could chew words for a decade
until it didn’t matter anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It could be done, but it would need the right
touch. Hitler’s touch—“I only seek a peaceful settlement to my just demands.
This is absolutely my last territorial ambition.” King Fahd would fall for it—no
one had any love for the Kuwaitis anyway, let alone the Al Sabah lotus-eaters.
King Fahd and King Hussein would drop them, as Chamberlain had dropped the
Czechs in 1938.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The trouble was, although Saddam was
street-smart as hell or he wouldn’t still be alive, strategically and
diplomatically he was a buffoon. Somehow, Hassan Rahmani reasoned, the Rais
would get it wrong; he would neither pull out nor roll on, seize the Saudi oil
field, and present the Western world with a fait accompli that they could do
nothing about except destroy the oil and their own prosperity for a generation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The West” meant the Americans, with the Brits
at their side, and they were all Anglo-Saxons. He knew about Anglo-Saxons. Five
years at Mr. Hartley’s Tasisiya prep school had taught him his perfect English,
his understanding of the British, and his wariness of that Anglo-Saxon habit of
giving you a very hard punch on the jaw without warning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He rubbed his chin where he had collected such
a punch long ago, and laughed out loud. His aide across the room jumped a foot.
Mike bloody Martin, where are you now?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hassan Rahmani—clever, cultured, cosmopolitan,
educated, and refined, an upper-class scion who served a regime of thugs—bent
to his task. It was quite a task. Of the 1.8 million people in Kuwait that
August, only 600,000 were Kuwaitis. To them you could add 600,000 Palestinians,
some of whom would stay loyal to Kuwait, some of whom would side with Iraq
because the PLO had done so, and most of whom would keep their heads down and
try to survive. Then 300,000 Egyptians, some of them no doubt working for Cairo,
which nowadays was the same as working for Washington or London, and 250,000
Pakistanis, Indians, Bangladeshis, and Filipinos, mainly blue-collar laborers
or domestic servants—as an Iraqi, he believed the Kuwaitis could not scratch a
fleabite on their arse without summoning a foreign servant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And then 50,000 First World citizens—Brits,
Americans, French, Germans, Spanish, Swedes, Danes—name it. And he was supposed
to suppress foreign espionage. ... He sighed for the days when messages meant
messengers or telephones. As head of Counterintelligence, he could seal the
borders and cut the phone lines. But now any fool with a satellite could punch
numbers into a cellular phone or a computer modem and talk to California. Hard
to intercept or track the source, except with the best equipment, which he did
not have.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He knew he could not control the outflow of
information or the steady dribble of refugees escaping over the border. Nor
could he affect the overflights of American satellites, all of which he
suspected had now been reprogrammed to swing their orbits over Kuwait and Iraq
every few minutes. (He was right.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was no point in attempting the
impossible, even though he would have to pretend he had, and had succeeded. The
main target would have to be to prevent active sabotage, the actual killing of
Iraqis and destruction of their equipment, and the formation of a real
resistance movement. And he would have to prevent help from outside, in the
form of men, know-how, or equipment, from reaching any resistance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In this he would come up against his rivals of
the AMAM, the Secret Police, who were installed two floors below him. Khatib,
he had learned that morning, was installing that thug Sabaawi, an oaf as brutal
as himself, as head of the AMAM in Kuwait. If resisting Kuwaitis fell into <i>their</i>
hands, they would learn to scream as loudly as dissidents back home. So he,
Rahmani, would just stick to the foreigners. That was his brief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That morning, Dr. Terry Martin finished his lecture at the
School of Oriental and African Studies, a faculty of London University off
Gower Street, shortly before noon and retired to the senior staff common room.
Just outside the door, he ran into Mabel, the secretary he shared with two
other senior lecturers in Arabic studies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, Dr. Martin, there’s been a message for
you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She fumbled in her attaché case, propping it up
on one tweed-skirted knee, and produced a slip of paper.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This gentleman rang for you. He said it was
rather urgent if you could call him back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside the common room Martin dumped his
lecture notes on the Abassid Caliphate and used a pay phone on the wall. The
number answered on the second ring, and a bright female voice just repeated the
number back. No company name, just the number.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Is Mr. Stephen Laing there?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“May I say who is calling?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Er—Dr. Martin. Terry Martin. He called me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah, yes, Dr. Martin. Would you hold on?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin frowned. She knew about the call, knew
his name. For the life of him, he could not recall any Stephen Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A man came on the phone. “Steve Laing here.
Look, it’s <i>awfully</i> good of you to call back so promptly. I know it’s
incredibly short notice, but we met some time ago at the Institute for
Strategic Studies. Just after you gave that brilliant paper on the Iraqi
arms-procurement machine. I was wondering what you’re doing for lunch.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing, whoever he was, had adopted that mode of
self-expression that is at once diffident and persuasive, hard to turn down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Today? Now?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Unless you have anything fixed. What had you
in mind?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sandwiches in the canteen,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Couldn’t possibly offer you a decent sole
meunière at Scott’s, could I? You know it, of course. Mount Street.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin knew of it, one of the best and most
expensive fish restaurants in London. Twenty minutes away by cab. It was
half-past twelve. And he loved fish. And Scott’s was way beyond his academic
salary. Did Laing by any chance know these things?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Are you actually with the ISS?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Explain over lunch, doctor. Say one o’clock.
Looking forward to it.” The phone went down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When Martin entered the restaurant, the
headwaiter came forward to greet him personally.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dr. Martin? Mr. Laing is at his table. Please
follow me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a quiet table in a corner, very
discreet. One could talk unoverheard. Laing, whom by now Martin was sure he had
never met, rose to greet him, a bony man in dark suit and sober tie with
thinning gray hair. He ushered his guest to a seat and gestured with a raised
eyebrow to a bottle of fine chilled Meursault that sat in the ice bucket.
Martin nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re not with the Institute, are you, Mr.
Laing?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing was not in the least fazed. He watched
the crisp cool liquid poured and the waiter move away, leaving them a menu
each. He raised his glass to his guest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Century House, actually. Does that bother you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The British Secret Intelligence Service works
out of Century House, a rather shabby building south of the Thames between the
Elephant and Castle and the Old Kent Road. It is not a new building and not
really up to the job it is supposed to do and so labyrinthine inside that
visitors really do not need their security passes; within seconds, they get
lost and end up screaming for mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, just interested,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Actually, it’s we who are interested. I’m
quite a fan of yours. I try to keep abreast, but I’m not as clued up as you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I find that hard to believe,” said Martin, but
he was flattered. When an academic is told he is admired, it is pleasing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Quite true,” insisted Laing. “Sole for two?
Excellent. I hope I have read all your papers delivered to the Institute, and
the United Services people and Chatham. Plus, of course, those two articles in <i>Survival</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Over the previous five years, despite his youth
at only thirty-five, Dr. Martin had become more and more in demand as a speaker
presenting erudite papers to such establishments as the Institute for Strategic
Studies, the United Services Institute, and that other body for the intensive
study of foreign affairs, Chatham House. <i>Survival</i> is the magazine of the
ISS, and of each issue twenty-five copies go automatically to the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office in King Charles Street, of which five filter down to
Century House.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin’s interest for these people was
not because of his scholastic excellence in medieval Mesopotamia, but for the
second hat he wore. Quite as a private interest, he had begun years earlier to
study the armed forces of the Middle East, attending defense exhibitions and
cultivating friendships among manufacturers and their Arab clients, where his
fluent Arabic had made him many contacts. After ten years he was a walking
encyclopedia in his chosen pastime subject and was listened to with respect by
the top professionals, much as the American novelist Tom Clancy is regarded as
a world expert on the defense equipment of NATO and the former Warsaw Pact.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two soles meunière arrived, and they began
to eat with appreciation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eight weeks earlier Laing, who was at that time
Director of Operations for the Mid-East Division at Century House, had called
up a pen portrait of Terry Martin from the Research people. He had been
impressed with what he saw.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Born in Baghdad, raised in Iraq, then schooled
in England, Martin had left Haileybury with three advanced levels, all with
distinction, in English, history, and French. Haileybury had had him down as a
brilliant scholar, destined for a scholarship to Oxford or Cambridge.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the boy, already a fluent Arab speaker,
wanted to go on to Arabic studies, so he had applied as a graduate to the
School of Oriental and African Studies in London, attending the spring
interview of 1973. Accepted at once, he had joined in the autumn term of 1973,
studying history of the Middle East.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He walked through a first-class degree in three
years and then put in a further three years for his doctorate, specializing in
Iraq of the eighth to fifteenth centuries, with particular reference to the
Abassid Caliphate from <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.D. </span>750 to 1258.
He took his Ph.D. in 1979, then one year off for a sabbatical—he had been in
Iraq in 1980 when Iraq invaded Iran, triggering the eight-year war, and this
experience began his interest in Middle Eastern military forces.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On his return he was offered a lectureship at
the age of only twenty-six, a signal honor at the SOAS, which happens to be one
of the best and therefore one of the toughest schools of Arabic learning in the
world. He was promoted to a readership in recognition of his excellence in
original research, and he became a reader in Middle East history at the age of
thirty-four, clearly earmarked for a professorship by the age of forty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So much had Laing read in the written
biography. What interested him even more was the second string, the compendium
of knowledge about Middle Eastern arms arsenals. For years, it had been a
peripheral subject, dwarfed by the cold war, but now ...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s about this Kuwait business,” he said at
last. The remains of the fish had been cleared away. Both men had declined a
dessert. The Meursault had gone down very nicely, and Laing had deftly ensured
that Martin had most of it. Now two vintage ports appeared as if unbidden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“As you may imagine, there’s been a hell of a
flapdoodle going on these past few days.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing was understating the case. The Lady had
returned from Colorado in what the mandarins referred to as her Boadicea mode,
a reference to that ancient British queen who used to chop Romans off at the
knees with the swords sticking out of her chariot wheels if they got in the
way. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was reputed to be drinking of taking to
wearing a steel helmet, and the demands for instant enlightenment had rained
down on the spooks of Century House.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The fact is, we would like to slip someone
into Kuwait to find out exactly what is going on.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Under Iraqi occupation?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m afraid so, since they seem to be in
charge.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So why me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let me be frank,” said Laing, who intended to
be anything but. “We really do need to know what is going on inside. The Iraqi
occupation army—how many, how good, what equipment. Our own nationals—how are
they coping, are they in danger, can they realistically be got out in safety.
We need a man in on the ground. This information is vital. So—someone who
speaks Arabic like an Arab, a Kuwaiti or Iraqi. Now, you spend your life among
Arabic-speakers, far more than I do—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But surely there must be hundreds of Kuwaitis
right here in Britain who could slip back in,” Martin suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing sucked leisurely at a piece of sole that
had stuck between two teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Actually,” he murmured, “one would prefer one
of one’s own people.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A Brit? Who can pass for an Arab, right in the
middle of them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s what we need. I’m afraid we doubt if
there is one.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It must have been the wine, or the port. Terry
Martin was not used to Meursault and port with his lunch. Later, he would
willingly have bitten off his own tongue if he could turn the clock back a few
seconds. But he spoke, and then it was too late.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know one. My brother Mike. He’s a major in
the SAS. He can pass for an Arab.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing hid the stab of excitement that jumped
inside him as he removed the toothpick and the offending morsel of sole.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can he now,” he murmured. “Can he now?”</p>

<b><i><span style='font-size:22.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'><br

<h1><a name="_Toc6942754">Chapter 3</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Steve Laing returned to Century House by cab in a spirit
of some surprise and elation. He had arranged the lunch with the academic
Arabist in the hopes of recruiting him for another task, which he still had in
mind, and had only raised the matter of Kuwait as a conversational ploy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Years of practice had taught him to start with
a question or a request that the target could not fulfill, then move on to the
real matter at hand. The theory was that the expert, stumped by the first
request, would be more amenable for his own self-respect to agreeing to the
second.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dr. Martin’s surprise revelation happened to
answer a query that had already been raised during a high-level conference at
Century the previous day. At the time it had been generally regarded as a
no-hope wish. But if young Dr. Martin were right ... a brother who spoke Arabic
even better than he ... and who was already in the Special Air Service Regiment
and therefore accustomed to the covert life ... interesting, very interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On arrival at Century, Laing marched straight
in on his immediate superior, the Controller Mid-East. After an hour together
they both went upstairs to see one of the two Deputy Chiefs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Secret Intelligence Service, or SIS—also
popularly if inaccurately known as MI-6—remains even in the days of supposed “open”
government a shadowy organization that guards its secrecy. Only in recent years
has a British government formally admitted that it exists at all. And it was as
late as 1991 that the same government publicly named its boss, a move regarded
by most insiders as a foolish and short-sighted one that served no purpose
other than to force that unfortunate gentleman to the unwelcome novelty of
needing bodyguards, paid for at public expense. Such are the futilities of
political correctness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The staff of the SIS are listed in no manual
but appear if at all as civil servants on the lists of a variety of ministries,
mainly the Foreign Office, under whose auspices the Service comes. The budget
appears in no accounts, being squirreled away in the budgets of a dozen
different ministries.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even its shabby headquarters was for years
supposed to be a state secret, until it became plain that any London cab
driver, asked to take a passenger to Century House, would reply, “Oh, you mean
the Spook House, guv?” At this point it was admitted that if London’s cabbies
knew where it was, the KGB might have worked it out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Although much less famous than the CIA,
infinitely smaller and more meanly funded, “the Firm” has earned a solid
reputation among friend and foe for the quality of its “product” (secretly
gathered intelligence). Among the world’s major intelligence agencies, only the
Israeli Mossad is smaller and even more shadowy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man heading the SIS is known quite
officially as the Chief and <i>never</i>, despite endless misnomers in the
press, as the Director-General. It is the sister organization MI-5, or the
Security Service, responsible for counterintelligence within the United Kingdom’s
borders, that has a Director-General.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In-house, the Chief is known as “C,” which
ought to stand for Chief but does not. The first-ever Chief was Admiral Sir
Mansfield Cummings, and the C comes from that long-dead gentleman’s last name.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Under the Chief come two Deputy Chiefs and
under them five Assistant Chiefs. These men rule the five main departments:
Operations (or Ops, who gather the covert information); Intelligence (who
analyze it into a hopefully meaningful picture); Technical (responsible for
false papers, minicameras, secret writing, ultracompact communications, and all
the other bits of metal needed to do something illegal and get away with it in
an unfriendly world); Administration (covering salaries, pensions, staff lists,
budget accountancy, Legal Office, Central Registry, and the like); and Counterintelligence
(which tries to keep the Service clean of hostile penetration by vetting and
checking).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Under Ops come the Controllers, who handle the
globe’s various divisions—Western Hemisphere, Sov Bloc, Africa, Europe,
Mid-East, and Australasia—with a side office for Liaison, which has the
ticklish task of trying to cooperate with “friendly” agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To be frank, it is not quite that tidy (nothing
British is ever <i>quite</i> that tidy), but they seem to muddle through.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That August 1990, the focus of attention was
Mid-East, and particularly the Iraq Desk, upon whom the entire political and
bureaucratic world of Westminster and Whitehall seemed to have descended like a
noisy and unwelcome fan club.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Deputy Chief listened carefully to what the
Controller Mid-East and the Director Ops for that region had to say and nodded
several times. It was, he thought, or might be, an interesting option.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not that no information was coming out
of Kuwait. In the first forty-eight hours, before the Iraqis closed down the
international telephone lines, every British company with an office in Kuwait
had been on the phone, the telex, or the fax machines to their local man. The
Kuwaiti embassy had been bending the ear of the Foreign Office with the first
horror stories and demanding instant liberation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The problem was, virtually none of the
information was of the sort the Chief could present to Cabinet as utterly
reliable. In the aftermath of the invasion, Kuwait was one giant “bugger’s
muddle,” as the Foreign Secretary had so mordantly phrased it six hours
earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even the British embassy staff were now firmly
locked in their compound on the edge of the Gulf, almost in the shadow of the needle-pointed
Kuwait Towers, trying to contact by telephone those British citizens on a
grossly inadequate list to see if they were all right. The received wisdom from
these frightened businessmen and engineers was that they could occasionally
hear gunfire. “Tell me something I <i>don’t</i> know” was the reaction at
Century to such gems of intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now a man in on the ground, and a trained
deep-penetration, covert-ops man who could pass for an Arab—that could be very
interesting. Apart from some rock-hard real information as to what the hell was
going on in there, a chance existed to show the politicians that something was
actually being done and to cause William Webster over at the CIA to choke on
his after-dinner mints.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Deputy Chief had had no illusions about
Margaret Thatcher’s almost kittenish esteem (mutual) for the SAS since that
afternoon in May 1980 when they had blown away those terrorists at the Iranian
embassy in London, and she had spent the evening with the team at the Albany
Street barracks drinking whiskey and listening to their tales of derring-do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think,” he said at last, “I’d better have a
chat with the DSF.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Officially, the Special Air Service Regiment
has nothing to do with the SIS. The chains of command are quite different. The
active-service 22nd SAS (as opposed to the part-time 23rd SAS) is based at a
barracks called Stirling Lines, outside the county town of Hereford in the west
of England. Its commanding officer reports to the Director of Special Forces,
or DSF, whose office is in a sprawl of buildings in West London. The actual
office is at the top of a once-elegant pillared building covered in a seemingly
perpetual skin of scaffolding, part of a rabbit warren of small rooms whose
lack of splendor belies the importance of the operations planned there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The DSF comes under the Director of Military
Operations (a general) who reports to the Chief of General Staff (an even
higher general), and the General Staff comes under the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the <i>Special</i> in the title of the SAS
is there for a reason. Ever since it was founded in the Western Desert of Libya
in 1941 by Colonel David Stirling, the SAS has operated covertly. Its tasks
have always included deep penetration with a view to lying hidden and observing
enemy movements; deep penetration with a view to sabotage, assassination, and
general mayhem; terrorist elimination; hostage recovery; close protection, a
euphemism for bodyguarding the high and mighty; and foreign training missions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Like members of any elite unit, the officers
and men of the SAS tend to live quietly within their own society, unable to
discuss their work with outsiders, refusing to be photographed, and rarely
emerging from the shadows.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because the lifestyles of the members of the
two secret societies had much in common, the SIS and the SAS knew each other at
least by sight and had frequently cooperated in the past, either on joint
operations or with the intelligence people, “borrowing” a specialist soldier
from the regiment for a particular task. It was something of this kind that the
Deputy Chief of the SIS (who had cleared his visit with the Chief, Sir Colin)
had in mind when he took a glass of single malt whiskey from Brigadier J. P.
Lovat in the covert London headquarters that evening as the sun went down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The unwitting object of such discussion and
private musing in London and Kuwait was at that moment poring over a map in
another barracks many miles away. For the past eight weeks, he and his team of
twelve instructors had been living in a section of the quarters assigned to the
private bodyguard unit of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a task the regiment had undertaken many
times before. All up and down the western shore of the Gulf, from the Sultanate
of Oman in the south to Bahrain in the north, lies a chain of sultanates,
emirates, and sheikhdoms in and out of which the British have been pottering
for centuries. The Trucial States, now the United Arab Emirates, were so called
because Britain once signed a truce with their rulers to protect them with the
Royal Navy against marauding pirates in exchange for trading privileges. The
relationship continues, and many of these rulers have princely guard units
trained in the finer points of close protection by visiting SAS instructor
teams. A fee is paid, of course, but to the Ministry of Defence in London.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Major Mike Martin had a large map of the Gulf
and most of the Middle East spread out over the mess hall table and was
studying it, surrounded by several of his men. At thirty-seven, he was not the
oldest man in the room; two of his sergeants topped forty, tough, wiry, and
very fit soldiers whom a man twenty years their junior would have been
extremely foolish to take on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Anything in it for us, boss?” asked one of the
sergeants.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As in all small, tight units, first names are
widely used in the regiment, but officers are normally called “boss” by other
ranks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t know,” said Martin. “Saddam Hussein
has got himself into Kuwait. Question is: Will he get out of his own accord? If
not, will the UN authorize a force to go in and throw him out? If yes, I would
think there ought to be something in there for us to do.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good,” said the sergeant with satisfaction,
and there were nods from the other six around the table. It had been too long,
so far as they were concerned, since they had been on a real, high-adrenaline
combat operation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There are four basic disciplines in the
regiment, and each recruit must master one of them. There are the freefallers,
specializing in high-altitude parachute drops; the mountain-men, whose
preferred terrain is rock faces and the high peaks; the armored scout car men,
who drive and operate stripped-down, heavily armored long-base Land-Rovers over
open terrain; and the amphibians, skilled in canoes, silent-running
inflatables, and subaqua or underwater work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In his team of twelve, Martin had four
freefallers, including himself, four scout car men teaching the Abu Dhabis the
principles of fast attack and counterattack over desert ground, and because Abu
Dhabi lies by the Gulf, four subaqua instructors.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Apart from their own speciality, SAS men must
have a good working knowledge of the other disciplines, so that
inter-changeability is common. They have to master more besides—radio, first
aid, and languages.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The basic combat unit consists of only four
men. If one is ever out of action, his tasks will be quickly shared among the surviving
three, whether they be radio operators or unit medics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They pride themselves on a far higher
educational level than any other unit in the Army, and because they travel the
world, languages are a must. Every soldier must learn one, apart from English.
For years Russian was a favorite, now going out of fashion since the end of the
cold war. Malay is very useful in the Far East, where the regiment for years
fought in Borneo. Spanish is on the increase since the covert operations in
Colombia against the cocaine lords of Medellin and Cali. French is learned—just
in case.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And because the regiment had spent years
assisting Sultan Qaboos of Oman in his war with Communist infiltrators from
South Yemen into the interior of Dhofar, plus other training missions up and
down the Gulf and in Saudi Arabia, many SAS men speak passable Arabic. The
sergeant who had asked for some action was one of them, but he had to admit: “The
boss is bloody amazing. I’ve never heard anyone like him. He even looks the
part.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin straightened and ran a nut-brown
hand through jet-black hair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Time to turn in.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was just after ten. They would be up before
dawn for the usual ten-mile run with their charges before the sun became too
hot. It was a chore the Abu Dhabis loathed but upon which their sheikh
insisted. If these strange soldiers from England said it was good for them, it
was good for them. Besides, he was paying for it, and he wanted value for his
money.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Major Martin retired to his own quarters and
slept quickly and deeply. The sergeant was right; he <i>did </i>look the part.
His men often wondered if he got his olive skin, dark eyes, and deep black hair
from some Mediterranean forebears. He never told them, but they were wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The maternal grandfather of both Martin boys
had been a British tea planter at Darjeeling in India. As kids they had seen
pictures of him—tall, pink-faced, blond-moustached, pipe in mouth, gun in hand,
standing over a shot tiger. Very much the <i>pukka sahib</i>, the Englishman of
the Indian Raj.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then in 1928 Terence Granger had done the
unthinkable: He had fallen in love with and insisted on marrying an Indian
girl. That she was gentle and beautiful was not the point. It was simply not
done. The tea company did not fire him—that would have brought it out in the
open. They sent him into internal exile (that was what they actually called it)
to an isolated plantation in faraway Assam.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If it was supposed to be a punishment, it did
not work. Granger and his new bride, the former Miss Indira Bohse, loved it
there—the wild, ravined countryside teeming with game and tigers, the deep
green tea slopes, the climate, the people. And there Susan was born in 1930.
They raised her there, an Anglo-Indian girl with Indian playmates.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By 1943 war had rolled toward India, with the
Japanese advancing through Burma to the border. Granger was old enough not to
have to volunteer, but he insisted, and after basic training at Delhi he was
posted as a major to the Assam Rifles. All British cadets were promoted
straight to major; they were not supposed to serve <i>under</i> an Indian
officer, but Indians could make lieutenant or captain.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In 1945 he died in the crossing of the
Irrawaddy. His body was never brought back; it vanished in those drenched
Burmese jungles, one of tens of thousands who had seen some of the most vicious
hand-to-hand fighting of the war.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With a small company pension, his widow
retreated back into her own culture. Two years later, more trouble came. India
was being partitioned in 1947. The British were leaving. Ali Jinnah insisted on
his Moslem Pakistan in the north, Pandit Nehru settled for mainly Hindu India
in the south. As waves of refugees of the two religions rolled north and south,
violent fighting broke out. Over a million died. Mrs. Granger, fearful for her
daughter’s safety, sent her to complete her education with her late father’s
younger brother, a very proper architect of Haslemere, Surrey. Six months
later, the mother died in the rioting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So at seventeen Susan Granger came to England,
the land of her fathers that she had never seen. She spent one year at a girls’
school near Haslemere and then two years as a trainee nurse at Farnham General
Hospital, followed by one more as a secretary to a Farnham solicitor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At twenty-one, the youngest permitted age, she
applied as a stewardess with the British Overseas Airways Corporation. She
trained with the other girls at the BOAC school, the old converted St. Mary’s
Convent at Heston, just outside London. Her nursing training was the clincher,
and her looks and manner an added plus.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At twenty-one she was beautiful, with tumbling
chestnut hair, hazel eyes, and skin like a European with a permanent golden
suntan. On graduation she was assigned to Number 1 Line, London to India—an
obvious choice for a girl speaking fluent Hindi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a long, long trip in those days aboard
the four-propeller Argonaut. The route was
London-Rome-Cairo-Basra-Bahrain-Karachi-Bombay. Then on to Delhi, Calcutta, Colombo,
Rangoon, Bangkok, and finally Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Of course, one
crew could not do it all, and the first crew stopover was Basra in the south of
Iraq, where another crew took over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was there in 1951, over a drink at the Port
Club, that she met a rather shy young accountant with the Iraq Petroleum
Company, then owned and run by the British. His name was Nigel Martin, and he
asked her to dinner. She had been warned about wolves—among the passengers, the
crew, and during the stopovers. But he seemed nice, so she accepted. When he
took her back to the BOAC station house, where the stewardesses were quartered,
he held out his hand. She was so surprised, she shook it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then she lay awake in the awful heat wondering
what it would be like to kiss Nigel Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On her next stopover in Basra, he was there
again. Only after they were married did he admit he had been so smitten that he
found out through the BOAC Station Officer Alex Reid when she was due next.
That autumn of 1951 they played tennis, swam at the Port Club, and walked
through the bazaars of Basra. At his suggestion she took a leave and came with
him to Baghdad, where he was based.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She soon realized it was a place where she
could settle down. The swarming throngs of brightly colored robes, the sights
and smells of the street, the cooking meats by the edge of the Tigris, the
myriad little shops selling herbs and spices, gold, and jewels—all reminded her
of her native India. When he proposed to her, she accepted at once.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They married in. 1952 at St. George’s
Cathedral, the Anglican church off Haifa Street, and although she had no one on
her side of the church, many people came from the IPC and the embassy to fill
both rows of pews.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a good time to live in Baghdad. Life was
slow and easy, the boy king Faisal was on the throne with Nuri as Said running
the country, and the overwhelming foreign influence was British. This was
partly because of the powerful contribution of the IPC to the economy and
partly because most of the Army officers were British-taught, but mainly
because the entire upper class had been potty-trained by starched English
nannies, which always leaves a lasting impression.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In time the Martins had two sons, born in 1953
and 1955. Christened Michael and Terry, they were as unlike as chalk and
cheese. In Michael the genes of Miss Indira Bohse came through; he was
black-haired, dark-eyed, and olive-skinned; wags from the British community
said he looked more like an Arab. Terry, two years younger, took after his
father: short, stocky, pink-skinned, and ginger-haired.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At three in the morning, Major Mike Martin was
shaken awake by an orderly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There is a message, <i>sayidi</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was quite a simple message, but the urgency
coding was “blitz,” and the signoff meant it came personally from the Director
of Special Forces. It required no answer. It just ordered him back to London on
the first available plane.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He handed over his duties to the SAS captain,
who was on his first tour with the regiment and was his second-in-command for
the training assignment, and raced to the airport in civilian clothes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The 2:55 <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>
for London should have left. Over a hundred passengers snored or grumbled on
board as the stewardess brightly announced that the operational reason for the
ninety-minute delay would soon be sorted out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the doors opened again to admit a single,
lean man in jeans, desert boots, shirt, and bomber jacket with a tote bag over
one shoulder, a number of those still awake glared at him. The man was shown to
an empty seat in business class, made himself comfortable, and within minutes
of takeoff tilted back his seat and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A businessman next to him who had dined
copiously and with much illicit liquid refreshment, then waited two hours in
the airport and two more on the plane, fed himself another antacid tablet and
glowered at the relaxed, sleeping figure beside him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody Arab,” he muttered, and tried in vain
to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dawn came over the Gulf two hours later, but
the British Airways jet was racing it toward the northwest, landing at Heathrow
just before ten local time. Mike Martin came out of the customs hall among the
first because he had no baggage in the aircraft hold. There was no one to meet
him; he knew there would not be. He also knew where to go.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was not even dawn in Washington, but the first
indications of the coming sun pinked the distant hills of Prince Georges
County, where the Patuxent River flows down to join the Chesapeake. On the
sixth and top floor of the big, oblong building among the cluster that forms
the headquarters of the CIA and is known simply as Langley, the lights still
burned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Judge William Webster, the Director of Central
Intelligence, rubbed fingertips over tired eyes, rose, and walked to the
picture windows. The swath of silver birches that masked his view of the
Potomac when they were in full leaf, as they were now, still lay shrouded in
darkness. Within an hour the rising sun would bring them back to pale green. It
had been another sleepless night. Since the invasion of Kuwait he had been
catnapping between calls from the President, the National Security Council, the
State Department, and so it seemed, just about anyone else who had his number.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Behind him, as tired as he, sat Bill Stewart,
his Deputy Director (Operations), and Chip Barber, head of the Middle East
Division.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So that’s about it?” asked the DCI, as if
asking the question again might produce a better answer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But there was no change. The position was that
the President, the NSC, and State were all clamoring for deep-mined hypersecret
intelligence from inside the heart of Baghdad, from the innermost councils of
Saddam Hussein himself. Was he going to stay in Kuwait? Would he pull out under
threat of the United Nations resolutions that were rolling out of the Security
Council? Would he buckle in the face of the oil embargo and the trade blockade?
What was he thinking? What was he planning? Damn it, where was he anyway?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And the Agency did not know. They had a Head of
Station in Baghdad, of course. But the man had been frozen out for weeks past.
The Agency man was known to that bastard Rahmani who headed Iraqi
Counterintelligence, and it was now plain that what had been fed to the Head of
Station for weeks had all been bullshit. His best “sources” were apparently
working for Rahmani and had been telling him trash.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Of course, they had the pictures—enough
pictures to drown in. The satellites, KH-11 and KH-12, were rolling over Iraq
every few minutes taking happy snapshots of everything in the entire country.
Analysts were working around the clock identifying what <i>might</i> be a
poison gas factory, what <i>might</i> be a nuclear facility—or might be what it
claimed to be, a bicycle workshop.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Fine. The analysts of the National
Reconnaissance Office, a part-CIA and part-Air Force enterprise, along with the
scientists at ENPIC, the National Photographic Interpretation Center, were
putting together a picture that would one day be complete. This here is a major
command post, this is a SAM missile site, this is a fighter base. Good, because
the pictures tell us so. And one day, maybe, they would all have to be bombed
back to the Stone Age. But what <i>else</i> did Saddam have? Hidden away,
stashed deep underground?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Years of neglect of Iraq were now bearing
fruit. The men who were slumped in their chairs behind Webster were old-time
spooks who had made their bones on the Berlin wall when the concrete was not
even dry. They went back a long way, before electronics had taken over the
business of intelligence-gathering.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And they had told him that the cameras of the NRO
and the listening ears of the National Security Agency over at Fort Meade could
not reveal plans, they could not spy out intentions, they could not go inside a
dictator’s head.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So the NRO was taking pictures and the ears of
Fort Meade were listening and taping every word on every telephone call and
radio message into, out of, and inside Iraq. And still he had no answers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The same administration, the same Capitol Hill
that had been so mesmerized with electronic gadgetry that they had spent
billions of dollars developing and sending up every last gizmo that the
ingenious mind of man could devise, were now clamoring for answers that the
gizmos did not seem to be giving them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And the men behind the DCI were saying that
elint, the name for electronic intelligence, was a backup and a supplement to
humint, or human intelligence-gathering, but not a substitute for it. Which was
nice to know, but no solution to his problem.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Which was that the White House was demanding
answers that could only be given with authority by a source, an asset, a spook,
a spy, a traitor, whatever, placed high inside the Iraqi hierarchy. <i>Which he
did not have</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’ve asked Century House?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. Same as us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m going to Tel Aviv in two days,” said Chip
Barber. “I’ll be seeing Yaacov Dror. Shall I ask him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The DCI nodded. General Yaacov “Kobi” Dror was
the head of the Mossad, most uncooperative of all the “friendly” agencies. The
DCI was still smarting over the case of Jonathan Pollard, who had been run by
the Mossad right inside America against the United States. Some friends. He
hated to ask the Mossad for favors.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Lean on him, Chip. We are not messing around
here. If he has a source inside Baghdad, we want in. We need that product.
Meanwhile, I’d better go back to the White House and face Scowcroft again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On that unhelpful note, the meeting ended.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The four men who waited at the SIS London headquarters
that morning of August 5 had been busy most of the night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Director of Special Forces, Brigadier J. P.
Lovat, had been on the phone for most of it, allowing himself a two-hour catnap
in his chair between two and four <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>
Like so many combat soldiers, he had long since developed the knack of grabbing
a few hours whenever and wherever a situation permitted. One never knew how
long it might be until the next chance to recharge the batteries. Before dawn,
he had washed and shaved and was ready to go on for another day running on all
cylinders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was his call to a contact high in British
Airways at midnight (London time) that had held the airliner on the ground at
Abu Dhabi. The British Airways executive, roused at his home, did not ask why
he should hold an airliner three thousand miles away until an extra passenger
could board it. He knew Lovat because they were members of the Special Forces
Club in Herbert Crescent, knew roughly what he did, and fulfilled the favor
without asking why.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the breakfast hour the orderly sergeant had
checked with Heathrow that the Abu Dhabi flight had made up a third of its
ninety-minute delay and would land about ten. The major should be at the
barracks close to eleven.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A motorcycle messenger had rushed up a certain
personal career file from Browning Barracks, headquarters of the Parachute
Regiment at Aldershot. The regimental adjutant had pulled it out of Records
just after midnight. It was the file that covered Mike Martin’s career in the
Paras from the day he presented himself as an eighteen-year-old schoolboy
through all the nineteen years he had been a professional soldier, except the
two long periods he had spent on transfer to the SAS Regiment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The commanding officer of the 22nd SAS, Colonel
Bruce Craig, another Scot, had driven through the night from Hereford, bringing
with him the file that covered those two periods. He strode in just before
dawn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Morning, J.P. What’s the flap?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They knew each other well. Lovat, always known
as J.P. or Jaypee, had been the man in command of the squad that had retaken
the Iranian embassy in London from the terrorists ten years earlier, and Craig
had been a troop commander under him at the time. They went back a long way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Century wants to put a man into Kuwait,” he
said. That seemed to be enough. Long speeches were not his passion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“One of ours? Martin?” Colonel Craig tossed
down the file he had brought.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Looks like it. I’ve called him back from Abu
Dhabi.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, fuck them. You going to go along with
it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin was one of Craig’s officers, and
they too went back a long way. He did not like his men being pinched from under
his nose by Century House. The DSF shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“May have to. If he fits. If they feel like it,
they’ll probably go very high.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Craig grunted and took a strong black coffee
from the orderly sergeant whom he greeted as Sid—they had fought in Dhofar
together. When it came to politics, the colonel knew the score. The SIS might
act diffident, but when they wanted to pull strings they could go as high as
they liked. Century House would probably win on this one if it wanted to. The
regiment would have to cooperate, even though Century would have overall control
under the guise of a joint mission.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two men from Century arrived just after the
colonel, and they were all introduced. The senior man was Steve Laing. He had
brought with him Simon Paxman, head of the Iraq Desk. They were seated in a
waiting room, given coffee, and offered the two CV files to read. Both men
buried themselves in the background of Mike Martin from the age of eighteen
onward. The previous evening, Paxman had spent four hours with the younger
brother learning about the family background and upbringing in Baghdad and
Haileybury public school.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had written a personal letter to the
Paras during his last term at Haileybury in the summer of 1971 and been offered
an interview that September at the depot in Aldershot. He had been regarded by
his school as a moderate scholar but a superb athlete. That suited the Paras
just fine. The boy was accepted and began training the same month, a grueling
twenty-two weeks that brought the survivors of the course to April 1972.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>First there had been four weeks of
square-bashing, basic weapons handling, basic fieldcraft, and physical fitness;
then two more of the same plus first aid, signals, and study of precautions
against NBC—nuclear, bacteriological, and chemical warfare.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The seventh week was for more fitness training,
getting harder all the time, but not as bad as weeks eight and nine—endurance
marches through the Brecon range in Wales, where strong and fit men have died
of exposure, hypothermia, and exhaustion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Week ten saw the course at Hythe, Kent, for
shooting on the range, where Martin, just turned nineteen, rated as a marksman.
Eleven and twelve were test weeks carried out in open country near Aldershot—just
running up and down sandy hills carrying tree trunks in the mud, rain, and
freezing hail of midwinter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Test weeks?” muttered Paxman, turning the
page. “What the hell has the rest been?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After the test weeks, the young men got their
coveted red beret and paratrooper smocks before three more weeks in the Brecons
for defense exercise, patrolling, and live firing exercise. By then—it was late
January—the Brecons were utterly bleak and freezing. The men slept rough and
wet without fires.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Weeks sixteen to nineteen were for the basic
parachute course at RAF Abingdon, where a few more dropped out, and not just
from the aircraft.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After two more weeks devoted to a field
exercise called last fence and some polishing of parade-ground drill skills,
week twenty-two saw Pass-out Parade, with proud parents at last allowed to see
the youths who had left them six months earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Private Mike Martin had long been earmarked as
POM—potential officer material—and in May 1972 he went to Royal Military
Academy Sandhurst, joining the one-year standard military course. In the spring
of 1973, the new Lieutenant Martin went straight to Hythe to take over a
platoon in preparatory training for Northern Ireland, and he commanded the
platoon during twelve miserable weeks crouching in an observation post called
Flax Mill that covered the ultra-Republican enclave of Ardoyne, Belfast. He had
been assigned to the Third Battalion, known as Three Para, and after Belfast
returned to the depot at Aldershot to command the recruit platoon, putting
newcomers through the same purgatory he himself had endured. In the summer of
1977 he returned to Three Para, now based at Osnabrück as part of the British
Army of the Rhine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was another miserable time. The Paras were
assigned to “penguin mode,” meaning that for three years out of every nine, or
one tour out of three, they were off parachuting and used as ordinary
lorry-borne infantry. All Paras hate penguin mode. Morale was low, fights broke
out between the Paras and the Infantry, and Martin had to punish men with whom
he thoroughly sympathized. He stuck it out for nearly a year, then in November
1977 he volunteered for transfer to the SAS.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A good proportion of the SAS come from the
Paras, perhaps because the training has similarities, though the SAS claim
theirs is harder, that they take very fit men and then start to work on them.
Martin’s papers went through the regiment’s Records Office at Hereford, where
his fluent Arabic was noted, and in the summer of 1978 Martin did the standard “initial”
selection course of six weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the first day a smiling instructor told them
all:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“On this course, we don’t try and train you. We
try and kill you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They did too. Only ten percent pass the initial
course into the SAS. It saves time later. Martin passed. Then came continuation
training, jungle training in Belize, and one extra month back in England devoted
to resistance to interrogation. <i>Resistance </i>means trying to stay silent
while some extremely unpleasant practices are inflicted. The good news is that
both the regiment and the volunteer have the right every hour to insist on an
RTU—return to unit—for the volunteer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They’re mad,” said Paxman, throwing down the
file and helping himself to another coffee. “They’re all bloody mad.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing grunted. He was engrossed in the second
file; it was the man’s experience in Arabia that he needed for the mission he had
in mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had spent three years with the SAS on
his first tour, with the rank of captain and role of troop commander. He had
opted for A Squadron, the freefallers—the squadrons are A, B, C, and G—which
was a natural choice for a man who had jumped while in the Paras with their
high-altitude freefall display team, the Red Devils.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the Paras had no cause to use his Arabic,
the Regiment did. In the three years 1979-1981 he had served alongside the
Sultan of Oman’s forces in western Dhofar, taught VIP protection in two Gulf
emirates, taught the Saudi National Guard in Riyadh, and lectured the private
bodyguards of Sheikh Isa of Bahrain. There were notations after these listings
in his SAS file: that he had redeveloped a strong boyhood bond with Arab culture,
that he spoke the language like no other officer in the regiment, and that he
had a habit of going for long walks in the desert when he wanted to think a
problem through, impervious to the heat and the flies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The record showed he returned to the Paras
after his three-year secondment to the SAS in the winter of ’81 and found to
his joy that the Paras were taking part in Operation Rocky Lance during January
and February 1982 in, of all places, Oman. So he came back to the Jebel Akdar
for that period, before taking leave in March. In April he was hastily recalled—Argentina
had invaded the Falklands. Paras Two and Three went to the South Atlantic. They
sailed on the liner <i>Canberra</i>, which had been hastily converted for
military troopship use, and went ashore at San Carlos Water. Three Para tabbed
right across East Falkland in the sleet and rain toward Port Stanley. Tabbing
meant force-marching in foul conditions while carrying 120 pounds of gear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Three Para headquartered themselves at a lonely
farm called Estancia House and prepared for the last assault on Port Stanley,
which meant first taking the heavily defended Mount Longdon. It was in that
vicious night of June 11 that Captain Mike Martin collected his bullet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It started as a silent night attack on the
Argentine positions and turned very noisy when Corporal Milne stepped on a mine
that blew his foot off. The Argentine machine guns opened up, the flares lit
the mountain like day, and Three Para could either run back to cover or into
the fire and take Longdon. They took Longdon, with twenty-three dead and more
than forty injured. One of these was Mike Martin, who nursed a slug through one
leg and gave vent to a hissed stream of foul invective, fortunately in Arabic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After most of the day on the mountainside, he
was brought out to the advanced dressing station at Ajax Bay, patched up, and
helicoptered to the hospital ship <i>Uganda</i>. The <i>Uganda</i> stopped in
Montevideo, and Martin was among those fit enough to fly home by civilian
airliner to Brize Norton. The Paras then gave him three weeks at Headley Court,
Leather-head, for convalescence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That was where he met the nurse, Lucinda, who
was to become his wife after a brief courtship. Perhaps she liked the glamour
of a husband in the Paras, but she was mistaken. They set up housekeeping in a
cottage near Chobham, convenient for her job at Leatherhead and his at
Aldershot. But after three years, having actually seen him for four and a half
months, Lucinda quite properly put to him a choice: you can have the Paras and
your bloody desert, or you can have me. He thought it over and chose the
desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was quite right to go. In the autumn of
1982 he had studied for Staff College, gateway to senior rank and a nice desk,
perhaps in the Ministry. In February 1983 he fluffed the exam.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He did it deliberately,” said Paxman. “His CO’s
note here says he could have breezed through if he wanted.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know,” said Laing. “I’ve read it. The man’s ...
unusual.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the summer of 1983 Martin was posted to the
job of British staff officer assigned to the Sultan of Oman’s Land Forces HQ at
Muscat. He went straight into two more years secondment, keeping his Para badge
but commanding the Northern Frontier Regiment, Muscat. He was promoted to major
in Oman in the summer of ’86.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Officers who have served one tour in the SAS
can come back for a second, but only on invitation. Hardly had he landed back
in England in the winter of ’87, when his uncontested divorce went through,
than the invitation came from Hereford. He went back as a squadron commander in
January ’88, serving with Northern Flank (Norway), then with the Sultan of
Brunei and six months with the internal security team at Stirling Lines at
Hereford. In June 1990 he was sent with his team of instructors to Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sergeant Sid knocked and poked his head around
the door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The brigadier asks if you’d care to rejoin
him. Major Martin is on his way up.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When Martin walked in, Laing noted the
sun-darkened face, hair, and eyes and shot a glance at Paxman. One down, two to
go. He looked the part. Now, would he do it, and could he speak Arabic as they
said?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>J.P. walked forward and took Martin’s hand in
his bone-crushing grip.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good to see you back, Mike.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you, sir.” He shook hands with Colonel
Craig.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let me introduce these two gentlemen,” said
the DSF. “Mr. Laing and Mr. Paxman, both from Century. They have a—er—proposition
they would like to put to you. Gentlemen, fire ahead. Would you prefer to have
Major Martin in private?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, no, please,” said Laing hastily. “The
Chief is hoping that if anything results from this meeting, it will definitely
be a joint operation.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nice touch, thought J.P., mentioning Sir Colin.
Just to show how much clout these bastards intend to exercise if they have to.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All five sat down. Laing talked, explaining the
political background, the uncertainty as to whether Saddam Hussein would get
out of Kuwait quickly, slowly, or not at all unless thrown out. But the
political analysis was that Iraq would first strip Kuwait of every valuable,
then stick around demanding concessions that the United Nations was simply not
in a mood to concede. One might be looking at months and months.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Britain needed to know what was going on inside
Kuwait—not gossip and rumor, nor the lurid stories flying around the media, but
rock-hard information: about the British citizens still stuck there, about the
occupation forces, and if force had eventually to be used, whether a Kuwaiti
resistance could be useful in pinning down more and more of Saddam’s otherwise
frontline troops.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin nodded and listened and asked a few
pertinent questions but otherwise stayed silent. The two senior officers gazed
out the window. Laing concluded just after twelve.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s about it, Major. I don’t expect an
answer immediately, right now, but time is of the essence.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do you mind if we have a few words with our
colleague in private?” asked J.P.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course not. Look, Simon and I will trot
back to the office. You have my desk number. Perhaps you’d let me know this
afternoon?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sergeant Sid showed the two civilians out and
escorted them down to the street, where he watched them hail a taxi. Then he
climbed back to his aerie under the roof beams behind the scaffolding.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>J.P. went to a small fridge and extracted three
cold beers. When the tabs were off, all three men took a swig.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, Mike, you know what’s what. That’s what
they want. If you think it’s crazy, we’ll go along with that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Absolutely,” said Craig. “In the Regiment you
get no black marks for saying no. This is their idea, not ours.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But if you want to go with them,” said J.P., “walk
through the door, so to speak, then you’re with them till you come back. We’ll
be involved, of course. They probably can’t run it without us. But you’ll be
under them. They’ll be in charge. When it’s over, you come back to us as if you’d
been on leave.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin knew how it worked. He’d heard of others
who had worked for Century. You just ceased to exist for the Regiment until you
came back. Then they all said, “Good to see you again,” and never mentioned or
asked where you had been.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll take it,” he said. Colonel Craig rose. He
had to get back to Hereford. He held out his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good luck, Mike.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“By the way,” said the brigadier, “you have a
lunch date. Just down the street. Century set it up.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He handed Martin a slip of paper and bade him
farewell.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin went back down the stairs. The
paper said his lunch was at a small restaurant four hundred yards away, and his
host was Mr. Wane Al-Khouri.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Apart from MI-S and MI-6 the third major arm of
British intelligence is the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, a
complex of buildings in a guarded compound outside the staid town of Cheltenham
in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>GCHQ is the British version of America’s
National Security Agency, with which it cooperates very closely—the listeners
whose antennae eavesdrop on almost every radio broadcast and telephone,
conversation in the world if they so wish.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Through its cooperation with GCHQ, the American
NSA has a number of outstations inside Britain, apart from its other listening
posts all over the world, and GCHQ has its own overseas stations, notably a
very large one on British sovereign territory at Akrotiri in Cyprus.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Akrotiri station, being closer to the
scene, monitors the Middle East, but it passes all its product back to Cheltenham
for analysis. Among the analysts are a number of experts who, although Arabs by
birth, are cleared to a very high level. Such a one was Mr. Al-Khouri, who had
long before elected to settle in Britain, naturalize, and marry an English
wife.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This genial former Jordanian diplomat now
worked as a senior analyst in the Arabic Service of GCHQ where, even though
there were many British scholars of Arabic, he could often read a meaning
behind the meaning of a taped speech by a leader in the Arab world. It was he
who, at the request of Century, was waiting for Mike Martin at the restaurant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had a convivial lunch that lasted two
hours and spoke nothing but Arabic. When they parted, Martin left and strolled
back toward the SAS building. There would be hours of briefings before he was
ready to leave for Riyadh with a passport he knew Century would by then have
ready, complete with visas in a false name.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before he left the restaurant Mr. Al-Khouri
called a number from the wall phone by the men’s room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No problem, Steve. He’s perfect. In fact, I
don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone like him. It’s not scholar’s Arabic, you
know; it’s even better, from your point of view. Street Arabic, every
swearword, slang, piece of jargon. ... No, not a trace of an accent. ... Yes,
he can pass all right ... on just about any street in the Middle East. No, no,
not at all, old chap. Glad to be of assistance.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Thirty minutes later, Mike Martin had retrieved
his rental car and was on the M4 heading back to Cheltenham. Before he entered
the headquarters, he also made a call, to a number just off Gower Street. The
man he was calling picked up the phone, since it was in his office in the SOAS,
where he was working over papers on an afternoon that called for no lectures.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hullo, bro. It’s me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The soldier had no need to introduce himself.
Since they had been at prep school together in Baghdad, he had always called
his younger brother “bro.” There was a gasp at the other end of the line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mike? Where the hell are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In London, in a phone booth.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I thought you were somewhere in the Gulf.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Got back this morning. Probably leave again
tonight.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, Mike, don’t go. It’s all my fault. ... I
should have kept my bloody mouth shut—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His elder brother’s deep laugh came across the
line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I wondered why the buggers suddenly got
interested in me. Take you to lunch, did they?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, we were talking about something else. It
just cropped up, sort of slipped out. Look, you don’t have to go. Tell them I
was mistaken.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Too late. Anyway, I’ve accepted.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh God. ...” In his office, surrounded by
erudite tomes on medieval Mesopotamia, the younger man was almost in tears.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mike, look after yourself. I’ll pray for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike thought for a moment. Yes, Terry had
always had a touch of religion. He probably would.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You do that, bro. See you when I get back.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He hung up. Alone in his office, the
ginger-haired scholar who hero-worshiped his soldier brother put his head in
his hands.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the British Airways 8:45 <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> flight for Saudi Arabia lifted off from
Heathrow that night, right on time, Mike Martin was on it with a fully visa-ed
passport in another name. He would be met just before dawn by Century’s Head of
Station at the Riyadh embassy.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942755">Chapter 4</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Don Walker eased down on the brake pedal and the ’63
vintage Corvette Stingray paused for a moment at the main entrance to Seymour
Johnson Air Force base to let a couple of campers pass before emerging onto the
highway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was hot. The August sun blasted down up
ahead on the small North Carolina town of Goldsboro so that the tarmac seemed
to shimmer like moving water. It was good to have the top down and feel the
wind, warm though it was, running through his short blond hair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He maneuvered the classic sports car over which
he had lavished so much attention up through the slumbering town to Highway 70,
then pulled onto Highway 13 heading northeast.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker, that hot summer of 1990, was
twenty-nine years old, single, a fighter jockey, and had just learned that he
was going to war. Well, maybe. Apparently it would depend on some weird Arab
called Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That same morning the wing commander, Colonel
(later General) Hal Hornburg, had laid it out: In three days, on August 9, his
squadron, the 336th Rocketeers of the Ninth Air Force of Tactical Air Command
was shipping out to the Arabian Gulf. The orders had come through from TAC
command at Langley Air Force base in Hampton, Virginia. So it was on. The
elation among the pilots had been ecstatic. What was the point of all those
years of training if you never got to fire the goodies?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With three days to go there was a mess of work
to get through, and for him as squadron weapons officer more than most. But he
had begged for just twenty-four hours’ furlough to go and say good-bye to his
folks, and Lieutenant Colonel Steve Turner, chief of weapons, had told him if
there was one tiny detail missing on August 9 when the F-15E Eagles rolled, he—Turner—would
personally kick ass. Then he had grinned and told Walker if he wanted to get
back by sun-up, he had better get moving.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker was hammering up through Snow Hill and
Greenville by nine that morning, heading for the chain of islands east of
Pamlico Sound. He was lucky his parents were not back in Tulsa, or he could
never have made it. Being August, they were taking their annual vacation at the
family beach house near Hatteras, a five-hour drive from the base.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker knew he was a hotshot pilot, and he
reveled in it. To be twenty-nine and do the thing you love best in the world
and do it supremely well is a good feeling. He liked the base, he liked the
guys, and he adored the exhilaration and power of the McDonnell Douglas F-15E
Strike Eagle that he flew. It was, he thought, the best piece of airplane in
the whole U.S. Air Force, and the hell with what the men on the Fighting
Falcons said. Only the Navy’s F-18 Hornet might compare, or so they said, but
he had never flown the Hornet, and the Eagle was just fine by him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At Bethel he turned due east for Columbia and
Whalebone, which was where the highway turned into the island chain; with Kitty
Hawk behind him to his left, he turned south toward Hatteras, where the road
finally ran out and the sea was on all sides. He had had good vacations at
Hatteras as a boy, going out to sea in the early dawn with his grandfather for
bluefish, until the old man got sick and could not go anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now that his dad was retiring from the oil job
in Tulsa maybe he and Mom would spend more time at the beach house and he could
get down there more often. He was young enough that the thought that he might
not come back from the Gulf, if there was a war, did not cross his mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker had graduated from high school in Tulsa
at the age of eighteen with only one burning ambition—he wanted to fly. So far
as he could recall, he had always wanted to fly. He spent four years at
Oklahoma State, majoring in aeronautical engineering, and he graduated in June
1983. He had done his time with the ROTC, and that fall he was inducted into
the Air Force.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He underwent pilot training at Williams AFB,
near Phoenix, flying the T-33 and the T-38, and after eleven months, at wings
parade, he learned he had passed as a distinguished graduate, fourth out of
forty pupils. To his abiding joy, the top five graduates went to fighter
lead-in school at Holloman AFB, near Alamagordo, New Mexico. The rest of the
pupils, he thought with the supreme arrogance of a young man destined to fly
fighters, would be sent to become bomb-droppers or trash-carriers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the replacement training unit at Homestead,
Florida, he finally quit the T-38 and converted to the F-4 Phantom, a big,
powerful brute of a plane, but a real fighter at last.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nine months at Homestead ‘terminated with his
first squadron posting, to Osan in South Korea, flying the Phantoms for a year.
He was good and he knew it, and so apparently did the brass. After Osan, they
sent him to the Fighter Weapons School at McConnell AFB in Wichita, Kansas.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Fighter Weapons runs arguably the toughest
course in the USAF. It marks out the high-fliers, career-wise. The technology
of the new weapons is awe-inspiring. Graduates of McConnell have to understand
every nut and bolt, every silicon chip and microcircuit of the bewildering
array of ordnance that a modern fighter plane can launch at its opponents, in
the air or on the ground. Walker emerged again as a distinguished graduate,
which meant that every fighter squadron in the Air Force would be happy to have
him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The 336th Squadron at Goldsboro got him in the
summer of ’87, flying Phantoms for a year, followed by four months at Luke AFB
in Phoenix, then converting to the Strike Eagle with which the Rocketeers were
being reequipped. He had been flying the Eagle for more than a year when Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Stingray turned just before midday into the
island chain; a few miles to his north stood the monument at Kitty Hawk where
Orville and Wilbur Wright had hauled their string-and-wire contraption into the
air for a few yards to prove that man really could fly in a powered airplane.
If they only knew ...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Through Nag’s Head he followed the crawl of
campers and trailers until they finally petered out and the road emptied past
Cape Hatteras onto the tip of the island. He ran the Stingray onto the driveway
of his parents’ timber-clad frame house just before one. He found them on the
porch that faced out over the calm blue sea.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ray Walker caught sight of his son first and
let out a shout of pleasure. Maybelle came out from the kitchen, where she had
been preparing lunch, and rushed into his embrace. His grandfather was sitting
in his rocking chair, looking at the sea. Don walked over and said:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hi, Grandpa. It’s me, Don.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man looked up and nodded and smiled;
then he looked back at the ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s not so good,” said Ray. “Sometimes he
knows you, sometimes he doesn’t. Well, sit down and tell us the news. Hey,
Maybelle, how’s about a couple of beers for some thirsty guys?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Over the beers, Don told his parents he was off
to the Gulf in five days. Maybelle’s hand flew to her mouth; his father looked
solemn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, I guess that’s what it’s for, the
training and all,” he said at length.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don swigged his beer and wondered not for the
first time why parents always had to worry so much. His grandpa was staring at
him, some kind of recognition in his rheumy eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’s going off to war, Grandpa,” Ray Walker
shouted at him. The old man’s eyes flickered with life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All his career he had been a Marine, joining
the Corps straight out of school many, many years before, in 1941 he had kissed
his wife good-bye and left her with her folks in Tulsa, along with their
newborn baby, Maybelle, to go to the Pacific. He had been with MacArthur on
Corregidor and heard him say, “I shall return,” and he had been twenty yards
away from the general when MacArthur did return.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In between he had fought his way through a
dozen miserable atolls in the Marianas and survived the hell of Iwo Jima. He
carried seventeen scars on his body, all from combat, and was entitled to wear
the ribbons of a Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and seven Purple Hearts on his
chest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had always refused to take a commission,
happy to stay a master sergeant, for he knew where the real power lay. He had
waded ashore at Inchon, Korea, and when they finally sent him to finish his
Corps days as an instructor at Parris Island, his dress uniform carried more decorations
than any other piece of cloth on the base. When they finally retired him after
two deferments, four generals showed up at his last parade, which was more than
normally show up for another general.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man beckoned his grandson toward him. Don
rose from the table and leaned over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Watch out for them Japanese, boy,” the old man
whispered, “or they’ll gitcha.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don put an arm round the old man’s thin,
rheumaticky shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t you worry, Grandpa. They won’t get
anywhere near me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man nodded and seemed satisfied. He was
eighty. It was not, finally, the Japanese or the Koreans who had gotten the
immortal sergeant. It was old Mr. Alzheimer. These days he spent most of his
time in a pleasant dream, with his daughter and son-in-law to look after him
because he had nowhere else to go.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After lunch Don’s parents told him about their
tour of the Arabian Gulf, from which they had returned four days earlier.
Maybelle went and fetched her pictures, which had just arrived back from the
developer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don sat by his mother’s side while she went
through the pile, identifying the palaces and mosques, sea-fronts and markets
of the chain of emirates and sheikhdoms she and Ray had visited.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now you be careful when you get down there,”
she admonished her son. “These are the kind of people you’ll be up against.
Dangerous people—just look at those eyes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker looked at the picture in her hand.
The Bedouin stood between two sand dunes with the desert behind him, one
trailing end of his <i>keffiyeh</i> tucked up and across his face. Only the
dark eyes stared suspiciously out toward the camera.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll be sure and keep a look-out for him,” he
promised her. At that she seemed satisfied.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At five o’clock he decided he should head back
to the base. His parents escorted him to the front of the house where his car
was parked. Maybelle hugged her son and told him yet again to take care, and
Ray embraced him and said they were proud of him. Don got into the car and
reversed to swing into the road. He looked back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the house his grandfather, supported by
two canes, emerged onto the veranda. Slowly he placed the two canes to one side
and straightened up, forcing the rheumatism out of his old back and shoulders
until they were square. Then he raised his hand, palm down, to the peak of his
baseball cap and held it there, an old warrior saluting his grandson who was
leaving for yet another war.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don, from the car, brought up his hand in
reply. Then he touched the accelerator and sped away. He never saw his
grandfather again. The old man died in his sleep in late October.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was already dark by then in London. Terry Martin had
worked late, for although the undergraduates were away for the long summer
vacation, he had lectures to prepare, and because of the specialized vacation
courses the school also ran, he was kept quite busy even through the summer
months. But that evening he was forcing himself to find something to do, to
keep his mind off his worry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He knew where his brother had gone, and in his
mind’s eye he imagined the perils of trying to penetrate Iraqi-occupied Kuwait
under deep cover.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At ten, while Don Walker was beginning his
drive north from Hatteras, Terry left the school, bidding a courteous good
night to the old janitor who locked up after him, and walked down Gower Street
and St. Martin’s Lane toward Trafalgar Square. Perhaps, he thought, the bright
lights would cheer him up. It was a warm and balmy evening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At St. Martin-in-the-Fields, he noticed that
the doors were open and the sound of hymns came from inside. He entered, found
a pew near the rear, and listened to the choir practice. But the choristers’
clear voices only made his depression deeper. He thought back to the childhood
that he and Mike had shared thirty years earlier in Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nigel and Susan Martin had lived in a fine,
roomy old house on two floors in Saadun, that fashionable district in the half
of the city called Risafa. Terry’s first recollection, when he was two, was of
his dark-haired brother being dressed up to start his first day at Miss Saywell’s
kindergarten school. It had meant shirt and short trousers, with shoes and
socks, the uniform of an English boy. Mike “had yelled in protest at being
separated from his usual <i>dish-dash</i>, the white cotton robe that gave
freedom of movement and kept the body cool.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Life had been easy and elegant for the British
community in Baghdad in the fifties. There was membership in the Man-sour Club
and in the Alwiya Club, with its swimming pool, tennis courts, and squash
court, where officers of the Iraq Petroleum Company and the embassy would meet
to play, swim, lounge, or take cool drinks at the bar.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He could remember Fatima, their <i>dada</i> or
nanny, a plump gentle girl from an up-country village whose wages were hoarded
to make her a dowry so that she could marry a well-set-up young man when she
went back to her tribe. He used to play on the lawn with Fatima until they went
to collect Mike from Miss Saywell’s school.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before each boy was three, he was bilingual in
English and Arabic, learning the latter from Fatima or the gardener or the
cook. Mike was especially quick at the language, and as their father was a keen
admirer of Arab culture, the house was often full of his Iraqi friends.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Arabs tend to love small children anyway,
showing far more patience with them than Europeans, and when Mike would dart
about the lawn with his black hair and dark eyes, running free in the white <i>dish-dash</i>
and chattering in Arabic, his father’s Iraqi friends would laugh with pleasure
and shout:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But Nigel, he’s more like one of us!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were outings on the weekends to watch the
Royal Harithiya Hunt, a sort of English foxhunt transported to the Middle East,
which hunted jackals under the mastership of the municipal architect Philip
Hirst, with a “mutton grab” of kuzi and vegetables for all afterward. And there
were wonderful picnics down the river on Pig Island, set in the middle of the
slow-moving Tigris which bisected the city.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After two years Terry had followed Mike to Miss
Saywell’s kindergarten, but because he was so gifted they had gone on together
to the Foundation Prep School, run by Mr. Hartley, at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had been six and his brother eight when they
turned up for their first day at Tasisiya, which contained some English boys
but also Iraqi lads of upper-class parents.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By then, there had already been one coup d’état
in Iraq. The boy king and Nuri as Said had been slaughtered and the
nee-Communist General Kassem had taken absolute power. Though the two young
English boys were unaware of it all, their parents and the English community
were becoming worried. Favoring the Iraq Communist Party, Kassem was carrying
out a vicious pogrom against the nationalist Ba’ath Party members, who in turn
tried to assassinate the general. One of those in the group that failed to
machine-gun the dictator was a young firebrand called Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On his first day at school Terry had found
himself surrounded by a group of Iraqi boys.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s a grub,” said one. Terry began to cry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m not a grub,” he sniffled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, you are,” said the tallest boy. “You’re
fat and white, with funny hair. You look like a grub. Grub, grub, grub.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then they all took up the chant. Mike appeared
from behind him. Of course, they were all talking Arabic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do not call my brother a grub,” he warned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Your brother? He doesn’t look like your
brother. But he does look like a grub.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The use of the clenched fist is not part of
Arab culture. In fact, it is alien to most cultures, except in certain parts of
the Far East. Even south of the Sahara the closed fist is not a traditional
weapon. Black men from Africa and their descendants had to be taught to bunch
the fist and throw a punch; then they became the best in the world at it. The
closed-fist punch is very much a western Mediterranean and particularly
Anglo-Saxon tradition.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin’s right-hand punch landed full on
the jaw of the chief Terry-baiter and knocked him flat. The boy was not so much
hurt as surprised. But no one ever called Terry a grub again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Surprisingly, Mike and the Iraqi boy then
became the best of friends. Throughout their prep school years, they were
inseparable. The tall boy’s name was Hassan Rahmani. The third member of Mike’s
gang was Abdelkarim Badri, who had a younger brother, Osman, the same age as
Terry. So Terry and Osman became friends as well, which was useful because
Badri Senior was often to be found at their parents’ house. He was a doctor,
and the Martins were happy to have him as their family physician. It was he who
helped Mike and Terry Martin through the usual childhood ailments of measles,
mumps, and chicken pox.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim, the older Badri boy, Terry
recalled, was fascinated by poetry, his head always buried in a book of the
English poets, and he won prizes for poetry reading even when he was up against
the English boys. Osman, the younger one, was good at mathematics and said he
wanted to be an engineer or an architect one day and build beautiful things.
Terry sat in his pew on that warm evening in 1990 and wondered what had
happened to them all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While they studied at Tasisiya, things around
them in Iraq were changing. Four years after he came to power by murdering the
King, Kassem himself was toppled and butchered by an Army that had become
worried by his flirtation with Communism. There followed eleven months of rule
shared between the Army and the Ba’ath Party, during which the Ba’athists took
savage revenge on their former persecutors, the Communists.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then the Army ousted the Ba’ath, pushing its
members once again into exile, and ruled alone until 1968.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But in 1966, at the age of thirteen, Mike had
been sent to complete his education at an English public school called
Haileybury. Terry duly followed in 1968. In late June that summer, his parents
took him over to England so they could all spend the long vacation together
there before Terry joined Mike at school. That way they missed by chance the
two coups, on July 14 and 30, that toppled the Army and swept the Ba’ath Party
to power under President Bakr, with a vice-president called Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nigel Martin had suspected something was coming
and had made his plans. He left the IPC and joined a British-based oil company
called Burmah Oil, and after packing up the family’s affairs in Baghdad, he
settled the family outside Hertford, from where he could commute daily to
London and his new job.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nigel Martin became a keen golfer, and on
weekends his sons would often act as caddies when he played with a fellow
executive from Burmah Oil, a certain Mr. Denis Thatcher, whose wife was quite
interested in politics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry loved Haileybury, which was then under
the head-mastership of William Stewart; both boys were in Melvill House, whose
housemaster then was Richard Rhodes-James. Predictably, Terry turned out to be
the scholar and Mike the athlete. Scorning having a go at a place in
university, Mike announced early that he wanted to make a career in the Army.
It was a decision with which Mr. Rhodes-James was happy to agree. If Mike’s
protective attitude toward his shorter and chubbier brother had begun at Mr.
Hartley’s school in Baghdad, it was confirmed at Haileybury, as was the younger
boy’s adoration of his sibling.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin left the darkened church when the
choir practice ended, walked across Trafalgar Square, and caught a bus to Bayswater,
where he and Hilary shared a flat. As he passed up Park Lane, he thought back
to the school years with Mike. And now, by being stupid when he should have
kept his mouth shut, he had caused his brother to be sent into occupied Kuwait.
He felt close to tears with worry and frustration.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He left the bus and scurried down Chepstow
Gardens. Hilary, who had been away for three days on business, should be back.
He hoped so; he needed to be comforted. When he let himself in, he called out
and heard with joy the answering voice from the sitting room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He entered the room and blurted out the stupid
thing he had done. Then he felt himself enfolded in the warm, comforting
embrace of the kind, gentle stockbroker with whom he shared his life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin had spent two days with the Head of Station in
Riyadh, a station that had now been beefed up with the addition of two more men
from Century.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Riyadh station normally works out of the
embassy, and since Saudi Arabia is regarded, as a most friendly country to
British interests, it has never been regarded as a “hard” posting, requiring a
large staff and complex facilities. But the ten-day-old crisis in the Gulf had
changed things.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The newly created Coalition of Western and Arab
nations adamantly opposed to Iraq’s continued occupation of Kuwait already had
two appointed co-commanders-in-chief, General Norman Schwarzkopf of the United
States and Prince Khaled bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz, a forty-four-year-old
professional soldier, trained in the States and at Sandhurst in England, a
nephew of the King, and son of Defense Minister Prince Sultan.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Prince Khaled, in response to the British
request, had been as gracious as usual, and with remarkable speed a large
detached villa had been acquired on the outskirts of the city for the British
embassy to rent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Technicians from London were installing receivers
and transmitters with their inevitable encryption machines for secure usage,
and the place was about to become the headquarters of the British Secret
Service for the duration of the emergency. Somewhere across town, the Americans
were doing much the same for the CIA, which clearly intended to have a very
major presence. The animus that would later develop between the senior brass of
the U.S. armed forces and the civilians of the Agency had not yet begun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the interim, Mike Martin had stayed at the
private house of the Station Head, Julian Gray. Both men agreed there would be
no advantage in Martin being seen by anyone in the embassy. The charming Mrs.
Gray, a career wife, had been his hostess and never dreamt of asking who he was
or what he was doing in Saudi Arabia. Martin spoke no Arabic to the Saudi
staff, just accepted the offered coffee with a smile and a thank you in
English.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the evening of the second day, Gray was
giving Martin his final briefing. They seemed to have covered everything they
could, at least from Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’ll be flying to Dhahran tomorrow morning.
Civilian flight of Saudia. They’ve stopped running direct into Khafji. You’ll
be met. The Firm has set up a dispatcher in Khafji; he’ll meet you and run you
north. Actually, I think he’s ex-regiment. Sparky Low—do you know him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know him,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s got all the things you said you needed.
And he’s found a young Kuwaiti pilot you might like to talk to. He’ll be
getting from us all the latest pictures from the American satellites showing
the border area and the main concentrations of Iraqi troops to avoid, plus
anything else we get. Now, lastly, these pictures have just come in from
London.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He spread a row of large, glossy pictures out
on the dining table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Saddam doesn’t seem to have appointed an Iraqi
Governor-General yet; he’s still trying to put together an administration of
Kuwaiti quislings and getting nowhere. Even the Kuwaiti opposition won’t play
ball. But it seems there’s already quite a Secret Police presence there. This
one here seems to be the local AMAM chief, name of Colonel Sabaawi, quite a
bastard. His boss in Baghdad, who may visit, is the head of the Amn-al-Amm,
Omar Khatib. Here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin stared at the face in the photograph:
surly, sullen, a mix of cruelty and peasant cunning in the eyes and mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“His reputation is pretty bloody. Same as his
sidekick in Kuwait, Sabaawi. Khatib is about forty-five, comes from Tikrit, a
clansman of Saddam himself and a longtime henchman. We don’t know much about
Sabaawi, but he’ll be more in evidence.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gray pulled over another photograph.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Apart from the AMAM, Baghdad has sent in a
team from the Mukhabarat’s Counterintelligence wing, probably to cope with the
foreigners and any attempt at espionage or sabotage directed from outside their
new conquest. The CI boss is this one here—got a reputation as cunning and
nobody’s fool. He may be the one to be careful of.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was August 8. Another C-5 Galaxy was
rumbling overhead to land at the nearby military airport, part of the vast
American logistical machine that was already in gear and pouring its endless
materiel into a nervous, uncomprehending, and extremely traditional Moslem
kingdom.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin looked down and stared at the face
of Hassan Rahmani.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was Steve Laing on the phone again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t want to talk,” said Terry Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think we should, Dr. Martin. Look, you’re
worried about your brother, are you not?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very much.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s no need to be, you know. He’s a very
tough character, well able to look after himself. He wanted to go, no question
of it. We gave him absolute right to turn us down.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I should have kept my mouth shut.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Try and look at it this way, Doctor. If worse
comes to worst, we may have to send a lot of other brothers, husbands, sons,
uncles, loved ones out to the Gulf. If there’s anything any of us can do to
limit their casualties, shouldn’t we try?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right. What do you want?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, another lunch, I think. Easier to talk man
to man. Do you know the Montcalm Hotel? Say, one o’clock?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Despite the brains, he’s quite an emotional
little blighter,” Laing had remarked to Simon Paxman earlier that morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good Lord,” said Paxman, like an entomologist
who has just been told of an amusing new species discovered under a rock.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The spymaster and the academic had a quiet
booth to themselves—Mr. Costa had seen to it. When the smoked salmon cornets
had been served, Laing broached his subject.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The fact of the matter is, we may actually be
facing a war in the Gulf. Not yet, of course; it will take time to build up the
necessary forces. But the Americans have the bit between their teeth. They are
absolutely determined, with the complete support of our good lady in Downing
Street, to get Saddam Hussein and his thugs out of Kuwait.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Supposing he gets out of his own accord,”
suggested Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, fine, no war needed,” replied Laing,
though privately he thought this option might not be so fine after all. There
were rumors in the wind that were deeply disturbing and had in fact given rise
to his lunch with the Arabist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But if not, we shall just have to go in, under
the auspices of the United Nations, and kick him out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“ ‘We’?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, the Americans mainly. We’ll send forces
to join them; land, sea, air. We’ve got ships in the Gulf right now, fighters
and fighter-bomber squadrons heading south. That sort of thing. Mrs. T is
determined we’ll not be seen to be slacking. At the moment it’s just Desert
Shield, stopping the bastard from getting any thoughts of moving south and
invading Saudi Arabia. But it may come to more than that. You’ve heard of WMD,
of course?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Weapons of mass destruction. Of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the problem. NBC. Nuclear,
bacteriological, and chemical. Privately, our people at Century have been
trying to warn the political masters for a couple of years about this sort of
thing. Last year the Chief presented a paper, ‘Intelligence in the Nineties.’
Warned that the great threat now, since the end of the cold war, is and will be
proliferation. Jumped-up dictators of highly unstable aspect getting hold of
seriously high-tech weaponry and then possibly using it. ‘Top marks,’ they all
said, ‘jolly good’—then did bugger-all about it. Now, of course, they’re all
worried shitless.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s got a lot of it, you know: Saddam
Hussein,” remarked Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the point, my dear fellow. We estimate
Saddam has spent fifty billion dollars over the past decade on weapons
procurement. That’s why he’s bankrupt—owes fifteen billion to the Kuwaitis,
another fifteen to the Saudis, and that’s just for loans made to him during the
Iran-Iraq war. He invaded because they refused to write it all off and bung him
another thirty billion to get his economy out of trouble.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now, the meat of the problem is that one-third
of that fifty billion—an incredible seventeen billion greenbacks—has been spent
acquiring WMD or the means to make them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the West has woken up at last?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“With a vengeance. There’s a hell of an
operation going on. Langley’s been told to race around the world to trace every
government that’s ever sold anything to Iraq and check out the export permits.
We’re doing the same.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Shouldn’t take that long if they all
cooperate, and they probably will,” said Martin, as his wing of skate arrived.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s not that easy,” said Laing. “Although it’s
early yet, it’s already clear Saddam’s son-in-law Kamil has set up a damnably
clever procurement machine. Hundreds of small dummy companies all over Europe
and North, Central, and South America. Buying bits and bobs that didn’t seem to
mean much. Forging export applications, fudging the details of the product,
lying about its end-use, diverting purchases through countries that were on the
export certificate as the final destination. But put all the innocent-seeming
bits and bobs together, and you can get something really nasty.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We know he’s got gas,” said Martin. “He’s used
it on the Kurds and the Iranians at Fao. Phosgene, mustard gas. But I’ve heard
there are nerve agents as well. No odor, no visible sign. Lethal and very
short-lived.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“My dear chap, I knew it. You’re a mine of
information.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing knew all about the gas, but he knew more
about flattery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then there’s anthrax,” said Martin. “He’s been
experimenting with that, and maybe pneumonic plague. But you know, you can’t
just run up these things with a pair of kitchen gloves. You need some very
specialized chemical equipment. It should show up on the export licenses.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing nodded and sighed with frustration.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Should, yes. But the investigators are already
running into two problems. A wall of obfuscation from some companies, mainly in
Germany, and the question of dual-use. Someone ships out a cargo of pesticide—what
could be more innocent in a country trying to boost its agricultural
production, or so it says. Another company in another country ships a different
chemical—same apparent reason, pesticide. Then some smart chemist puts them
together and bingo—poison gas. Both the suppliers whine, ‘We didn’t know.’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The key will lie in the chemical blending
equipment,” said Martin. “This is high-tech chemistry. You can’t mix these
things up in a bathtub. Find the people who supplied the turnkey factories and
the men who assembled them. They may huff and puff, but they’ll know exactly
what they were doing when they did it. And what it was for.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Turnkey factories?” asked Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Whole plants, built from scratch by foreign
contracted companies. The new owner just turns the key and walks in. But none
of this explains our lunch. You must have access to chemists and physicists. I’ve
only heard of these things because of a personal interest. Why me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing stirred his coffee thoughtfully. He had
to play this one carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, we have chemists and physicists.
Scientists of all kinds. And no doubt they’ll come up with some answers. Then
we’ll translate the answers into plain English. The Americans will do the same.
We’re working in total cooperation with Washington on this, and we’ll compare
our analyses. We’ll get some answers, but we won’t get them all. We believe you
have something different to offer. Hence this lunch. Do you know that most of
our top brass still take the view that the Arabs couldn’t assemble a kid’s
bicycle, let alone invent one?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had touched on a nerve, and he knew it. The
psycho-portrait he had ordered on Dr. Terry Martin was about to prove its
worth. Martin flushed deep pink, then controlled himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I really do get pissed off,” he said, “when my
own fellow countrymen insist the Arab peoples are just a bunch of camel-herders
who choose to wear tea towels on their heads. Yes, I have actually heard it
expressed that way. The fact is, they were building extremely complex palaces,
mosques, ports, highways, and irrigation systems when our ancestors were still
running around in bearskins. They had rulers and lawgivers of amazing wisdom
when we were in the Dark Ages.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin leaned forward and jabbed at the man
from Century with his coffee spoon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I tell you, the Iraqis have among them some
brilliant scientists, and as builders they are beyond compare. Their
construction engineers are better than anything for a thousand-mile radius around
Baghdad, and I include Israel. Many may have been Soviet or Western trained,
but they have absorbed our knowledge like sponges and then made an enormous
input themselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He paused, and Laing pounced.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dr. Martin, I couldn’t agree with you more. I’ve
only been with Century’s Mid-East Division for a year, but I’ve come to the
same view as you—that the Iraqis are a very talented people. But they happen to
be ruled by a man who has already committed genocide. Is all this money and all
this talent really going to be put to the purpose of killing tens, maybe
hundreds of thousands of people? Is Saddam going to bring glory to the people
of Iraq, or is he going to bring them slaughter?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re right. He’s an aberration. He wasn’t
once, long ago, but he’s become one. He’s perverted the nationalism of the old
Ba’ath Party into National Socialism, drawing his inspiration from Adolf
Hitler. What do you want of me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing thought for a while. He was close, too
close to lose his man now.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“George Bush and Mrs. T have agreed that our
two countries put together a body to investigate and analyze the whole area of
Saddam’s WMD. The investigators will bring in the facts as they discover them.
The scientists will tell us what they mean. What has he got? How developed? How
much of it? What do we need to protect ourselves against, if it comes to war—gas
masks? Space suits? Antidote syringes? We don’t know yet just what he’s got or
just what we’ll need—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But I know nothing of these things,” Martin
interrupted him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, but you know something we don’t. The Arab
mind, Saddam’s mind. Will he use what he’s got? Will he tough it out in Kuwait,
or will he quit? What inducements will make him quit? Will he go to the end of
the line? Our people just don’t understand this Arab concept of martyrdom.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin laughed. “President Bush,” he said, “and
all the people around him will act according to their upbringing. Which is
based on the Judeo-Christian moral philosophy supported by the Greco-Roman
concept of logic. And Saddam will react on the basis of his own vision of
himself.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“As an Arab and a Moslem?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Uh-unh. Islam has nothing to do with it.
Saddam doesn’t care a fig for the <i>hadith</i>, the codified teachings of the
Prophet. He prays on camera when it suits him. No, you have to go back to
Nineveh and Assyria. He doesn’t mind how many have to die, so long as he thinks
he can win.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He can’t win, not against America. Nobody can.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Wrong. You use the word <i>win</i> as a
Britisher or an American would use it. The way Bush and Scowcroft and the rest
are using it even now. He will see it differently. If he quits Kuwait because
he is paid to by King Fahd, which might have happened if the Jeddah conference
had taken place, he can win with honor. To be paid to quit is acceptable. He
wins. But America will not allow that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No way.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But if he quits under threat, he loses. All
Arabia will see that. He will lose, and probably die. So he will not quit.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And if the American war machine is launched
against him? He’ll be smashed to bits,” said Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It doesn’t matter. He has his bunker. His
people will die. Not important. But if he can hurt America, he will win. If he
can hurt America badly, really badly, he will be covered in glory. Dead or
alive. He will win.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody hell, it’s complicated,” sighed Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not really. There’s a quantum leap in moral
philosophy when you cross the Jordan. Let me ask again: What do you want of me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The committee is forming, to try and advise
our masters on the question of these weapons of mass destruction. The guns,
tanks, airplanes—the Ministries of Defence will deal with those. They’re not
the problem. Just ironmongery—we can destroy it from the air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Actually, there are two committees, one in
Washington and one here in London. British observers on theirs, American
observers on ours. There’ll be people from the Foreign Office, Aldermaston,
Porton Down. Century has two places. I’m sending a colleague, head of the Iraq
desk, Simon Paxman. I’d like you to sit with him, see if there’s an aspect of
interpretation that we might miss because it’s a peculiarly Arab aspect. That’s
your forte—that’s what you can contribute.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, for what I can contribute, which
may be nothing. What’s it called, the committee? When does it meet?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah, yes, Simon will call you with the when and
where. Actually, it’s got an appropriate name. Medusa.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A soft and warm Carolina dusk was moving toward Seymour
Johnson Air Force base that late afternoon of August 10, beckoning the sort of
evening for a pitcher of rum punch in the ice bucket and a corn-fed steak on
the grill.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The men of the 334th Tactical Fighter Squadron
who were still not operational on the F-15E, and those of the 335th TFS, the
Chiefs, who would fly out to the Gulf in December, stood by and watched. With
the 336th Squadron, they made up the Fourth Tactical Fighter Wing of the Ninth
Air Force. It was the 336th who were on the move.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two days of frenzied activity were at last
coming to an end; two days of preparing the airplanes, planning the route,
deciding on the gear, and stashing the secret manuals and the squadron computer—with
all its battle tactics locked in its data bank—into containers to be brought by
the transports. Moving a squadron of warplanes is not like moving a house,
which can be bad enough. It is like moving a small city.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Out on the tarmac the twenty-four F-15E Strike
Eagles crouched in silence, fearsome beasts waiting for the spidery little
creatures of the same species who had designed and built them to climb aboard
and unleash with insignificant fingertips their awful power.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were rigged for the long flight across the
world to the Arabian Peninsula in one single journey. The fuel weight alone—thirteen
and a half tons—was the payload of five Second World War bombers. And the Eagle
is a fighter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The crews’ personal gear was packed in travel
pods, former napalm pods now put to more humane use, canisters below the wings
containing shirts, socks, shorts, soap, shaving gear, uniforms, mascots, and
girlie magazines. For all they knew, it might be a long way to the nearest
singles bar.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The great KC-10 tankers that would mother-hen
the fighters all the way across the Atlantic, and on to the Saudi peninsula,
all four of them feeding six Eagles each, were already aloft, waiting out over
the ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later, an air caravan of Starlifters and
Galaxies would bring the rest, the small army of riggers and fitters,
electronics men and support staff, the ordnance and the spares, the power jacks
and workshops, the machine tools and the benches. They could count on finding
nothing at the other end; everything to keep two dozen of the world’s most
sophisticated fighter-bombers up and combat-ready would have to be transported
on that same odyssey halfway around the world.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Each Strike Eagle that evening represented $44
million worth of black boxes, aluminum, carbon-fiber composites, computers, and
hydraulics, along with some rather inspired design work. Although that design
had originated thirty years earlier, the Eagle was a new fighter plane, so long
does research and development take.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Heading up the civic delegation from the town
of Goldsboro was the mayor, Hal K. Plonk. This very fine public servant
rejoices in the nickname awarded him by his grateful twenty thousand fellow
citizens—“Kerplunk,” a sobriquet he earned for his ability to amuse sober
delegations from politically correct Washington with his southern drawl and
fund of jokes. Some visitors from the capital have been known, after an hour of
the mayor’s rib-ticklers, to leave for Washington in search of trauma therapy.
Naturally, Mayor Plonk is returned to office after each term with an increased
majority.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Standing beside the wing commander, Hal
Hornburg, the civic delegation gazed with pride as the Eagles, towed by their
tractors, emerged from the hangars and the aircrew climbed aboard, the pilot in
the forward seat of the dual cockpit and his weapons systems officer, or wizzo,
in the rear. Around each airplane a cluster of ground crew worked on the
prestartup checks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Did I ever tell you,” asked the mayor
pleasantly to the very senior Air Force officer beside him, “the story of the
general and the hooker?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At this point, Don Walker mercifully started
his engines and the howl of two Pratt and Whitney F100-PW-220 turbo-jets
drowned out the details of that lady’s unfortunate experiences at the hands of
the general. The F100 can convert fossil fuel to a lot of noise and heat and
24,000 pounds of thrust and was about to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One by one the twenty-four Eagles of the 336th
started up and began to roll the mile to the end of the runway. Small red flags
fluttered under the wings, showing where pins secured the underwing Sparrow and
Sidewinder missiles to their pylons. These pins would only come out just before
takeoff. Their journey to Arabia might be a peaceful one, but to send an Eagle
aloft with no means of self-defense at all would be unthinkable.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Along the taxiway to takeoff point were groups
of armed guards and Air Force police. Some waved, some saluted. Just before the
runway, the Eagles stopped again and were subjected to the final attention of a
swarm of ordnance men and ground crew. They chocked the wheels, then checked
over each jet in turn, looking for leaks, loose fittings, or panels—anything
that might have gone wrong during the taxiing. Finally, the pins on the
missiles were pulled out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Patiently, the Eagles waited, sixty-three feet
long, eighteen high and forty across, weighing 40,000 pounds bone dry and
81,000 at maximum takeoff weight, which they were close to now. It would be a
long takeoff run.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, they rolled to the runway, turned into
the light breeze, and accelerated down the tarmac. Afterburners kicked in as
the pilots rammed the throttles through the “gate,” and thirty-foot flames
leaped from the tail pipes. Beside the runway the crew chiefs, heads protected
by helmets from the fearsome noise, saluted their babies away on foreign
assignment. They would not see them again until Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A mile down the runway, the wheels left the
tarmac and the Eagles were airborne. Wheels up, flaps up, throttles pulled back
out of afterburn and into military power setting. The twenty-four Eagles turned
their noses to the sky, established a climb rate of five thousand feet per
minute, and disappeared into the dusk.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They leveled at 25,000 feet, and an hour later
saw the position lights and navigation strobe of the first KC-10 tanker. Time
to top up. The two F100 engines have a fearsome thirst. With afterburner
running, they each go through 40,000 pounds of fuel per hour, which is why the
afterburn or “reheat” is only used for takeoff, combat, or emergency let’s-get-out-of-here
maneuvers. Even at normal power settings, the engines need a top up every one
and a half hours. To get to Saudi Arabia they would need their KC-10s, their
gas stations in the sky, desperately.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The squadron was by now in wide formation, each
wingman formatting on his element leader in line abreast, about a mile between
wingtips. Don Walker, with his wizzo behind him, glanced out to see his wingman
holding position where he should be. Flying east, they were now in darkness
over the Atlantic, but the radar showed the position of every aircraft, and
their navigational lights picked them out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the tail of the KC-10 above and ahead of
him, the boom operator opened the panel that protected his window on the world
and gazed out at the sea of lights behind him. The fuel boom extended, waiting
for the first customer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Each group of six Eagles had already identified
its designated tanker, and Walker moved in for his turn. A touch on the
throttle, and the Eagle swam up under the tanker, in range of the boom. In the
tanker the operator “flew” his boom onto the nozzle protruding from the forward
edge of the fighter’s left wing. When he had “lock on,” the fuel began to flow,
two thousand pounds per minute. The Eagle drank and drank.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When it was full, Walker pulled away and his
wingman slid up to suckle. Across the sky, three other tankers were doing the
same for each of their six charges.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They flew through the night, which was short
because they were flying toward the sun at about five hundred miles per hour
over the ground. After six hours the sun rose again, and they crossed the coast
of Spain, flying north of the African coast to avoid Libya. Approaching Egypt,
which was a member of the Coalition forces, the 336th turned southeast, drifted
over the Red Sea, and caught its first sight of that huge ochre-brown slab of
sand and gravel called the Arabian Desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After fifteen hours airborne, tired and stiff,
the forty-eight young Americans landed at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia. Within hours
they were diverted to their ultimate destination, the air base of Thumrait in
the Sultanate of Oman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For four months, until mid-December, they would
live here in conditions on which they would later look back with nostalgia,
seven hundred miles from the Iraqi border and the danger zone. They would fly
training missions over the Omani interior when their support gear arrived, swim
in the blue waters of the Indian Ocean, and wait for whatever the good Lord and
Norman Schwarzkopf had in store for them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In December they would relocate into Saudi
Arabia, and one of them, though he would never know it, would alter the course
of the war.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942756">Chapter 5</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Dhahran Airport was choked. It seemed to Mike Martin
as he arrived from Riyadh that most of the eastern seaboard wanted to be on the
move. Situated at the heart of the great chain of oil fields that brought Saudi
Arabia her fabulous wealth, Dhahran had long been accustomed to Americans and
Europeans—unlike Taif, Riyadh, Yenbo, and the other cities of the kingdom. Even
the bustling port of Jeddah was not accustomed to so many Anglo-Saxon faces on
the street, but by the second week of August, Dhahran was reeling from the
invasion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Some were trying to get out; many had driven
across the causeway into Bahrain to fly out from there. Others were at the
Dhahran airport, wives and families of oil men mainly, heading for Riyadh and a
connecting flight home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Others were coming in, a torrent of Americans
with their weaponry and stores. Martin’s own civilian flight just squeezed in
between two lumbering C-5 Galaxies, two of an almost nose-to-tail air convoy
from Britain, Germany, and the United States that was engaged in the steady
buildup that would transform northeastern Saudi Arabia into one great armed
camp.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This was not Desert Storm; the campaign to
liberate Kuwait was still five months away. This was Desert Shield, designed to
deter the Iraqi Army, now increased to fourteen divisions deployed along the
border and throughout Kuwait, from rolling south.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To a watcher at the Dhahran airport, it might
seem impressive, but a more intensive study would reveal that the protective
skin was paper-thin. The American armor and artillery had not yet arrived—the
earliest sea departures were just clearing the U.S. coastline—and the stores
carried by the Galaxies, Starlifters, and Hercules were a fraction of the sort
of cargo a ship could carry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Eagles based at Dhahran and the Hornets of
the Marines on Bahrain, plus the British Tornados that had just arrived at
Dhahran and hardly cooled down from their journey from Germany, had enough
ordnance between them to mount half a dozen missions before running out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It takes more than that to stop a determined
onslaught of massed armor. Despite the impressive show of military hardware at
a few airfields, northeastern Saudi Arabia still lay naked under the sun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin shouldered his way out of the milling
throng in the arrivals hall, his tote bag over one shoulder, and caught sight
of a familiar face among the crowd at the barrier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On his first selection course for the SAS, when
they had told him they were not going to try and train him but instead try and
kill him, they had almost succeeded. One day he had marched thirty miles over
the Brecons, some of the crudest terrain in Britain, in freezing rain with one
hundred pounds of gear in his Bergen rucksack. Like the others, he was beyond
exhaustion, locked into a private world where all existence was a miasma of
pain and only the will survived.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then he had seen the truck, that beautiful
waiting truck. The end of the march and, in terms of human endurance, the end
of the line. A hundred yards, eighty, fifty; an end to the all-consuming agony
of his body crept nearer and nearer as his numbed legs drove him and the Bergen
those last few yards.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There had been a man sitting in the back of the
truck, watching the rain-streaked, pain-wracked face staggering toward him.
When the tail-board was ten inches from Martin’s outstretched fingers, the man
rapped on the rear of the cab and the truck rolled away. It did not roll an
extra hundred yards; it rolled another ten miles. Sparky Low had been the man
in the truck.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hi, Mike. Good to see you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That sort of thing takes an awful lot of
forgiving.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hi, Sparky. How are things.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody hairy, since you ask.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sparky hauled his nondescript four-wheel-drive
jeep out of the parking lot, and in thirty minutes they were clear of Dhahran
and heading north. It was two hundred miles up to Khafji, a three-hour run, but
after the port of Jubail slipped by to their right, they at least had some
privacy. The road was empty. No one had any appetite for a visit to Khafji, a
small oil community on the border of Kuwait, now reduced to a ghost town.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Refugees still coming over?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Some,” nodded Sparky. “Down to a trickle,
though. The main rush has come and gone. Those coming down the main road are
mainly women and kids with passes—the Iraqis let them through to get rid of
them. Smart enough. If I were running Kuwait, I’d want to get rid of the
expatriates too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Some Indians get through—the Iraqis seem to
ignore them. Not so smart. The Indians have good information, and I’ve
persuaded a couple to turn around and go back with messages for our people.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Have you got the stuff I asked for?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yep. Gray must have pulled some strings. It
arrived in a truck with Saudi markings yesterday. I put it in the spare
bedroom. We’ll have dinner tonight with this young Kuwaiti Air Force pilot I
told you about. He claims he has contacts inside, reliable people who might be
useful.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin grunted. “He doesn’t see my face. Might
get shot down.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sparky thought it over. “Right.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sparky Low’s commandeered villa was not half
bad, thought Martin. It belonged to an American oil executive from Aramco,
which had pulled its man out of there and back to Dhahran.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin knew better than to ask just what Sparky
Low was doing in that neck of the woods. It was obvious that he, too, had been “borrowed”
by Century House, and his task seemed to be intercepting the refugees filtering
south and, if they would talk, debriefing them on what they had seen and heard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khafji was virtually deserted, apart from the
Saudi National Guard, who were dug in defensive positions in and around the
town. But there were still a few disconsolate Saudis wandering around, and from
one stallholder in the market, who could not believe that he actually had a
customer, Martin bought the clothes he needed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Electric power was still running in Khafji in
mid-August, which meant the air conditioning functioned, as did the water pump
from the well and the water heater. There was a bath available, but he knew
better than to take one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had not washed, shaved, or brushed his teeth
for three days. If Mrs. Gray, his hostess back in Riyadh, had noticed the
increasing odor, which she certainly had, she was too well bred to mention it.
For dental hygiene Martin just picked his teeth with a splint of wood after a
meal. Sparky Low did not mention it, either, but then, he knew the reason.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Kuwaiti officer turned out to be a handsome
young man of twenty-six who was consumed with rage at what had been done to his
country and was clearly a supporter of the ousted Al Sabah royal dynasty, which
was now lodged in a luxury hotel in Taif as guests of King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was also bewildered to find that though his
host was what he expected—a British officer in civilian casual dress—the third
person at the meal appeared to be a fellow Arab but was dressed in a soiled
off-white <i>thob</i> with a speckled <i>keffiyeh</i> on his head, one trailing
corner tucked across the lower half of his face. Low introduced them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are really British?” asked the young man
in surprise. It was explained to him why Martin was dressed the way he was and
why he kept his face covered. Captain Khaled Al-Khalifa nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“My apologies, Major. Of course I understand.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The captain’s story was clear and
straightforward. He had been called at his home on the evening of August 1 and
told to report to Ahmadi air base, where he was stationed. Through the night,
he and his fellow officers had listened to radio reports of the invasion of
their country from the north. By dawn, his squadron of Skyhawk fighters had
been fueled, armed, and ready for takeoff. The American Skyhawk, though by no
means a modern fighter, could still prove quite useful in a ground attack. It
would never be any match for the Iraqi MiG 23, 25, or 29 or the French-built
Mirage, but fortunately, on his one combat mission to date, he had never met
any.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had found his targets in the northern
suburbs of Kuwait City just after dawn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I got one of their tanks with my rockets,” he
explained excitedly. “I know, because I saw it brew. Then I’d only the cannon
left, so I went for the trucks behind. Got the first one—it swerved into a
ditch and rolled over. Then I was out of ammo, so I flew back. But over Ahmadi,
the control tower told us to head south for the border and save the planes. I
had just enough fuel to make Dhahran.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We got over sixty of our aircraft out, you
know. Skyhawks, Mirages, and the British Hawk trainers. Plus Gazelles, Puma and
Super-Puma helicopters. Now I’ll fight from here and go back when we are
liberated. When do you think the attack will start?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sparky Low smiled cautiously. The boy was so
blissfully certain.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not yet, I’m afraid. You must be patient.
There is preparatory work to be done. Tell us about your father.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pilot’s father, it seemed, was an extremely
wealthy merchant, a friend of the royal family and a power in the land.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Will he favor the invasion forces?” asked Low.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young Al-Khalifa was incensed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Never, never! He will do anything he can to
assist the liberation!” He turned to the dark eyes above the checkered cloth. “Will
you see my father? You can rely on him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Possibly,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Will you give him a message from me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He wrote for several minutes on a sheet of
paper and gave it to Martin. When he had driven back to Dhahran, Martin burned
the sheet in an ashtray. He could carry nothing incriminating into Kuwait City.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the following morning, he and Low packed the
gear he had asked for into the rear of the jeep, and they drove south again as
far as Manifah, then turned west along the Tapline Road, which shadows the
Iraqi border all the way across Saudi Arabia. It was called Tapline because TAP
stands for Trans Arabian Pipeline, and the road serviced the pipeline carrying
so much Saudi crude to the west.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later, the Tapline Road would become the main
transport artery for the biggest military land armada ever seen, as 400,000
American, 70,000 British, 10,000 French, and 200,000 Saudi and other Arab
soldiers massed for the invasion of Iraq and Kuwait from the south. But that
day it was empty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A few miles along it, the jeep turned north
again, back to the Saudi-Kuwaiti border but at a different place, well inland.
Near the fly-blown desert village of Hamatiyyat on the Saudi side, the border
is at its nearest point to Kuwait City itself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Moreover, American photoreconnaissance pictures
obtained by Gray in Riyadh showed that the mass of Iraqi forces were grouped
just above the border but near the coast. The farther inland one went, the
thinner the scattering of Iraqi outposts. They were concentrating their forces
between the Nuwaisib crossing point on the coast and the Al-Wafra border post
forty miles inland.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The village of Hamatiyyat was a hundred miles into
the desert, tucked up into a kink in the line of the border that shortens the
distance to Kuwait City.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The camels that Martin had asked for were
waiting for them at a small farm outside the village, a rangy female in her
prime, and her offspring, a cream-colored calf with a velvet muzzle and gentle
eyes, still at the suck. She would grow up to become as foul-tempered as the
rest of her genus, but not yet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why the calf?” asked Low as they sat in the
jeep and watched the animals in the corral.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Cover story. If anyone asks, I’m taking her to
the camel farms outside Sulaibiya for sale. The prices are better there.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He slid out of the jeep and shuffled on
sandaled feet to rouse the camel-drover, who dozed in the shade of his shack.
For thirty minutes the two men squatted in the dust and haggled the price of
the two beasts. It never occurred to the drover, glancing at the dark face, the
stained teeth, and the stubble, squatting in the dust in his dirty shift and
his odor, that he was not talking to a trader of the Bedouin with money to
spend on two good camels.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the deal was settled, Martin paid up from
a roll of Saudi riyals that he had taken from Low and held under one armpit for
a while until they were soiled. Then he led the two camels a mile away and stopped
when they were shielded from prying eyes by the sand dunes. Low caught up in
the jeep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had sat a few hundred yards from the drover’s
corral and watched. Though he knew the Arabian Peninsula well, he had never
worked with Martin, and he was impressed. The man did not just pretend to be an
Arab; when he had slipped from the jeep, he had simply become a Bedou in every
line and gesture.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though Low did not know it, the previous day in
Kuwait two British engineers, seeking to escape, had left their apartment
dressed in the white neck-to-floor Kuwaiti <i>thob</i> with the <i>ghutra</i>
headdress on their heads. They got halfway to their car fifty feet away when a
child called up from the gutter: “You may dress like an Arab, but you still
walk like English.” The engineers went back to their flat and stayed there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sweating in the sun but out of sight of any who
might be surprised at such labor being carried out in the heat of the day, the
two SAS men transferred the gear into the baggage panniers that hung on either
side of the she-camel. She was hunkered down on all fours but still protested
at the extra weight, spitting and snarling at the men who worked on her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two hundred pounds of Semtex-H explosive
went into one, each five-pound block wrapped in cloth, with some Hessian sacks
of coffee beans on top in case any curious Iraqi soldier insisted on looking.
The other pannier took the submachine guns, ammunition, detonators,
time-pencils, and grenades, along with Martin’s small but powerful transceiver
with its fold-away satellite dish and spare cadmium-nickel batteries. These too
were topped with coffee bags.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they were finished, Low asked:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Anything more I can do?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, that’s it, thanks. I’ll stay here till
sundown. No need for you to wait.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Low held out his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sorry about the Brecons.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin shook it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No sweat. I survived.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Low laughed, a short bark.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yeah, that’s what we do. We fucking survive.
Stay lucky, Mike.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He drove away. The camel rolled an eye,
belched, regurgitated some cud, and began to chew. The calf tried to get at her
teats, failed, and lay down by her side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin propped himself against the camel
saddle, drew his <i>keffiyeh</i> around his face, and thought about the days to
come. The desert would not be a problem; the bustle of occupied Kuwait City might
be. How tight were the controls, how tough the roadblocks, how astute the
soldiers who manned them? Century had offered to try and get him forged papers,
but he had turned them down. The Iraqis might change the ID cards.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was confident that the cover he had chosen
was one of the best in the Arab world. The Bedouin come and go as they please.
They offer no resistance to invading armies, for they have seen too many—Saracen
and Turk, Crusader and Knight Templar, German and French, British and Egyptian,
Israeli and Iraqi. They have survived them all because they stay out of all
matters political and military.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Many regimes have tried to tame them, all
without success. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, decreeing that all his citizens
should have houses, built a handsome village called Escan, equipped with all
modern facilities—a swimming pool, toilets, baths, running water. Some Bedouin
were rounded up and moved in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They drank the pool (it looked like an oasis),
crapped on the patio, played with the water faucets, and then moved out,
explaining politely to their monarch that they preferred to sleep under the
stars. Escan was cleaned up and used by the Americans during the Gulf crisis.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin knew that his real problem was his
height. He was an inch under six feet, but most Bedouin are far shorter than
that. Centuries of sickness and malnourishment have left most of them
disease-ridden and stunted. Water in the desert is only for drinking, by man,
goat, or camel; hence, Martin’s avoiding the bath. The glamour of desert
living, he knew, is strictly for Westerners.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had no identification papers, but that was
not a problem. Several governments have tried to issue the Bedouin with ID
papers. The tribesmen are usually delighted because they make such good toilet
paper, better than a handful of gravel. For a policeman or soldier to insist on
seeing a Bedou’s ID papers is a waste of time, and both parties know it. From
the authorities’ point of view, the main thing is that the Bedouin cause no
trouble. They would never dream of getting involved in any Kuwaiti resistance
movement. Martin knew that; he hoped the Iraqis did, too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He dozed until sundown, then mounted the camel.
At his “hut hut hut,” she rose to her feet. Her baby suckled for a while,
tethered behind her, and they set off at that ambling, rolling pace that seems
to be very slow but covers an amazing amount of ground. The she-camel had been
well fed and watered at the corral and would not tire for days.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was well to the northwest of the Ruqaifah
police station, where a track road passes from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait, when
he crossed the border shortly before eight. The night was black, save for a low
gleam from the stars. The glow of Kuwait’s Manageesh oil field lay to his right
and would probably have an Iraqi patrol in it, but the desert ahead of him was
empty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the map it was thirty-five miles to the
camel farms just south of Sulaibiya, the outlying district of Kuwait City where
he intended to leave his beasts until he needed them again. But before that, he
would bury the gear in the desert and mark the spot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Unless he was stopped and delayed, he would do
this in darkness before sunrise, which was nine hours away. The tenth hour
would bring him to the camel farms.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the Manageesh oil field dropped behind him,
he steered by his hand compass in a straight line for his destination. The
Iraqis, as he had surmised, might patrol the roads, even the tracks, but never
the empty desert. No refugee would try to escape that way, nor enemy to enter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the camel farms, after sunrise, he knew he
could scramble onboard a truck heading into the heart of town, twenty miles
farther on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Far above him, silent in the night sky, a KH-11
satellite of the National Reconnaissance Office slid across the sky. Years
earlier, previous generations of American spy satellites had had to take their
pictures and at intervals spit out the capsules in reentry vehicles, to be
laboriously recovered and the film processed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The KH-11s, sixty-four feet long and weighing
thirty thousand pounds each, are smarter. As they take their images of the
ground below them, they automatically encrypt the pictures into a series of
electronic pulses that are beamed <i>upward</i> to another satellite.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The receiver satellite above is one of a
network positioned in geosynchronous orbit, meaning they drift through space at
a speed and on a course that keeps them always above the same spot on the
earth. In effect, they hover. Having received the images from the KH-11, the
hovering satellite either beams them straight down to the United States or, if
the curve of the earth gets in the way, bounces them across space to another
hovering “bird” that sends the pictures down to its American masters. Thus the
NRO can collect its photographic information in real time, just seconds after
the pictures are taken.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bonus in war is huge. The KH-11 can see,
for example, an enemy convoy on the move well in advance, in time to call up an
air strike to blast the trucks into oblivion. The unfortunate soldiers inside
them would never know how the fighter-bombers found them. For the KH-11s can
work through night and day, in cloud or fog.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The phrase has been used about them: <i>all-seeing</i>.
Alas, it is a self-delusion. The KH-11 that night swept out of Saudi Arabia and
over Kuwait. But it did not see the lone Bedou tribesman entering forbidden
territory, nor would it have cared if it had. It moved over Kuwait and into
Iraq. It saw many buildings, great sprawls of industrial minicities around
Al-Hillah and Tarmiya, Al-Atheer and Tuwaitha, but it did not see what was in
those buildings. It did not see the vats of poison gas in preparation, nor the
uranium hexafluoride destined for the gas-diffusion centrifuges of the isotope
separation plant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It moved north, picking out the airfields, the
highways, and the bridges. It even saw the automobile junkyard at Al Qubai, but
took no notice. It saw the industrial centers of Al Qaim, Jazira, and
Al-Shirqat west and north of Baghdad, but not the devices of mass death that
were being prepared inside them. It passed over the Jebel al Hamreen, but it
did not see the Fortress that had been built by the engineer Osman Badri. It
saw only a mountain among other mountains, hill villages among other hill
villages. Then it passed on over Kurdistan and into Turkey.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin plodded on through the night toward
Kuwait City, invisible in robes he had not worn for almost two weeks. He smiled
on recalling the moment when, returning to his Land-Rover from a hike in the
desert outside Abu Dhabi, he had been surprised to be intercepted by a plump
American lady pointing a camera and shouting “click click” at him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It had been agreed that the British Medusa Committee
should meet for its preliminary conference in a room beneath the Cabinet Office
in Whitehall. The main reason was that the building was secure, being regularly
swept against listening devices, although it did seem that with Russians being
so terribly <i>nice</i> these days, they might have stopped at last attempting
such tiresome practices.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The room to which the eight guests were led was
two floors below ground level. Terry Martin had heard of the warren of
shockproof, bugproof chambers where the most delicate matters of state could be
discussed in complete discretion below the innocent-looking building opposite
the Cenotaph.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sir Paul Spruce took the chair, an urbane and
experienced bureaucrat with the rank of Assistant Permanent Secretary to the
Cabinet. He introduced himself and then everyone to everyone. The American
embassy and thus the United States was represented by the Assistant Defense Attaché
and Harry Sinclair, an astute and experienced officer from Langley who had
headed the CIA’s London station for the past three years. Sinclair was a tall,
angular man who favored tweed jackets, frequented the opera, and got along
extremely well with his British counterparts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The CIA man nodded and winked at Simon Paxman,
whom he had met once at a meeting of the Joint Intelligence Committee, on which
the CIA has a permanent seat in London.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sinclair’s job would be to note anything of
interest that the British scientists might come up with and convey that
information back to Washington, where the considerably larger American end of
the Medusa Committee was also in session. All the findings would then be
collated and compared in the continuing search to analyze Iraq’s potential to
cause appalling casualties.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were two scientists from Aldermaston, the
Weapons Research Establishment in Berkshire—they like to drop the word <i>atomic</i>
in front of WRE, but that is what Aldermaston is all about. Their job would be
to try and elucidate from information out of the United States, Europe, and
anywhere else it could be gleaned, plus air photographs of possible Iraqi
nuclear research facilities, just how far, if at all, Iraq had proceeded in its
quest to crack the technology of making an atomic bomb of her own.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were two other scientists, from Porton
Down. One was a chemist, the other a biologist specializing in bacteriology.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Porton Down has often been accused in the press
of researching chemical and bacteriological weapons for British use. In fact,
its research has for years been concentrated on seeking antidotes to any and
all forms of gas and germ warfare that might be leveled at British and allied
troops. Unfortunately, it is impossible to develop antidotes to anything
without first studying the properties of the toxin. The two scientists from
Porton therefore had under their aegis, and in conditions of massive security,
some very nasty substances. But then so, that August 13, had Mr. Saddam Hussein.
The difference was, the Allies had no intention of using them on Iraqis, but it
was felt that Mr. Hussein might not be so forbearing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Porton men’s job would be to see if, from
lists of chemicals purchased by Iraq over a period of years, they could deduce
what he had, how much, how nasty, and if it was usable. They would also study
air photographs of a range of factories and plants in Iraq to see if any
telltale signs in the form of structures of certain size and shape—decontamination
units, emission scrubbers—might identify the poison gas factories.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now, gentlemen,” Sir Paul began, addressing
the four scientists, “the principal burden rests upon you. The rest of us will
assist and support where we can.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I have here two volumes of intelligence so far
received from our people abroad, embassy staff, trade missions, and the—ah—covert
gentlemen. Early days yet. These are the first results from the cull of export
licenses to Iraq over the past decade, and needless to say, they come from
governments that are being most promptly helpful.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have thrown the net as wide as possible.
Reference is made to exports of chemicals, building materials, laboratory
equipment, specialized engineering products—just about everything but
umbrellas, knitting wool, and cuddly toys.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Some of these exports, indeed probably the
majority, will turn out to be quite normal purchases by a developing Arab
country for peaceful purposes, and I apologize for what may turn out to be
wasted time studying them. But please concentrate not only on specialized
purchases for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, but also on
dual-use purchases—items that could be adapted or cannibalized for a purpose
other than that stated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now, I believe our American colleagues have
also been at work.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sir Paul handed one of his files to the men
from Porton Down and one to those from Aldermaston. The man from the CIA
produced two files and did the same. The bewildered scientists sat facing a
block of paperwork.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have tried,” explained Sir Paul, “not to
duplicate—the Americans and ourselves—but, alas, there may be some element of
duplication. I apologize again. And now, Mr. Sinclair.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The CIA Head of Station, unlike the Whitehall
civil servant who had almost sent the scientists to sleep with his verbosity,
was direct and to the point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The thing is, gentlemen, we may have to fight
these bastards.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This was more like it. Sinclair spoke as the
British like to think Americans speak—direct, and unafraid to mince words. The
four scientists gave him their rapt attention.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If that day ever comes, we will go in first
with air power. Like the British, we will want to lose the absolute minimum
possible in casualties. So we’ll go for their infantry, their guns, tanks, and
planes. We’ll target their SAM missile sites, communications links, command
centers. But if Saddam uses weapons of mass destruction, we would take awful
casualties, both of us. So we need to know two things.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“One, what has he got? Then we can plan for gas
masks, capes, chemical antidotes. Two, where the hell has he put it? Then we
can target the factories and the storage depots—destroy it all before he can
use it. So study the photographs, use magnifying glasses, look for the telltale
signs. We’ll keep tracing and interviewing the contractors who built him these
factories and the scientists who equipped them. That should tell us a lot. But
the Iraqis may have moved it around a bit. So it comes back to you gentlemen,
the analysts. You could get to save a lot of lives here, so give it your best
shot. Identify the WMD for us, and we’ll go in and bomb seven shits out of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four scientists were smitten. They had a
job to do, and they knew what it was. Sir Paul was looking slightly
shell-shocked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, well, I’m sure we’re all deeply grateful
to Mr. Sinclair for his—er—explanation. May I suggest we reconvene when either
Aldermaston or Porton Down has something for us?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they left the building, Simon Paxman and
Terry Martin strolled in the warm August sunshine out of Whitehall and into
Parliament Square. It was thronged with the usual columns of tourist buses.
They found an empty bench close to the marble statue of Winston Churchill,
glowering down on the impudent mortals who clustered beneath him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’ve seen the latest from Baghdad?” asked
Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saddam Hussein had just offered to pull out of
Kuwait if Israel pulled out of the West Bank and Syria out of Lebanon. An
attempt at linkage. The United Nations had rejected it out of hand. The
resolutions continued to roll out of the Security Council: cutting off Iraq’s
trade, oil exports, currency movements, air travel, resources. And the
systematic destruction of Kuwait by the occupying army went on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Any significance?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, just the usual huff and puff. Predictable.
Playing to the audience. The PLO liked it, of course, but that’s all. It’s not
a game plan.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Has he got a game plan?” asked Paxman. “If so,
no one can work it out. The Americans think he’s crazy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know. I saw Bush last night on TV.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Is he crazy, Saddam?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Like a fox.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then why doesn’t he move south into the Saudi
oil fields while he has the chance? The American buildup is only starting—ours,
too. A few squadrons, carriers in the Gulf, but nothing on the ground. Air
power alone can’t stop him. That American general they’ve just appointed ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Schwarzkopf,” said Martin. “Norman
Schwarzkopf.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the chap. He reckons he’ll need two
full months before he has the forces to stop and roll back a full-scale
invasion. So why not attack now?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because that would be attacking a fellow Arab
state with which he has no quarrel. It would bring shame. It would alienate
every Arab. It is against the culture. He wants to rule the Arab world, to be
acclaimed by it, not reviled by it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He invaded Kuwait,” Paxman pointed out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That was different. He could claim that was
correcting an imperialist injustice because Kuwait was always historically part
of Iraq. Like Nehru invading Portuguese Goa.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, come on, Terry. Saddam invaded Kuwait
because he’s bankrupt. We all know it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, that’s the real reason. But the up-front
reason is that he was reclaiming rightful Iraqi territory. Look, it happens all
over the world. India took Goa, China took Tibet, Indonesia has taken East
Timor. Argentina tried for the Falklands. Each time, the claim is retaking a
chunk of rightful territory. It’s very popular with the home crowd, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then why are his fellow Arabs turning against
him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because they think he won’t get away with it,”
said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And he <i>won’t</i> get away with it. They’re
right.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Only because of America, not because of the
Arab world. If he is to gain the acclamation of the Arab world, he must
humiliate America, not his Arabian neighbor. Have you been to Baghdad?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not recently,” said Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s full of pictures of Saddam portrayed as
the desert warrior on a white charger with raised sword. All bunkum, of course;
the man’s a back-street shooter. But that’s how he sees himself.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman rose.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s all very theoretical,’ Terry. But thanks
for your thoughts, anyway. Trouble is, I have to deal with hard facts. In any
case, no one can see how he can humiliate America. The Yanks have all the
power, all the technology. When they’re ready, they can go in there and blow
his army and air force away.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin squinted up against the sun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Casualties, Simon. America can take many
things, but she cannot take massive casualties. Saddam can. They don’t matter
to him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But there aren’t enough Americans there yet.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Precisely.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Rolls-Royce bearing Ahmed Al-Khalifa swept up to the
front of the office building that announced itself in English and Arabic as the
headquarters of Al-Khalifa Trading Corporation Ltd. and hissed to a stop.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The driver, a big manservant, half chauffeur
and half bodyguard, stepped out of the driver’s seat and went to the rear to
open the door for his master.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Perhaps it had been foolish to bring the Rolls,
but the Kuwaiti millionaire had brushed aside all pleas to use the Volvo for
fear of offending the Iraqi soldiers on the roadblocks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let them rot in hell,” he had growled over
breakfast. In fact, the drive had been uneventful from his sumptuous home in
its walled garden in the luxurious suburb of Andalus to the office building in
Shamiya.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within ten days of the invasion, the
disciplined and professional soldiers of the Iraqi Republican Guard had been
withdrawn from Kuwait City, to be replaced by the conscript rabble of the
Popular Army. If he had hated the first, he had nothing but contempt for the
latter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In their first few days, the Guards had looted
his city, but systematically and deliberately. He had seen them enter the
national bank and remove the $5 billion worth of gold bullion that constituted
the national reserve. But this was not looting for personal gain. The bullion
bars had been placed in containers, sealed in trucks, and driven to Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The gold <i>Soukh</i> had yielded another
billion dollars in solid gold artifacts, and that had gone the same way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The roadblocks of the Guards, who were
distinguishable by their black berets and general bearing, had been strict and
professional. Then, quite suddenly, they had been needed farther south, to take
up position on the southern border facing Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In their place had come the Popular Army,
ragged, unshaven, and undisciplined and, for that reason, more unpredictable and
dangerous. The occasional killing of a Kuwaiti for refusing to hand over his
watch or his car gave testimony to that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the middle of August, the heat was coming
down like a hammer on an anvil. The Iraqi soldiers, seeking shelter, ripped up
paving slabs and built themselves small stone huts down the streets they were
supposed to be checking, and crawled inside. In the cool of the dawn and the
evening they emerged to pretend to be soldiers. Then they harassed civilians and
looted food and valuables under pretense of checking cars for contraband.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mr. Al-Khalifa normally liked to be at work by
seven in the morning but by delaying until ten, when the sun was hot, he had
swept past the stone bivouacs with the Popular Army inside them and no one had
stopped him. Two soldiers, scruffy and hatless, had actually thrown up an inept
salute at the Rolls-Royce, assuming it must contain some notable of their own
side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It could not last, of course. Some thug would
steal the Rolls at gunpoint sooner or later. So what? When he had been driven
back home—he was convinced he would be, but he did not know how—he would buy
another.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He stepped out onto the pavement in gleaming
white <i>thob</i>, the light cotton material of the <i>ghutra</i>, secured
around his head with two black cords, falling about his face. The driver closed
the door and returned to the other side of the car to take it away to the
company garage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Alms, <i>sayidi</i>, alms. For one who has not
eaten for three days.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had only half seen the man squatted on the
sidewalk close to the door, apparently asleep in the sun, a sight common in any
Middle Eastern city. Now the man was beside him, a Bedou in stained robes, hand
outstretched.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His driver was striding back around the Rolls
to send the mendicant away with a stream of curses. Ahmed Al-Khalifa held up
his hand. He was a practicing Moslem who tried to abide by the teachings of the
Holy Koran, one of which is that a man should give alms as generously as he
can.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Park the car,” he ordered. From the side
pocket of his robe, he withdrew his wallet and extracted a ten-dinar note. The
Bedou took the bill in both hands, the gesture indicating that the gift of the
benefactor is so weighty that it needs two hands to support it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Shukron, sayidi, shukran</i>.” Then without
changing his tone of voice, the man added, “When you are in your office, send
for me. I have news from your son in the south.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The merchant thought he must have misheard. The
man was shuffling away down the pavement, pocketing the banknote. Al-Khalifa
entered the office building, nodded in greeting to the commissionaire, and went
up to his top-floor office in something of a daze. When he was seated at his
desk, he thought for a moment, then pressed the intercom.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There is a Bedouin tribesman on the pavement
outside. I wish to speak to him. Please send him up.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If his private secretary thought her employer
had gone mad, she gave no sign of it. Only her wrinkled nose, as she showed the
Bedou into the cool of the office five minutes later, indicated what she
thought of the personal odor of her boss’s unlikely guest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When she left, the merchant gestured to a
chair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You said you had seen my son?” he asked
shortly. He half thought the man might be here for an even bigger banknote.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, Mr. Al-Khalifa. I was with him two days
ago in Khafji.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Kuwaiti’s heart leaped. It had been two
weeks and no news. He had learned only indirectly that his only son had taken
off that morning from Ahmadi air base, and after that—nothing. None of his
contacts seemed to know what had happened. There had been much confusion that
day, August 2.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You have a message from him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, <i>sayidi</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Al-Khalifa held out his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Please give it to me. I will reward you well.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It is in my head. I could bring no paper with
me, so I memorized it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well. Please tell me what he said.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin recited the one-page letter that
the Skyhawk pilot had written, word for word.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“ ‘My dear father, despite his appearance the
man in front of you is a British officer. ...’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Al-Khalifa jerked in his chair and stared at
Martin, having some difficulty believing his eyes or ears.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“ ‘He has come into Kuwait under cover. Now
that you know this, you hold his life in your hands. I beg you to trust him, as
he must now trust you, for he will seek your help.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“ ‘I am safe and well and based with the Saudi
Air Force at Dhahran. I was able to fly one mission against the Iraqis, destroying
one tank and a truck. I will fly with the Royal Saudi Air Force until the
liberation of our country.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“ ‘Each day I pray to Allah that the hours will
speed by until I can return and embrace you again. Your dutiful son, Khaled.’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin stopped. Ahmed Al-Khalifa rose, walked
to the window, and stared out. He took several long, deep breaths. When he had
composed himself, he returned to his chair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you. Thank you. What is it you wish?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The occupation of Kuwait will not last a few
hours or a few days. It will take some months, unless Saddam Hussein can be
persuaded to pull out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Americans will not come quickly?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Americans and the British and the French
and the rest of the Coalition will need time to build up their forces. Saddam
has the fourth-largest standing army in the world, over a million men. Some are
rubbish, but many are not. This occupation force will not be dislodged by a
handful of soldiers.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well. I understand.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In the meantime, it is felt that every Iraqi
soldier and tank and gun that can be pinned down in the occupation of Kuwait
cannot be used on the frontier—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are talking of resistance, armed
resistance, fighting back,” said Al-Khalifa. “Some wild boys have tried. They
have shot at Iraqi patrols. They were gunned down like dogs.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, so I believe. They were brave but
foolish. There are ways of doing these things. The point is not to kill
hundreds, or be killed. The point is to make the Iraqi occupation army constantly
nervous, always afraid, needing to escort every officer whenever he travels,
never able to sleep in peace.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, Mr. English, I know you mean well, but I
suspect you are a man accustomed to these things and skilled at them. I am not.
These Iraqis are a cruel and savage people. We know them of old. If we do what
you say, there will be reprisals.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It is like rape, Mr. Al-Khalifa.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Rape?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When a woman is to be raped, she can fight
back or succumb. If she is docile, she will be violated, probably beaten, maybe
killed. If she fights, she will be violated, certainly beaten, maybe killed.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Kuwait is the woman, Iraq the rapist. This I
already know. So why fight back?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because there is tomorrow. Tomorrow Kuwait
will look in the mirror. Your son will see the face of a warrior.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ahmed Al-Khalifa stared at the dark-faced,
bearded Englishman for a long time, then he said:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So will his father. Let Allah have mercy on my
people. What is it you want? Money?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you, no. I have money.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had in fact ten thousand Kuwaiti dinars,
abstracted from the ambassador in London, who had drawn it from the Bank of
Kuwait, on the corner of Baker Street and George Street.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I need houses to stay in. Six of them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No problem. There are already thousands of
abandoned apartments—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not apartments. Detached villas. Apartments
have neighbors. No one will investigate a poor man engaged to caretake an
abandoned villa.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I will find them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Also identity papers. Real Kuwaiti ones. Three
in all. One for a Kuwaiti doctor, one for an Indian accountant, and one for a
market gardener from out of town.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right. I have friends in the Interior
Ministry. I think they still control the presses that produce the ID cards.
What about the picture on them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“For the market gardener, find an old man on
the street. Pay him. For the doctor and the accountant, choose men among your
staff who look roughly like me but are clean-shaven. These photographs are
notoriously bad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Lastly, cars. Three. One white station wagon,
one four-wheel-drive jeep, one old and battered pickup truck. All in lock-up
garages, all with new plates.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well, it will be done. The ID cards and
the keys to the garages and houses—where will you collect them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do you know the Christian cemetery?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Al-Khalifa frowned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ve heard of it, I’ve never been there. Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s on the Jahra road in Sulaibikhat, next to
the main Moslem cemetery. A very obscure gate with a tiny notice saying: For
Christians. Most of the tombstones are for Lebanese and Syrians, with some
Filipinos and Chinese. In the far right-hand corner is one for a merchant
seaman, Shepton. The marble slab is loose. Under it I have scraped a cavity in
the gravel. Leave them there. If you have a message for me, same thing. Check
the grave once a week for messages from me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Al-Khalifa shook his head in bewilderment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m not cut out for this sort of thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin disappeared into the maelstrom of
people who teemed through the narrow streets and alleys of the Bneid-al-Qar district.
Five days later, under Able Seaman Shepton’s tombstone he found three identity
cards, three sets of garage keys with locations, three sets of ignition keys,
and six sets of house keys with addresses on their tags.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two days later, an Iraqi truck coming back into
town from the Umm Gudayr oil field was blown to fragments by something it ran
over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Chip Barber, the head of the CIA’s Middle East Division,
had been in Tel Aviv for two days when the phone in the office they had given
him at the U.S. embassy rang. It was the CIA’s Head of Station on the line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Chip, it’s okay. He’s back in town. I fixed a
meeting for four o’clock. That gives you time to grab the last flight out of
Ben-Gurion for Stateside. The guys say they’ll come by the office and pick us
up.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Head of Station was calling from outside
the embassy, so he spoke in generalities in case the line was tapped. It was
tapped, of course, but only by the Israelis, who knew anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The “he” was General Yaacov “Kobi” Dror, head
of the Mossad; the office was the embassy itself, and the guys were the two men
from Dror’s personal staff, who arrived in an anonymous car at ten minutes
after three.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber thought fifty minutes was a lot of time
to get from the embassy compound to the headquarters of the Mossad, which is
situated in an office tower called the Hadar Dafna building on King Saul
Boulevard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But that was not where the meeting was to be.
The car sped northward out of town, past Sde Dov military airfield, until it
picked up the coastal highway to Haifa.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just outside Herzlia is situated a large
apartment-and-hotel resort called simply the Country Club. It is a place where
some Israelis but mainly elderly Jews from abroad come to relax and enjoy the
numerous health and spa facilities the place boasts. These happy folk seldom
glance up the hill above the resort.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If they did, they would see, perched on the
top, a rather splendid building commanding fine views over the surrounding
countryside and the sea. If they asked what it was, they would be told it is
the Prime Minister’s summer residence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Prime Minister of Israel is indeed
permitted to come there, one of very few who are, for this is the Mossad
training school, known inside the Mossad as the Midrasha.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Yaacov Dror received the two Americans in his
top-floor office, a light, airy room with the air conditioning turned up high.
A short, chunky man, he wore the regulation Israeli short-sleeve, open-neck
shirt and smoked the regulation sixty cigarettes a day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber was glad for the air conditioning; smoke
played havoc with his sinuses.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Israeli spy chief rose from his desk and
came lumbering forward.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Chip, my old friend, how are you these days?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He embraced the tall American in a hug. It
pleased him to rumble like a bad Jewish character actor and play the friendly,
genial bear. All an act. In previous missions as a senior operative, as a <i>katsa</i>,
he had proved he was very clever and extremely dangerous.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Chip Barber greeted him back. The smiles were
as fixed as the memories were long. And it had not been that long since an
American court had sentenced Jonathan Pollard of Navy Intelligence to a very
long prison term for spying for Israel, an operation that had certainly been
run against America by the genial Kobi Dror.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After ten minutes they came to the grist: Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let me tell you, Chip, I think you are playing
it exactly right,” said Dror, helping his guest to another cup of coffee that
would keep him awake for days. He stubbed his third cigarette into a big glass
ashtray.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber tried not to breathe but had to give up.
“If we have to go in,” he said, “if he won’t quit Kuwait and we have to go in,
we’ll start with air power.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And we’ll be going for his weapons of mass
destruction. That’s in your interest, too, Kobi. We need some cooperation here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Chip, we’ve been watching those WMDs for
years. Dammit, we’ve been warning about them. Who do you think all that poison
gas, those germ and plague bombs, are destined for? Us. We were warning and
warning, and no one took any notice. Nine years ago we blew apart his nuclear
generators at Osirak, set him back ten years in his quest for a bomb. The world
condemned us. America too.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That was cosmetic. We all know that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay, Chip, so now it’s American lives on the
line, it’s not ‘cosmetic’ anymore. Real Americans might die.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Kobi, your paranoia is showing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bullshit. Look, it suits us for you to blow
away all his poison gas plants, and his plague laboratories, and his atom bomb
research. It suits us fine. And we even get to stay out of it because now Uncle
Sam has Arab allies. So who’s complaining? Not Israel. We have passed you
everything we have on his secret weapons programs. Everything we have. No
holding back.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We need more, Kobi. Okay, maybe we neglected
Iraq a bit these past years. We had the cold war to deal with. Now it’s Iraq,
and we’re short of product. We need information—not street-level garbage, but
real, high-level paydirt. So I’m asking you straight: Do you have any asset
working for you, high in the Iraqi regime? We have questions to put, and we
need answers. And we’ll pay—we know the rules.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was silence for a while. Kobi Dror
contemplated the tip of his cigarette. The other two senior officers looked at
the table in front of them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Chip,” said Dror slowly, “I give you my word.
If we were running any agent right up inside the councils of Baghdad, I’d tell
you. I’d pass it all over. Trust me, I don’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Dror would later explain to his Prime
Minister, a very angry Itzhak Shamir, that at the time he spoke he was not
lying. But he really ought to have mentioned Jericho.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942757">Chapter 6</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin saw the youth first, or the Kuwaiti boy would
have died that day. He was driving his battered, stained, and rusty pickup
truck, its rear laden with watermelons he had bought at one of the outlying
farms near Jahra, when he saw the white-linen-dressed head pop up and down from
behind a pile of rubble by the roadside, He also caught the tip of the rifle
the boy was carrying before it disappeared behind the rubble.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The truck was serving its purpose well. He had
asked for it in its present condition because he guessed, rightly, that sooner
or later—probably sooner—the Iraqi soldiers would start confiscating
smart-looking cars for their own use.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He glanced in his rearview mirror, braked, and
swerved off the Jahra road. Coming up behind him was a truck full of soldiers
of the Popular Army.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Kuwaiti youth was trying to hold the
speeding truck in the sights of his rifle when a hard hand closed over his
mouth and another pulled the rifle away from his grip.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t think you really want to die today, do
you?” a voice growled in his ear. The truck rolled past, and the moment to take
a potshot at it vanished as well. The boy had been frightened enough by his own
actions; now he was terrified.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the truck disappeared, the grip on his
face and head relaxed. He twisted free and rolled onto his back. Crouching over
him was a tall, bearded, hard-looking Bedou.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Who are you?” he muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Someone who knows better than to kill one
Iraqi when there are twenty others in the same truck. Where’s your getaway
vehicle?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Over there,” said the boy, who appeared to be
about twenty, trying hard to grow his first beard. It was a motor scooter, on
its stand twenty yards away near some trees. The Bedou sighed. He laid down the
rifle, an old Lee Enfield .303 that the boy must have gotten from an antique
store, and walked the youth firmly to the pickup.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He drove the short distance back to the rock
pile; the rifle went under the watermelons. Then he drove to the motor scooter
and hefted it on top of the cargo of fruit. Several melons burst.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Get in,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They drove to a quiet spot near Shuwaikh Port
and stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Just what did you think you were doing?” asked
the Bedou.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The boy stared out through the fly-spotted windshield.
His eyes were moist, and his lip trembled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They raped my sister. A nurse—at the Al Adan
hospital. Four of them. She is destroyed.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Bedou nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There will be much of that,” he said. “So you
want to kill Iraqis?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, as many as I can. Before I die.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The trick is not to die. If that is what you
want, I think I had better train you, or you won’t last a day.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The boy snorted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Bedouin do not fight.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ever heard of the Arab Legion?” The youth was
silent. “And before them, Prince Faisal and the Arab Revolt? All Bedouin. Are
there any more like you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The youth turned out to be a law student,
studying at Kuwait University before the invasion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There are five of us. We all want the same. I
chose to be the first to try.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Memorize this address,” said the Bedou. He
gave it—a villa in a back street in Yarmuk. The boy got it wrong twice, then
right. Martin made him repeat it twenty times.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Seven o’clock tonight. It will be dark. But
curfew is not till ten. Arrive separately. Park at least two hundred yards away
and walk the rest. Enter at two-minute intervals. The gate and door will be
open.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He watched the boy ride away on his scooter and
sighed. Pretty basic material, he thought, but for the moment it’s all I’ve
got.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young people turned up on time. He lay <i>on
</i>a flat roof across the street and watched them. They were nervous and
unsure, glancing over their shoulders, darting into gateways, then out again.
Too many Bogart movies. When they were all inside, he gave them ten more
minutes. No Iraqi security men appeared. He slipped down from his roof, crossed
the road, and entered the house from the back. They were sitting in the main
room with the lights on and the curtains undrawn. Four young men and a girl,
dark and very intense.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were looking toward the door to the hall
when he entered from the kitchen. One minute he was not there, and the next he
was. The youngsters had one glimpse of him before he reached out and switched
off the light.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Draw the curtains,” he said quietly. The girl
did it. Woman’s work. Then he put the light back on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Never sit in a lighted room with the curtains
open,” he said. “You do not want to be seen together.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had divided his six residences into two
groups. In four he lived, flitting from one to another in no particular
sequence. Each time, he left tiny signs for himself—a leaf wedged in the
doorjamb, a tin can on the step. If ever they were missing, he would know the
house had been visited. In the other two he stored half the gear he had brought
in from its grave in the desert. The place he had chosen to meet the students
was the least important of his dwelling places, and now one he would never use
again to sleep in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were all students, except one who worked
in a bank. He made them introduce themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now you need new names.” He gave them each a
new name. “You tell no one else—not friends, parents, brothers, <i>anyone</i>—those
names. Whenever they are used, you know the message comes from one of us.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do we call you?” asked the girl, who had
just become Rana.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Bedou,” he said. “It will do. You—what is
this address again?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young man he pointed at thought, then
produced a slip of paper. Martin took it from him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No pieces of paper. Memorize everything. The
Popular Army may be stupid but the Secret Police are not. If you are frisked,
how do you explain this?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He made the three who had written down the
address burn their slips of paper.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How well do you know your city?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Pretty well,” said the oldest of them, the
twenty-five-year-old bank clerk.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not good enough. Buy maps tomorrow, street
maps. Study as if for your final exams. Learn every street and alley, every
square and garden, every boulevard and lane, every major public building, every
mosque and courtyard. You know the street signs are coming down?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They nodded. Within fifteen days of the
invasion, after recovering from their shock, the Kuwaitis were beginning a form
of passive resistance, of civil disobedience. It was spontaneous and
uncoordinated. One of the moves was the ripping down of street signs. Kuwait is
a complicated city to start with; deprived of street signs, it became a maze.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Iraqi patrols were already becoming
comprehensively lost. For the Secret Police, finding a suspect’s address was a
nightmare. At main intersections, sign posts were being ripped up in the night
or turned around.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That first night, Martin gave them two hours on
basic security. Always have a cover story that checks out, for any journey and
any rendezvous. Never carry incriminating paper. Always treat Iraqi soldiers
with respect verging on deference. Confide in no one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“From now on you are two people. One is the
original you, the one everyone knows, the student, the clerk. He is polite,
attentive, law-abiding, innocent, harmless. The Iraqis will leave him alone
because he does not threaten them. He never insults their country, their flag,
or their leader. He never comes to the attention of the AMAM. He stays alive
and free. Only on a special occasion, on a mission, does the other person
appear. He will become skilled and dangerous and still stay alive.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He taught them about security. To attend a
meeting at a rendezvous, turn up early, park well away. Go into the shadows.
Watch for twenty minutes. Look at the surrounding houses. Check for heads on
the roof, the waiting ambush party. Be alert for the scuff of a soldier’s boot
on gravel, the glow of a cigarette, the clink of metal on metal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they still had time to get home before the
curfew, he dismissed them. They were disappointed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What about the invaders? When do we start killing
them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When you know how.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Is there nothing we can do?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When the Iraqis move about, how do they do it?
Do they march?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, they use trucks, vans, jeeps, stolen cars,”
said the law student.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Which have petrol caps,” said the Bedou, “which
come off with a quick twist. Sugar lumps—twenty lumps per petrol tank. It
dissolves in the petrol, passes through the carburetor, and turns to hard
caramel in the heat of the engine. It destroys the engine. Be careful not to be
caught. Work in pairs and after dark. One keeps watch, the other slips in the
sugar. Replace the petrol cap. It takes ten seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A piece of plywood, four inches by four, with
four sharpened steel nails through it. Drop it down under your <i>thob</i> till
it slips out by your feet. Nudge it with your toe under the leading edge of the
tire of a stationary vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There are rats in Kuwait, so there are shops
that sell rat poison. Buy the white, strychnine-based kind. Buy dough from a
baker. Mix in the poison, using rubber gloves, then destroy the gloves. Bake up
the bread in the kitchen oven, but only, when you are alone in the house.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The students stared open-mouthed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have to give it to the Iraqis?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, you carry the loaves in open baskets on
scooters, or in the trunks of cars. They will stop you at roadblocks and steal
it. We meet here again in six days.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Four days later, Iraqi trucks began to break
down. Some were towed away and others abandoned, six trucks and four jeeps. The
mechanics found out why but could not discover when or by whom. Tires began to
blow out and the plywood squares were handed over to the Secret Police, who
fumed and beat up several Kuwaitis seized at random on the streets.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hospital wards began to fill with sick
soldiers, all with vomiting and stomach pain. As they were hardly ever given
food rations by their own army and lived hand-to-mouth at their roadblocks and
in their stone-slab cantonments up and down the streets, it was assumed they
had been drinking polluted water.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then at the Amiri hospital in Dasman, a Kuwaiti
lab technician ran an analysis of a sample of vomit from one of the Iraqis. He
approached his departmental chief in great perplexity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s been eating rat poison, professor. But he
says he only had bread for three days, and some fruit.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The professor was puzzled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Iraq Army bread?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, they didn’t deliver any for some days. He
took it from a passing Kuwaiti baker’s boy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where are your samples?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“On the bench, in the lab. I thought it best to
see you first.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Quite right. You have done well. Destroy them.
You have seen nothing, you understand?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The professor walked back into his office
shaking his head. Rat poison. Who the hell had thought of that?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Medusa Committee met again on August 30, because the
bacteriologist from Porton Down felt he had discovered all he could at that
point about Iraq’s germ warfare program, such as it was or appeared to be.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m afraid we are looking at somewhat slim
pickings,” Dr. Bryant told his listeners. “The main reason is that the study of
bacteriology can quite properly be carried out at any forensic or veterinary
laboratory using the same equipment that you would find in any chemical lab and
that won’t show up on export permits.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You see, the overwhelming majority of the
product is for the benefit of mankind, for the curing of diseases, not the
spreading of them. So nothing could be more natural than for a developing
country to want to study bilharzia, beri-beri, yellow fever, malaria, cholera,
typhoid, or hepatitis. These are human diseases. There is another range of animal
diseases that the veterinary colleges might quite properly want to study.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So there’s virtually no way of establishing
whether Iraq today has a germ-bomb facility or not?” asked Sinclair of the CIA.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Virtually not,” said Bryant. “There’s a record
to show that way back in 1974, when Saddam Hussein was not on the throne, so to
speak—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He was vice-president, then, and the power
behind the throne,” said Terry Martin. Bryant was flustered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, whatever. Iraq signed a contract with
the Institut Merieux in Paris to build them a bacteriological research project.
It was supposed to be for veterinary research into animal diseases, and it may
have been.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What about the stories of anthrax cultures for
use against humans?” the American asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, it’s possible. Anthrax is a particularly
virulent disease. It mainly affects cattle and other livestock, but it can
infect humans if they handle or ingest products from infected sources. You may
recall the British government experimented with anthrax on the Hebridean island
of Grainard during the Second World War. It’s still out of bounds.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That bad, eh? Where would he get this stuff?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the point, Mr. Sinclair. You’d hardly
go to a reputable European or American laboratory and say ‘Can I have some nice
anthrax cultures because I want to throw them at people?’ Anyway, he wouldn’t
need to. There are diseased cattle all over the Third World. One would only
have to note an outbreak and buy a couple of diseased carcasses. But it wouldn’t
show up on government paperwork.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So he could have cultures of this disease for
use in bombs or shells, but we don’t know. Is that the position?” asked Sir
Paul Spruce. His rolled-gold pen was poised above his note pad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s about it,” said Bryant. “But that’s the
bad news. The better news is, I doubt if it would work against an advancing
army. I suppose that if you had an army advancing against you and you were
ruthless enough, you’d want to stop them in their tracks.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s about the shape of it,” said Sinclair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, anthrax wouldn’t do that. It would
impregnate the soil if dropped from a series of air bursts above and ahead of
the army. Anything growing from that soil—grass, fruit, vegetables—would be
infected. Any beast feeding on the grass would succumb. Anyone eating the meat,
drinking the milk, or handling the hide of any such beast would catch it. But
the desert is not a good vehicle for such spore cultures. Presumably our
soldiers will be eating prepacked meals and drinking bottled water?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yep, they are already,” said Sinclair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then anthrax wouldn’t have much effect, unless
they breathed the spores in. The disease has to enter humans by ingestion into
the lungs or the food passages. Bearing in mind the gas hazard, I suspect they
will be wearing gas masks anyway.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We plan on it, yes,” replied Sinclair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So do we,” added Sir Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then I don’t really see why anthrax,” said
Bryant. “It wouldn’t stop the soldiers in their tracks, like a variety of
gases, and those who did catch it could be cured with powerful antibiotics.
There is an incubation period, you see. The soldiers could win the war and then
fall sick. Frankly, it’s a terrorist weapon rather than a military one. Now, if
you dropped a vial of anthrax concentrate in the water supply on which a city
depended, you might start a catastrophic epidemic that would overwhelm the
medical services, But if you’re going to spray something on fighting men in a
desert, I’d choose one of the various nerve gases instead. Invisible and fast.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So no indication, if Saddam has a germ warfare
lab, where it might be?” asked Sir Paul Spruce.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Frankly, I’d check with all the West’s
veterinary institutes and colleges. See if there have been any visiting
professorships or delegations to Iraq over the past ten years. Ask those who
went whether there was any facility that was absolutely off-limits to them and
surrounded by quarantine precautions. If there was, that will be it,” said
Bryant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sinclair and Paxman wrote furiously. Another
job for the checkers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Failing that,” concluded Bryant, “you could
try human intelligence. An Iraqi scientist in this field who has quit and
settled in the West. Researchers in bacteriology tend to be thin on the ground,
quite a tight group—like a village, really. We usually know what’s going on in
our own countries, even in a dictatorship like Iraq. Such a man might have
heard, if Saddam has got this facility, where he put it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, I’m sure we are deeply grateful, Dr.
Bryant,” said Sir Paul as they rose. “More work for our governments’
detectives, eh, Mr. Sinclair? I have heard that our other colleague at Porton
Down, Dr. Reinhart, will be able to give us his deductions on the matter of
poison gases in about two weeks. I shall of course stay in touch, gentlemen.
Thank you for your attendance.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The group in the desert lay quietly watching dawn steal
across the sand dunes. The youngsters had not realized when they went to the
house of the Bedou the previous evening that they would be away all night. They
had thought they would get another lecture.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had brought no warm clothing, and nights
in the desert are bitter, even at the end of August. They shivered and wondered
how they would explain their absence to their distraught parents. Caught by the
curfew? Then why not telephone? Out of order ... it would have to do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Three of the five wondered if they had made the
right choice after all, but it was too late to go back now. The Bedou had
simply told them it was time they saw some action and had led them from the
house to a rugged four-wheel-drive vehicle parked two streets away. They had
been out of town and off the road into the flat, hard desert before curfew.
Since entering the desert, they had seen no one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had driven south for twenty miles across
the sand until they intercepted a narrow road that they suspected ran from the
Manageesh oil field to their west toward the Outer Motorway in the east. All
the oil fields, they knew, were garrisoned by Iraqis and the main highways were
infested with patrols. Somewhere to their south sixteen divisions of Army and Republican
Guard were dug in, facing Saudi Arabia and the growing tide of Americans
pouring in. They felt nervous.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Three of the group lay in the sand beside the
Bedou, watching the road in the growing light. It was quite narrow. Approaching
vehicles would have to swerve to the graveled edge to pass each other.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Extending halfway across the road was a plank
studded with nails. The Bedou had taken it from his truck and laid it there,
covering it with a blanket made from old Hessian sacks. He had made them scoop
sand over the blanket until it looked just like a small drift of sand blown in
from the desert by the wind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other two pupils, the bank clerk and the
law student, were spotters. Each lay on a sand dune a hundred yards up and down
the road looking for approaching vehicles. They had been told that if the
vehicle was a large Iraqi truck or were several in number, they should wave in
a certain way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just after six, the law student waved. His
signal meant “Too much to handle.” The Bedou pulled at the fishing line he held
in his hand. The plank slithered off the road. Thirty seconds later, two trucks
crammed with Iraqi soldiers went by unharmed. The Bedou ran to the road and
replaced the plank, the sacks, and the sand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then minutes later, the bank clerk waved. It
was the right signal. From the direction of the highway a staff car came
bowling down the road toward the oil field.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The driver never thought to swerve to avoid the
bar of sand but still only caught the nails with one front wheel. It was
enough. The tire blew out, the blanket wrapped around the wheel and the car
swerved violently. The driver caught the swerve in time and steadied the car,
and it rolled to a stop half on and half off the road. The side that was off
the road bogged down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The driver sprang out of the front and two
officers emerged from the back, a major and a junior lieutenant. They shouted
at the driver, who shrugged and whined, pointing at the wheel. The jack would
never get under it—the car was at a crazy angle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To his stunned pupils the Bedou muttered, “Stay
here,” rose, and walked down the sand to the road. He had a Bedouin camel
blanket over his right shoulder, covering his right arm. He smiled broadly and
hailed the major.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Salaam aleikhem, Sayid Major</i>. I see you
have a problem. Perhaps I can help. My people are just a short distance away.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The major reached for his pistol, then relaxed.
He glowered and nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Aleikhem salaam, Bedou</i>. This spawn of a
camel has driven my car off the road.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It will have to be pulled back, <i>sayidi</i>.
I have many brothers.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The distance had closed to eight feet when the
Bedou’s arm came up. He fired in the SAS fashion, two round bursts, pause, two
rounds, pause ... The major was hit in the heart at a range of eight feet. A
slight move of the AK to the right caught the lieutenant in the breastbone,
causing him to fall on the driver, who was rising from his tattered front
wheel. When the man straightened, he was just in time to die from the third
pair of bullets in the chest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The noise of the firing seemed to echo in the
dunes, but the desert and the road were empty. He summoned the three terrified
students from their hiding places.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Put the bodies back in the car—the driver
behind the wheel, the officers in the back,” he told the two males. To the girl
he gave a short screwdriver, its blade honed to a needle point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Stab the petrol tank three times.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He looked to his spotters. They signaled
nothing was coming. He told the girl to take her handkerchief, wrap it around a
stone, knot it, and soak it in petrol. When the three bodies were back in the
car, he lit the soaking handkerchief and tossed it into the pool of petrol
spurting from the tank.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now, move.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They needed no further bidding, running through
the sand dunes to where he had parked the four-wheel-drive. Only the Bedou
thought to pick up the plank and bring it with him. As he turned into the
dunes, the main body of petrol in the burning car caught and fireballed. The
staff car disappeared in flames.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They drove back toward Kuwait in awed silence.
Two of the five were with him in the front, the other three behind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Did you see?” asked Martin at last. “Did you
watch?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, Bedou.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What did you think?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It was ... so quick,” said the girl Rana at
last.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I thought it was a long time,” said the
banker.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It was quick, and it was brutal,” said Martin.
“How long do you think we were on the road?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Half an hour?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Six minutes. Were you shocked?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, Bedou.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good. Only psychopaths are not shocked the
first time. There was an American general once, Patton. Ever heard of him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, Bedou.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He said that it was not his job to ensure that
his soldiers died for their country. It was his job to make sure the other poor
bastards died for theirs. Understand?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>George Patton’s philosophy does not translate
well into Arabic, but they worked it out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When you go to war, there is a point up to
which you can hide. After that point you have a choice. You die or he dies.
Make your choice now, all of you. You can go back to your studies or go to war.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They thought for several minutes. It was Rana
who spoke first.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I will go to war, if you will show me how,
Bedou.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After that the young men had to agree.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well. But first I will teach you how to
destroy, kill, and stay alive. My house, in two days’ time, at dawn, when
curfew is lifted. Bring school textbooks, all of you, including you, banker. If
you are stopped, be natural; you are just students going to study. True, in a
way, but different studies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You have to get off here. Find your way into
town by different trucks.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had rejoined the tarred roads and reached
the Fifth Ring Motorway. Martin pointed out a garage where trucks would stop
and the drivers would give them lifts. When they had gone, he went back to the
desert, uncovered his buried radio, drove three miles from the burial site,
opened the satellite dish, and began to talk on his encrypted Motorola to the
designated house in Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An hour after the ambush the burnt-out staff
car was found by the next patrol. The bodies were taken to the nearest
hospital, Al Adan.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The forensic pathologist who did the autopsy
under the eyes of a glowering colonel of the AMAM spotted the bullet holes—tiny
pinpricks in the sealed-over charred flesh. He was a family man, with daughters
of his own. He knew the young nurse who had been raped.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He drew the sheet back over the third body and
began to peel off his gloves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m afraid they died of asphyxia when the car
caught fire after the crash,” he said. “May Allah have mercy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The colonel grunted and left.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>At his third meeting with his band of volunteers, the
Bedou drove them far out into the desert, to a spot west of Kuwait City and
south of Jahra where they could be alone. Seated in the sand like a picnic
party, the five youngsters watched as their teacher took out a haversack and
poured out onto his camel blanket an array of strange devices. One by one he
identified them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Plastic explosive. Easy to handle, very
stable.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They went several shades paler when he squeezed
the substance in his hands like modeling clay. One of the young men, whose
father owned a tobacco shop, had brought on request a number of old cigar
boxes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This,” said the Bedou, “is a time pencil, a
detonator with timer combined. When you twist this butterfly screw at the top,
a phial of acid is crushed. The acid begins to burn its way through a copper
diaphragm. It will do so in sixty seconds. After that, the mercury fulminate
will detonate the explosive. Watch.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had their undivided attention. Taking a
piece of Semtex-H the size of a cigarette pack, he placed it in the small cigar
box and inserted the detonator into the heart of the mass.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now when you twist the butterfly like this,
all you have to do is close the box and wrap a rubber band around the box ...
so ... to hold it closed. You only do this at the last moment.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He placed the box on the sand in the center of
the circle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“However, sixty seconds is a lot longer than
you think. You have time to walk to the Iraqi truck, or bunker or half-track,
toss in the box, and walk away. Walk—never run. A running man is at once the
start of an alarm. Leave enough time to walk around one corner. Continue
walking, not running, even after you hear the explosion.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had half an eye on the watch on his wrist.
Thirty seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bedou,” said the banker.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s not a real one, is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The bomb you just made. It’s a dummy, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Forty-five seconds. He reached forward and
picked it up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, no. It’s a real one. I just wanted to show
you how long sixty seconds really is. Never panic with these things. Panic will
kill you, get you shot, just stay calm at all times.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With a deft flick of the wrist he sent the
cigar box spinning away over the dunes. It dropped behind one and exploded. The
bang rocked the sitting group, and fine sand drifted back on the wind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>High over the northern Gulf, an American AWACS
plane noted the explosion on one of its heat sensors. The operator drew it to
the attention of the mission controller, who peered at the screen. The glow
from the heat source was dying away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Intensity?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Size of a tank shell, I guess, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay. Log it. No further action.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You will be able to make these yourselves by
the end of today. The detonators and time pencils you will carry and store in
these,” the Bedou said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He took an aluminum cigar tube, wrapped the
detonator in cotton batting, and inserted it into the tube, then screwed the
top back on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The plastic you will carry like this.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He took the wrapper of a bar of soap, rolled
four ounces of explosive into the shape of a soap bar, and wrapped it, sealing
it with an inch of sticky tape.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The cigar boxes you acquire for yourselves.
Not the big kind for Havanas—the small kind for cheroots. Always keep two
cheroots in the box, in case you are stopped and frisked. If an Iraqi ever
wants to take the cigar tube or the box or the’ soap off you, let him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He made them practice under the sun until they
could unwrap the “soap,” empty out the cheroots, prepare the bomb, and wind the
rubber band around the box in thirty seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You can do it in the back of a car, the men’s
room of a café, in a doorway, or at night behind a tree,” he told them. “Pick
your target first. Make sure there are no soldiers standing well to one side
who will survive. Then twist the butterfly, close the box, rubber-band it, walk
up, toss the bomb, and walk away. From the moment you twist the butterfly,
count slowly to fifty. If at fifty seconds you have not parted company with it,
throw it as far as you can. Now, mostly you will be doing this in darkness, so
that’s what we’ll do now.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He made the group blindfold each member one by
one, then watch as the student fumbled and dropped things. By late afternoon,
they could do it by touch. In the early evening he gave them the rest of the
contents of the haversack, enough for each student to make six bars of soap and
six time pencils. The tobacconist’s son agreed to provide all the small boxes
and aluminum tubes. They could acquire cotton batting, soap wrappers, and
rubber bands for themselves. Then he drove them back to town.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Through September, AMAM headquarters in the Hilton
Hotel received a stream of reports of a steadily escalating level of attacks on
Iraqi soldiers and military equipment. Colonel Sabaawi became more and more
enraged as he became more and more frustrated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This was not the way it was supposed to be. The
Kuwaitis, he had been told, were a cowardly people who would cause no trouble—a
touch of the Baghdad methods, and they would do as they were told. It was not
working out quite like that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were in fact several resistance movements
in existence, most of them random and uncoordinated. In the Shi’a district of
Rumaithiya, Iraqi soldiers simply disappeared. The Shi’a Moslems had special
reason to loathe the Iraqis, for their coreligionists, the Shi’a of Iran, had
been slaughtered in hundreds of thousands during the Iran-Iraq war. Iraqi
soldiers who wandered into the rabbit warren of alleys that make up the
Rumaithiya district had their throats cut, and their bodies were dumped in the
sewers. They were never recovered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Among the Sunnis, the resistance was centered
in the mosques, where the Iraqis seldom ventured. Here messages were passed,
weapons swapped, and attacks planned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The most organized resistance came from the
leadership of Kuwaiti notables, men of education and wealth. Mr. Al-Khalifa
became the banker, using his funds to provide food so that the Kuwaitis could
eat, and other cargos hidden beneath the food that came in from outside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The organization aimed at six goals, five of
them a form of passive resistance, and each had its own branch. One was documentation;
every resister was supplied with perfect documentation forged by resisters
within the Interior Ministry. A second branch was for intelligence—keeping a
stream of information about Iraqi movements heading in the direction of the
Coalition headquarters in Riyadh, particularly about Iraqi manpower and weapon
strength, coastal fortifications, and missile deployments. A third branch kept
the services functioning—water, electricity, fire brigades, and health. When,
finally in defeat, Iraq turned on the oil taps and began to destroy the sea
itself, Kuwaiti oil engineers told the American fighter-bombers exactly which
valves to hit in order to turn off the flow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Community solidarity committees circulated
through all the districts, often contacting Europeans and other First World
residents still holed up in their flats and keeping them out of the way of the
Iraqi trawl nets.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A satellite phone system was smuggled in from
Saudi Arabia in the dummy fuel tank of a jeep. It was not encrypted like Martin’s,
but by keeping it constantly on the move, the Kuwaiti resistance could avoid
Iraqi detection and contact Riyadh whenever there was something to pass. An
elderly radio ham worked throughout the occupation, sending seven thousand
messages to another ham in Colorado, which were passed on to the State
Department.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And there was the offensive resistance, mainly
under the leadership of a Kuwaiti colonel who had escaped the Ministry of
Defense building on the first day. Because he had a son called Fouad, his code
name was Abu Fouad, or Father of Fouad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saddam Hussein had finally given up trying to
form a puppet government and appointed his half-brother Ali Hassan Majid as
Governor-General.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The resistance was not just a game. A small but
extremely dirty war developed underground. The AMAM responded by setting up two
interrogation centers, at the Kathma Sports Center and the Qadisiyah Stadium.
Here the methods of AMAM chief Omar Khatib were imported from the Abu Ghraib
prison outside Baghdad and used extensively. Before the liberation, five
hundred Kuwaitis were dead, of whom two hundred fifty were executed, many after
prolonged torture.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Counterintelligence chief Hassan Rahmani sat at
his desk in the Hilton Hotel and read the reports prepared by his on-the-spot
staff. He was making a brief visit from his Baghdad duties on September 15. The
reports made gloomy reading.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a steady increase in attacks on Iraqi
outposts on lonely roads, guard huts, vehicles, and roadblocks. This was mainly
the AMAM’s problem—local resistance came under them, and—predictably, in
Rahmani’s view—that brutal oaf Khatib was making a camel’s breakfast out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani had little time for the torture to
which his rival in the Iraqi intelligence structure was so devoted. He
preferred to rely on patient detective work, deduction, and cunning, even
though he had to concede that in Iraq it was terror and nothing else that had
kept the Rais in power all these years. He had to admit, with all his
education, that the street-wise, devious psychopath from the alleys of Tikrit
frightened him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had tried to persuade his president to let
him have charge of internal intelligence in Kuwait, but the answer had been a
firm no. It was a question of principle, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had
explained to him. He, Rahmani, was charged to protect the state from espionage
and sabotage from foreign sources. The Rais would not concede that Kuwait was a
foreign country—it was the nineteenth province of Iraq. So it was Omar Khatib’s
job to ensure compliance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As he contemplated his sheaf of reports that
morning in the Hilton Hotel, Rahmani was rather relieved that he did not have
the task. It was a nightmare, and as he had predicted, Saddam Hussein had
played his cards consistently wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The taking of Western hostages as human shields
against attack was proving a disaster, totally counterproductive. He had missed
his chance to roll south and take the Saudi oil fields, forcing King Fahd to
the conference table, and now the Americans were pouring into the theater.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All attempts to assimilate Kuwait were failing,
and within a month, probably less, Saudi Arabia would be impregnable with its
American shield along the northern border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saddam Hussein, he believed, could neither get
out of Kuwait without humiliation, nor stay in there if attacked without a
bigger one. Yet the mood around the Rais was still one of confidence, as if he
were convinced something would turn up. What on earth did the man expect?
Rahmani wondered. That Allah himself would lean down from heaven and smash his
enemies in the face?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani rose from his desk and walked to the
window. He liked to stroll as he thought; it marshaled his brain. He looked
down from the window. The once-sparkling marina was now a garbage dump.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was something about the reports on his
desk that disturbed him. He went back and scanned them again. Yes, something
odd. Some of the attacks on Iraqis were with handguns and rifles; others with
bombs made from industrial TNT. But here were others, a constant niggling
stream, that clearly indicated that a plastic explosive had been used. Kuwait
had never had plastic explosives, least of all Semtex-H. So who was using it,
and where did they get it?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then there were radio reports of an encrypted
transmitter somewhere out in the desert that moved all the time, coming on air
at different times, talking scrambled nonsense for ten or fifteen minutes and
then going silent, and always on different bearings.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then there were these reports of a strange
Bedou who seemed to wander about at will, appearing, disappearing, and
reappearing, and always a trail of destruction in his wake. Before they died of
wounds, two badly injured soldiers had reported seeing the man, tall and
confident in a red-and-white checkered <i>keffiyeh</i>, one trailing end drawn
across his face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two Kuwaitis under torture had mentioned the
legend of the invisible Bedou but claimed they had never actually seen him.
Sabaawi’s men were trying to persuade the prisoners with even more pain to
admit they had. Fools. Of course, they would invent anything to stop the agony.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The more Hassan Rahmani thought about it, the
more he became convinced that he had a foreign infiltrator on his hands,
definitely part of his authority. He found it hard to believe that there was
any Bedou who knew about plastic explosives and encrypted transceivers—if they
were from the same man. He might have trained up a few bomb planters, but he
also seemed to be carrying out a lot of the attacks himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It would just not be possible to pick up every
Bedou wandering around the city and the desert—that would be the AMAM way, but
they would be pulling out fingernails for years and getting nowhere.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For Rahmani, the problem resolved itself into
three choices: Capture the man during one of his attacks—but that would be
haphazard and possibly never happen. Capture one of his Kuwaiti associates and
trace the man to his lair. Or take him crouched over his transmitter in the
desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani decided on the last. He would bring in
from Iraq two or three of his best radio-detector teams, post them at different
points, and try to triangulate on the source of the broadcast. He would also
need an Army helicopter on standby, with a team of Special Forces ready to
move. As soon as he got back to Baghdad, he would set it in motion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Hassan Rahmani was not the only man that day in Kuwait who
was interested in the Bedou. In a suburban villa miles away from the Hilton, a
handsome, moustached young Kuwaiti Army colonel in a white cotton <i>thob</i>
sat in an armchair and listened to a friend who had come to him with an
interesting snippet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I was just sitting in my car at the traffic
light, watching nothing in particular, when I noticed this Iraqi Army truck on
the opposite side of the intersection. It was parked there, with a group of
soldiers around the hood, eating and smoking. Then a young man, one of our own,
walked out of a café clutching what looked like a tiny box. It was really
small. I thought nothing of it until I saw him flick it under the truck. Then
he turned the corner and disappeared. The lights changed, but I stayed where I
was.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In five seconds the truck disintegrated. I
mean, it just blew apart. The soldiers were all on the ground with their legs
off. I’ve never seen such a small package do so much damage. I tell you, I hung
a U and got out of there before the AMAM came along.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Plastic,” mused the Army officer. “What would
I not give for some of that. It must have been one of the Bedou’s men. Who is
that bastard, anyway? I’d love to meet him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The point is, I recognized the boy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What?” The young colonel leaned forward, his
face alight with interest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I wouldn’t have come all this way just to tell
you what you will have heard already. I tell you, I recognized the
bomb-thrower. Abu Fouad, I’ve been buying cigarettes from his father for years.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dr. Reinhart, when he addressed the Medusa Committee in
London three days later, looked tired. Even though he had relinquished all his
other duties at Porton Down, the documentation he had taken away with him from
the first meeting and the supplementary information that had come pouring in
ever since had given him a monstrous task.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The study is probably not yet complete,” he
said, “but a fairly comprehensive picture emerges.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“First, of course, we know that Saddam Hussein
has a large poison-gas-production capacity, I estimate at over a thousand tons
a year.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“During the Iran-Iraq war, some Iranian
soldiers who had been gassed were treated here in Britain, and I was able to
examine them. We could recognize phosgene and mustard gas even then.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The worse news is that I have no doubt that
Iraq now has substantial supplies of two far more lethal gases, nerve agents of
German invention called Sarin and Tabun. If these were used in the Iran-Iraq
war, and I think they were, there would have been no question of treating the
victims in British hospitals. They would be dead.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How bad are these—er ... agents, Dr. Reinhart?”
asked Sir Paul Spruce.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sir Paul, do you have a wife?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The urbane mandarin was startled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, yes, as a matter of fact I do.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Does Lady Spruce ever use perfume from a spray
atomizer?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, I do believe I have seen her do that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Have you ever noticed how fine the spray from
an atomizer is? How small the droplets?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, indeed, and bearing in mind the price of
perfume, I’m very glad of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a good joke. Anyway, Sir Paul liked it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Two of those droplets of Sarin or Tabun on
your skin, and you’re dead,” said the chemist from Porton Down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No one smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Iraqi search for nerve gases goes back to
1976. In that year they approached the British company ICI, explaining they
wanted to build a pesticide plant to produce four bug-killers—but the materials
they asked for caused ICI to turn them down flat. The specifications the Iraqis
showed were for corrosion-resistant reactor vessels, pipes, and pumps that
convinced ICI that the real end-goal was not chemical pesticides but nerve gas.
The deal was refused.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank God for that,” said Sir Paul, and made a
note.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But not everyone refused them,” said the
former Viennese refugee. “Always the excuse was that Iraq needed to produce
herbicides and pesticides, which of course need poisons.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They could not have really wanted to produce
these agricultural products?” asked Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No chance,” said Reinhart. “To a professional
chemist, the key lies in the quantities and the types. In 1981 they got a
German firm to build them a laboratory with a very special and unusual layout.
It was to produce phosphorus pentachloride, the starter chemical for organic
phosphorus, which is one of the ingredients of nerve gas. No normal university
research laboratory would need to handle such hideously toxic substances. The
chemical engineers involved must have known that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Further export licenses show orders for
thiodiglycol. Mustard gas is made from it when mixed with hydrochloric acid.
Thiodiglycol, in small quantities, may be used also for making the ink for
ball-point pens.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How much did they buy?” asked Sinclair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Five hundred tons.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s a lot of ball-points,” muttered Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That was in early 1983,” said Reinhart. “In
the summer their big Samarra poison gas plant went into operation, producing
yperite, which is mustard gas. They began using it on the Iranians in December.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“During the first attacks by the Iranian human
waves, the Iraqis used a mixture of yellow rain, yperite, and Tabun. By 1985,
they had improved the mixture to one of hydrogen cyanide, mustard gas, Tabun,
and Sarin, achieving a sixty percent mortality rate among the Iranian infantry.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Could we just look at the nerve gases, Doctor?”
asked Sinclair. “That would seem to be the really deadly stuff.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It is,” said Dr. Reinhart. “From 1984, the
chemicals for which they were shopping were phosphorus oxychloride, which is an
important precursor chemical for Tabun, and two Sarin precursors, trimethyl
phosphite and potassium fluoride. Of the first of those three, they tried to
order 150 tons from a Dutch company. That’s enough pesticide to kill every
tree, shrub, and blade of grass in the Middle East. The Dutch turned them down,
as ICI had, but they still bought two uncontrolled chemicals at that time:
dimethylamine for making Tabun, and isopropanol for Sarin.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If they were uncontrolled in Europe, why could
they not be used for pesticides?” asked Sir Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because of the quantities,” Dr. Reinhart
replied, “and the chemical manufacturing and handling equipment, and the
factory layouts. To a skilled chemist or chemical engineer, none of these
purchases could be other than for poison gas.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do you know who the main supplier over the
years has been, doctor?” asked Sir Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, yes. There was some input of a scientific
nature from the Soviet Union and East Germany in the early days, and some
exports from about eight countries, in most cases of small quantities of
uncontrolled chemicals. But eighty percent of the plants, layouts, machinery,
special handling equipment, chemicals, technology, and know-how came from West
Germany.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Actually,” drawled Sinclair, “we’ve been
protesting to Bonn for years. They always trashed the protests. Doctor, can you
identify the chemical gas plants on those photos we gave you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, of course. Some factories are identified
in the paperwork. Others you can see with a magnifying glass.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The chemist spread five large aerial photos on
the table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I do not know the Arab names, but these numbers
identify the photographs for you, do they not?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. You just point out the buildings,” said
Sinclair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Here, the whole complex of seventeen buildings
... here, this big single plant—you see the air scrubber unit? And here, this
one ... and this whole complex of eight buildings ... and this one.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sinclair studied a list from his attaché case.
He nodded grimly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“As we thought. Al Qaim, Fallujah, Al-Hillah,
Salman Pak, and Samarra. Doctor, I’m very very grateful to you. Our guys in the
States figured out exactly the same. They’ll all be targeted for the first wave
of attacks.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the meeting broke up Sinclair, with Simon
Paxman and Terry Martin, strolled up to Piccadilly and had a coffee at Richoux.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t know about you guys,” said Sinclair as
he stirred his cappuccino, “but for us the bottom line is the gas threat.
General Schwarzkopf is convinced already. That’s what he calls the nightmare
scenario: mass gas attacks, a rain of airbursts over all our troops. If they
go, they’ll go in masks and gas capes, head to foot. The good news is, this gas
doesn’t live long once it’s exposed to air. It touches the desert, it’s dead.
Terry, you don’t look convinced.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This rain of airbursts,” said Martin. “How’s
Saddam supposed to launch them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sinclair shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Artillery barrage, I guess. That’s what he did
against the Iranians.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re not going to pulp his artillery? It’s
only got a range of thirty kilometers. Must be out there in the desert
somewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sure,” said the American, “we have the
technology to locate every gun and tank out there, despite the digging-in and
the camouflage.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So if his guns are broken, how else does
Saddam launch the gas rain?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Fighter-bombers, I guess.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But you’ll have destroyed them too, by the
time the ground forces move,” Martin pointed out. “Saddam will have nothing
left flying.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay, so Scud missiles—whatever. That’s what
he’ll try. And we’ll waste them one by one. Sorry, guys, gotta go.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What are you getting at, Terry?” asked Paxman
when the CIA man had gone. Terry Martin sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, I don’t know. It’s just that Saddam and
his planners will know all that. They won’t underestimate American air power.
Simon, can you get me all Saddam’s speeches over the past six months? In Arabic—must
be in Arabic.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, I suppose so. GCHQ in Cheltenham will
have them, or the BBC Arabic Service. On tape or transcript?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Tape if possible.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For three days Terry Martin listened to the
guttural, haranguing voice out of Baghdad. He played and replayed the tapes and
could not get rid of the nagging worry that the Iraqi despot was making the
wrong noises for a man in such deep trouble. Either he did not know or
recognize the depth of his trouble, or he knew something that his enemies did
not.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On September 21, Saddam Hussein made a new
speech, or rather a statement from the Revolutionary Command Council, that used
his own particular vocabulary. In the statement he declared there was not the
slightest chance of any Iraqi retreat from Kuwait, and that any attempt to
eject Iraq would lead to “the mother of all battles.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That was how it had been translated. The media
had loved it, and the words became quite a catchphrase.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dr. Martin studied the text and then called
Simon Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ve been looking at the vernacular of the
Upper Tigris valley,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good God, what a hobby,” replied Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The point is, the phrase he used, ‘the mother
of all battles.’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, what about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The word translated as ‘battle.’ Where he
comes from, it also means ‘casualty’ or ‘bloodbath.’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was silence down the line for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But despite that, Terry Martin did.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942758">Chapter 7</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The tobacconist’s son was frightened, and so was his
father.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“For pity’s sake, tell them what you know, my
son,” he begged the boy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two-man delegation from the Kuwait
Resistance Committee had been perfectly polite when they introduced themselves
to the tobacconist, but were quite insistent that they wished his son to be
frank and truthful with them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The shopkeeper, though he knew the visitors had
given him pseudonyms instead of their real names, had enough wit to realize he
was talking to powerful and influential members of his own people. Worse, it
had come as a total surprise to him to learn that his son was involved in
active resistance at all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Worst of all, he had just learned that his
offspring was not even with the official Kuwaiti resistance but had been seen
tossing a bomb under an Iraqi truck at the behest of some strange bandit of
whom he had never heard. It was enough to give any father a heart attack.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four of them sat in the drawing room of the
tobacconist’s comfortable house in Keifan while one of the visitors explained
that they had nothing against the Bedou but simply wished to contact him so
that they could collaborate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So the boy explained what had happened from the
moment his friend had been pulled down behind a pile of rubble at the moment he
was about to fire at a speeding Iraqi truck. The men listened in silence, only
the questioner occasionally interjecting with another query. It was the one who
said nothing, the one in dark glasses, who was Abu Fouad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The questioner was particularly interested in
the house where the group met with the Bedou. The boy gave the address, then
added:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I do not think there is much point in going
there. He is extremely watchful. One of us went there once to try and talk to
him, but the place was locked. We do not think he lives there, but he knew we
had been there. He told us never to do that again. If it ever happened, he
said, he would break contact, and we would never see him again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sitting in his corner, Abu Fouad nodded in
approval. Unlike the others, he was a trained soldier, and he thought he
recognized the hand of another trained man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When will you meet him next?” he asked
quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a possibility that the boy could pass
a message, an invitation to a parley.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nowadays, he contacts one of us. The contacted
one brings the rest. It may take some time.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two Kuwaitis left. They had descriptions of
two vehicles: a battered pickup apparently in the disguise of a market gardener
bringing his fruit into town from the countryside, and a powerful
four-wheel-drive for journeys into the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abu Fouad ran the numbers of both vehicles past
a friend in the Ministry of Transportation, but the trace ran out. Both numbers
were fictional. The only other lead was through the identity cards that the man
would have to carry to pass those ubiquitous Iraqi roadblocks and checkpoints.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Through his committee he contacted a civil
servant in the Interior Ministry. He was lucky. The man recalled running off a
phony identity card for a market gardener from Jahra. It was a favor he had
done for the millionaire Ahmed Al-Khalifa six weeks earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abu Fouad was elated and intrigued. The
merchant was an influential and respected figure in the movement. But it had
always been thought that he was strictly confined to the financial,
noncombatant side of things. What on earth was he doing as the patron of the
mysterious and lethal Bedou?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>South of the Kuwaiti border, the incoming tide of American
weaponry rolled on. As the last week of September slid by, General Norman
Schwarzkopf, buried in the rabbit warren of secret chambers two floors below
the Saudi Defense Ministry on Old Airport Road in Riyadh, finally realized that
he had enough strength at last to declare Saudi Arabia safe from Iraqi attack.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the air, General Charles “Chuck” Horner had
built an umbrella of constantly patrolling steel, a fast-moving and amply
provisioned armada of air-superiority fighters, ground-attack fighter-bombers,
air-to-air refueling tankers, heavy bombers, and tank-busting Thunderbolts,
enough to destroy the incoming Iraqis on the ground and in the air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had airborne technology that could and did
cover by radar every square inch of Iraq, that could sense every movement of
heavy metal rolling on the roads, moving through the desert, or trying to take
to the air, that could listen to every Iraqi conversation on the airwaves and
pinpoint any source of heat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the ground, Norman Schwarzkopf knew he now
had enough mechanized units, light and heavy armor, artillery, and infantry to
receive any Iraqi column, hold it, surround it, and liquidate it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the last week of September, in conditions of
such total secrecy that not even its Allies were told, the United States made
its plans to move from defensive role to offensive. The assault on Iraq was
planned, even though the United Nations mandate was still limited to securing
the safety of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, and only that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But he also had problems. One was that the
number of Iraqi troops, guns, and tanks deployed against him was double the
number when he had arrived in Riyadh six weeks earlier. Another problem was
that he would need double the amount of Coalition forces to liberate Kuwait
than that needed to secure Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Norman Schwarzkopf was a man who took George
Patton’s dictum very seriously: One dead American or Brit or Frenchie or any
other Coalition soldier or airman was one too many. Before he would go in, he
would want two things: twice the amount of force he presently had, and an air
assault guaranteed to “degrade” by fifty percent the strength of the Iraqi
forces arrayed north of the border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That meant more time, more equipment, more
stores, more guns, more tanks, more troops, more airplanes, more fuel, more
food, and a lot more money. Then he told the stunned armchair Napoleons on
Capitol Hill that if they wanted a victory, they had better let him have it
all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Actually, it was the more urbane Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell, who passed the message on, but
he softened the language a bit. Politicians love to play the games of soldiers,
but they hate to be addressed in the language of soldiers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So the planning in that last week of September
was utterly secret. As it turned out, it was just as well. The United Nations,
leaking peace plans at every seam, would wait until November 29 before giving
the go-ahead to the Coalition to use all necessary force to evict Iraq from
Kuwait unless she quit by January 15. Had planning started at the end of
November, it could never have been completed in time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Ahmed Al-Khalifa was deeply embarrassed. He knew Abu
Fouad, of course, who and what he was. Further, he sympathized with his
request. But he had given his word, he explained, and he could not go back on
it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Not even to his fellow-Kuwaiti and
fellow-resister did he reveal that the Bedou was in fact a British officer. But
he did agree to leave a message for the Bedou in a place he knew the man would
find it sooner or later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The following morning he left a letter, with
his personal recommendation urging the Bedou to agree to meet Abu Fouad, under
the marble tombstone of Able Seaman Shepton in the Christian cemetery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>There were six soldiers in the group, headed by a sergeant,
and when the Bedou came around the corner, they were as surprised as he.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin had parked his small truck in the
lock-up garage and was making his way across the city on foot toward the villa
he had chosen for that night. He was tired, and unusually, his alertness was
blunted. When he saw the Iraqis and knew they had seen him, he cursed himself.
In his job, men can die for a moment’s lack of alertness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was well after curfew, and though he was
quite used to moving through the city when it was deserted of law-abiding
citizens and only the Iraqi patrols were on the prowl, he made a point of
moving through the ill-lit side streets, across the darkened patches of waste
ground, and down the black alleys, just as the Iraqis made a point of sticking
to the main highways and intersections. That way, they never troubled each
other.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But following Hassan Rahmani’s return to
Baghdad and his vitriolic report on the uselessness of the Popular Army, some
changes were taking place. The Green Berets of the Iraqi Special Forces had
begun to appear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though not classed with the elite Republican
Guard, the Green Berets were at least more disciplined than the rabble of
conscripts called the Popular Army. It was six of these who stood quietly by
their truck at a road junction where normally there would have been no Iraqis.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin just had time to lean heavily on the
stick he carried with him and adopt the posture of an old man. It was a good
posture, for in the Arab culture the old are given respect or at least,
compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hey, you,” shouted the sergeant. “Come over
here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were four assault rifles trained on the
lone figure in the checkered <i>keffiyeh</i>. The old man paused, then hobbled
forward.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What are you doing out at this hour, Bedou?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Just an old man trying to get to his home
before the curfew, <i>sayidi</i>,” the man whined.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s past the hour of curfew, fool! Two hours
past.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man shook his head in bewilderment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I didn’t know, <i>sayidi</i>. I have no watch.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the Middle East watches are not
indispensable, just highly prized, a sign of prosperity. Iraqi soldiers
arriving in Kuwait soon acquired them—they just took them. But the word <i>Bedouin</i>
comes from <i>bidun</i>, meaning “without.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sergeant grunted. The excuse was possible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Papers,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man used his spare hand to pat his
soiled robe.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I seem to have lost them,” he pleaded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Frisk him,” said the sergeant. One of the
soldiers moved forward. The hand grenade strapped to the inside of Martin’s
left thigh felt like one of the watermelons from his truck.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t you touch my balls,” said the old Bedou
sharply. The soldier stopped. One in the back let out a giggle. The sergeant
tried to keep a straight face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, go on, Zuhair. Frisk him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young soldier Zuhair hesitated,
embarrassed. He knew the joke was on him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Only my wife is allowed to touch my balls,”
said the Bedou. Two of the soldiers let out a guffaw and lowered their rifles.
The rest did the same. Zuhair still held back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mind you, it doesn’t do her any good. I’m long
past that sort of thing,” said the old man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was too much. The patrol roared with
laughter. Even the sergeant grinned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, old man. On your way. And don’t
stay out again after dark.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Bedou limped off to the corner of the
street, scratching under his clothes. At the corner he turned. The grenade,
priming arm sticking clumsily out to one side, skittered across the cobbles and
came to rest against the toe-cap of Zuhair. All six stared at it. Then it went
off. It was the end of the six soldiers. It was also the end of September.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That night, far away in Tel Aviv, General Kobi Dror of the
Mossad sat in his office in the Hadar Dafna building, taking a late-night drink
after work with an old friend and colleague, Shlomo Gershon, always known as
Sami.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sami Gershon was head of the Mossad’s
Combatants or Komemiute Division, the section responsible for running illegal
agents, the dangerous cutting edge of espionage. He had been one of the other
two present when his chief had lied to Chip Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You don’t think we should have told them?”
Gershon asked, because the subject had come up again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dror swirled his beer in the bottle and took a
swig. “Screw them,” he growled. “Let them recruit their own bloody assets.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As a teenage soldier in the spring of 1967,
Dror had crouched under his Patton tank in the desert and waited while four
Arab states prepared to settle accounts with Israel once and for all. He still
recalled how the outside world had confined itself to muttering, “Tut tut.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With the rest of his crew, commanded by a
twenty-year-old, he had been one of those under Israel Tal who had punched a
hole straight through the Mitla Pass and driven the Egyptian Army back to the
Suez Canal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And he recalled how, when Israel had destroyed
four armies and four air forces in six days, the same Western media that had
wrung its hands at his country’s impending obliteration in May had accused
Israel of bully-boy tactics by winning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From then on, Kobi Dror’s philosophy had been
made: Screw them all. He was a sabra, born and raised in Israel, and had none
of the breadth of vision nor forbearance of people like David Ben-Gurion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His political loyalty lay with the far-right
Likud Party, with Menachem Begin, who had been in the Irgun, and Itzhak Shamir,
formerly of the Stern Gang.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Once, sitting at the back of a classroom,
listening to one of his staff lecture the new recruits, he had heard the man
use the phrase “friendly intelligence agencies.” He had risen and taken over
the class.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There is no such thing as a friend of Israel,
except maybe a diaspora Jew,” he told them. “The world is divided into two: our
enemies and neutrals. Our enemies we know how to deal with. As for neutrals,
take everything, give nothing. Smile at them, slap them on the back, drink with
them, flatter them, thank them for their tipoffs, and tell them nothing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, Kobi, let’s hope they never find out,”
said Gershon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How can they? There’s only eight of us who
know. And we’re all in the Office.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It must have been the beer. He was overlooking
someone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the spring of 1988 a British businessman called Stuart
Harris was attending an industrial fair in Baghdad. He was sales director of a
company in Nottingham that made and sold road-grading equipment. The fair was
under the auspices of the Iraqi Ministry of Transport. Like almost all Westerners,
he had been staying at the Rashid Hotel on Yafa Street, which had been built
mainly for foreigners and was always under surveillance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the third day of the exhibition, Harris had
returned to his room to find a plain envelope pushed under his door. It had no
name on it, just his room number, and the number was correct.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside was a single sheet of paper and another
completely plain envelope of the airmail type. The slip of paper said in
English and in block capitals: “On your return to London pass this envelope
unopened to Norman at the Israeli embassy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That was all. Stuart Harris had been
panic-stricken, terrified. He knew the reputation of Iraq, of its dreaded
Secret Police. Whatever was in the plain envelope could get him arrested,
tortured, even killed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To his credit, he kept cool, sat down, and
tried to work things out. Why him? for example. There were scores of British
businessmen in Baghdad. Why pick Stuart Harris? They could not know he was
Jewish, that his father had arrived in England in 1935 from Germany as Samuel
Horowitz, could they?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though he would never find out, there had been
a conversation two days earlier in the fairground canteen between two
functionaries of the Iraqi Transportation Ministry. One had told the other of
his visit to the Nottingham works the previous autumn; how Harris had been his
host on the first and second days, then disappeared for a day, then come back.
He—the Iraqi—had asked if Harris was ill. It was a colleague who had laughed
and told him Harris had been off for Yom Kippur.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two Iraqi civil servants thought nothing
more of it, but someone at the next booth did. He reported the conversation to
his superior. The senior man appeared to take no notice but later became quite
thoughtful and ran a check on Mr. Stuart Harris of Nottingham, establishing his
room number at the Rashid.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Harris sat and wondered what on earth to do.
Even if, he reasoned, the anonymous sender of the letter had discovered he was
Jewish, there was one thing they could not have known. No way. By an
extraordinary coincidence, Stuart Harris was a <i>sayan</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Israeli Institute for Intelligence and
Special Operations, founded in 1951 on the order of Ben-Gurion himself, is
known outside its own walls as the Mossad, Hebrew for “Institute.” Inside its
walls it is never, ever called that, but always “the Office.” Among the leading
intelligence agencies of the world, it is by far the smallest. In terms of
on-the-payroll staff, it is tiny. The CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia,
has about 25,000 employees on its staff, and that excludes all the outstations.
At its peak the KGB’s First Chief Directorate, responsible like the CIA and
Mossad for foreign intelligence-gathering, had 15,000 case officers around the
world, some three thousand based at the Yazenevo headquarters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Mossad has only between 1,200 and 1,500
employees at any time and fewer than forty case officers, called <i>katsas</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That it can operate on such a slim budget and
tiny staff and secure the “product” that it does depends on two factors. One is
its ability to tap into the Israeli population at will—a population still
amazingly cosmopolitan and containing a bewildering variety of talents,
languages, and geographical origins.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other factor is an international network of
helpers or assistants, in Hebrew <i>sayanim</i>. These are diaspora Jews (they
must be wholly Jewish on both sides) who, although probably loyal to the
country in which they reside, will also sympathize with the State of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There are two thousand <i>sayanim </i>in London
alone, five thousand in the rest of Britain, and ten times that number in the
United States. They are never brought into operations, just asked for favors.
And they must be convinced that the help they are asked to give is not for an
operation against their country of birth or adoption. Conflicting loyalties are
not allowed. But they enable operational costs to be cut by a factor of up to
ten.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For example: A Mossad team arrives in London to
mount an operation against a Palestinian undercover squad. They need a car. A
used car <i>sayan</i> is asked to leave a legitimate secondhand car at a
certain place with the keys under the mat. It is returned later, after the
operation. The <i>sayan</i> never knows what it was used for; his books say it
was out to a possible customer on approval.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The same team needs a “front.” A
property-owning <i>sayan </i>lends an empty shop, and a confectionery <i>sayan </i>stocks
it with sweets and chocolates. They need a mail drop; a real estate <i>sayan</i>
lends the keys to a vacant office on his roster.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stuart Harris had been on vacation at the
Israeli resort of Eilat when, at the bar of the Red Rock, he fell into
conversation with a pleasant young Israeli who spoke excellent English. At a
later conversation, the Israeli brought a friend, an older man, who quietly
elicited from Harris where his feelings toward Israel lay. By the end of the
vacation, Harris had agreed that, if there was ever anything he could do ...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the end of the vacation Harris went home as
advised and got on with his life. For two years he waited for the call, but no
call ever came. However, a friendly visitor kept periodically in touch—one of
the more tiresome jobs of <i>katsas</i> on foreign assignment is to keep tabs
on the <i>sayanim</i> on their list.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So Stuart Harris sat in a wave of rising panic
in the hotel room in Baghdad and wondered what to do. The letter could well be
a provocation—he would be intercepted at the airport trying to smuggle it out.
Slip it into someone else’s bag? He did not feel he could do that. And how
would he recover it in London?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, he calmed down, worked out a plan, and
did it exactly right. He burned the outer envelope and the note in an ashtray,
crushed the embers, and flushed them down the toilet. Then he hid the plain
envelope under the spare blanket on the shelf above the wardrobe, having first
wiped it clean.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If his room were raided, he would simply swear
he had never needed the blanket, never climbed to the top shelf, and the letter
must have been left by a previous occupant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In a stationery shop he bought a stout manila
envelope, an adhesive label, and sealing tape; from a post office, enough
stamps to send a magazine from Baghdad to London. He abstracted a promotional
magazine extolling the virtues of Iraq from the trade fair and even had the
empty envelope stamped with the exhibition logo.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the last day, just before leaving for the
airport with his two colleagues, he retired to his room. He slipped the letter
into the magazine and sealed them in the envelope. He addressed it to an uncle
in Long Eaton and stuck on the label and the stamps. In the lobby, he knew, was
a mailbox, and the next pickup was in four hours. Even if the envelope were
steamed open by goons, he reasoned, he would be over the Alps in a British
airliner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It is said that luck favors the brave or the
foolish or both. The lobby <i>was </i>under surveillance by men from the AMAM,
watching to see if any departing foreigner was approached by an Iraqi trying to
slip him something. Harris carried his envelope under his jacket and beneath
his left armpit. A man behind a newspaper in the corner was watching, but a
trolley of baggage rolled between them as Harris dropped the envelope into the
mailbox. When the watcher saw him again, Harris was at the desk handing in his
key.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The brochure arrived at his uncle’s house a
week later. Harris had known his uncle was away on vacation, and as he had a
key in case of fire or burglary, he used it to slip in and retrieve his
package. Then he took it down to the Israeli embassy in London and asked to see
his contact. He was shown into a room and told to wait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A middle-aged man entered and asked his name
and why he wanted to see “Norman.” Harris explained, took the airmail envelope
from his pocket, and laid it on the table. The Israeli diplomat went pale, asked
him to wait again, and left.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The embassy building at 2 Palace Green is a
handsome structure, but its classical lines give no indication of the wealth of
fortifications and technology that conceals the Mossad London Station in the
basement. It was from this underground fortress that a younger man was summoned
urgently. Harris waited and waited.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though he did not know it, he was being studied
through a one-way mirror as he sat there with the envelope on the table in
front of him. He was also being photographed, while records were checked to
ensure he really was a <i>sayan</i> and not a Palestinian terrorist. When the
photograph of Stuart Harris of Nottingham from the files checked with the man
behind the one-way mirror, the young <i>katsa</i> finally entered the room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He smiled, introduced himself as Rafi, and
invited Harris to start his story at the very beginning, right back in Eilat.
So Harris told him. Rafi knew all about Eilat (he had just read the entire
file), but he needed to check. When the narrative reached Baghdad, he became
interested. He had few queries at first, allowing Harris to narrate in his own
time. Then the questions came, many of them, until Harris had relived all he
had done in Baghdad several times. Rafi took no notes; the whole thing was
being recorded. Finally he used a wall phone to have a muttered conversation in
Hebrew with a senior colleague next door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His last act was to thank Stuart Harris
profusely, congratulate him on his courage and cool head, exhort him never to
mention the entire incident to <i>anyone</i>, and wish him safe journey back
home. Then Harris was shown out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A man with antiblast helmet, flak-jacket, and
gloves took the letter away. It was photographed and X-rayed. The Israeli
embassy had already lost one man to a letter bomb, and it did not intend to
lose another.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally the letter was opened. It contained two
sheets of onionskin airmail paper covered in script. In Arabic. Rafi did not
speak Arabic, let alone read it. Neither did anyone else in the London station,
at least not well enough to read spidery Arabic handwriting. Rafi sent a
copious and heavily encrypted radio report to Tel Aviv, then wrote an even
fuller account in the formal and uniform style called NAKA in the Mossad. The
letter and the report went into the diplomatic bag and caught the evening
flight by El Al from Heathrow to Ben-Gurion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A dispatch rider with an armed escort met the
courier right off the plane and took the canvas bag destined for the big
building on King Saul Boulevard, where, just after the breakfast hour, it found
itself in front of the head of the Iraq Desk, a very able young <i>katsa</i>
called David Sharon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He <i>did</i> speak and read Arabic, and what
he read in those two onionskin pages of letter left him with the same sensation
he had felt the first time he threw himself out of an airplane over the Negev
Desert while training with the Paras.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Using his own typewriter, avoiding both
secretary and word processor, he typed out a literal translation of the letter
in Hebrew. Then he took them both, plus Rafi’s report as to how the Mossad had
come by the letter, to his immediate chief, the Director of the Middle East
Division.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What the letter said, in effect, was that the
writer was a high-ranking functionary in the topmost councils of<i> </i>the
Iraqi regime and that he was prepared to work for Israel for money—but only for
money.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a bit more, and a post-office-box
address at Baghdad’s principal post office for a reply, but that was the gist
of it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That evening, there was a high-level meeting in Kobi Dror’s
private office. Present were he and Sami Gershon, head of the Combatants. Also
Eitan Hadar, David Sharon’s immediate superior as Director of the Middle East
Division, to whom he had taken the Baghdad letter that morning. Sharon himself
was summoned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the outset, Gershon was dismissive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s a phony,” he said. “I’ve never seen such
a blatant, clumsy, obvious attempt at entrapment. Kobi, I’m not sending any of
my men in there to check it out. It would be sending the man to his death. I
wouldn’t even send an <i>oter</i> to Baghdad to try and make contact.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An <i>oter</i> is an Arab used by the Mossad to
establish preliminary contact with a fellow Arab, a low-level go-between and a
lot more expendable than a full-fledged Israeli <i>katsa</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gershon’s view seemed to prevail. The letter
was a madness, apparently an attempt to lure a senior <i>katsa</i> to Baghdad
for arrest, torture, public trial, and public execution. Finally, Dror turned
to David Sharon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, David, you have a tongue. What do you
think?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sharon nodded regretfully.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think Sami almost certainly has to be right.
Sending a good man in there would be crazy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eitan Hadar shot him a warning look. Between
divisions, there was the usual rivalry. No need to hand victory to Gershon’s
Combatants Division on a plate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ninety-nine percent of the chances say it has
to be a trap,” said Sharon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Only ninety-nine?” asked Dror teasingly. “And
the one percent, my young friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, just a foolish idea,” Sharon said. “It
just occurred to me, the one percent might say that out of the blue, we have a
new Penkovsky.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was dead silence. The word hung in the
air like an open challenge. Gershon expelled his breath in a long hiss. Kobi
Dror stared at his Iraq Desk chief. Sharon looked at his fingertips.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In espionage there are only four ways of recruiting an
agent for infiltration into the high councils of a target country.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first is far and away the most difficult:
to use one of your own nationals, one trained to an extraordinary degree to
pass for a national of the target country right in the heart of that target. It
is almost impossible, unless the infiltrator was born and raised in the target
country and can be eased back in, with a cover story to explain his absence.
Even then, he will have to wait years to rise to useful office with access to
secrets—a sleeper for up to ten years.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Yet once, Israel had been the master of this
technique. This was because, when Israel was young, Jews poured in who had been
raised all over the world. There were Jews who could pass as Moroccans,
Algerians, Libyans, Egyptians, Syrians, Iraqis, and Yemenis. This was apart
from all those coming in from Russia, Poland, Western Europe, and North and
South America.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The most successful of these had been Elie
Cohen, born and raised in Syria. He was slipped back into Damascus as a Syrian
who had been away for years and had now returned. With his new Syrian name,
Cohen became an intimate of high-ranking politicians, civil servants, and
generals who spoke freely to their endlessly generous host at his sumptuous
parties. Everything they said, including the entire Syrian battle plan, went
back to Tel Aviv just in time for the Six-Day War. Cohen was exposed, tortured,
and publicly hanged in Revolution Square in Damascus. Such infiltrations are
extremely dangerous and very rare.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But as the years passed, the original immigrant
Israelis became old; their sabra children did not study Arabic and could not
attempt what Elie Cohen had done. This was why, by 1990, the Mossad had far
less brilliant Arabists than one might imagine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But there was a second reason. Penetration of
Arab secrets is easier to accomplish in Europe or the United States. If an Arab
state is buying an American fighter, the details can more easily be stolen, and
at a lot less risk, in America. If an Arab high-up seems susceptible to an
approach, why not make it while he is visiting the fleshpots of Europe? That is
why, by 1990, the vast bulk of Mossad operations were conducted in low-risk
Europe and America rather than in the high-risk Arab states.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The king of all the infiltrators, however, was
Marcus Wolf, who for years had run the East German intelligence net. He had one
great advantage—an East German could pass for a West German.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During his time “Mischa” Wolf infiltrated
scores and scores of his agents into West Germany. One of them became the personal
private secretary of Chancellor Willy Brandt himself. Wolf’s speciality was the
prim, dowdy, little spinster secretary who rose to become indispensable to her
West German minister-employer—and who could copy every document that crossed
her desk for transmission back to East Berlin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second method of infiltration is to use a
national of the aggressor agency, posing as someone coming from a third nation.
The target country knows that the infiltrator is a foreigner but is persuaded
he is a friendly, sympathetic foreigner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Mossad again did this brilliantly with a
man called Ze’ev Gur Arieh. He was born Wolfgang Lotz in Mannheim, Germany, in
1921. Wolfgang was six feet tall, blond, blue-eyed, uncircumcised, and yet
Jewish. He came to Israel as a boy, was raised there, took his Hebrew name,
fought with the underground Haganah, and went on to become a major in the
Israeli Army. Then the Mossad took him in hand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was sent back to Germany for two years to
perfect his native German and “prosper” with Mossad money. Then, with a new
gentile German wife, he emigrated to Cairo and set up a riding school.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a great success. Egyptian staff officers
loved to relax with their horses, attended by the champagne-serving Wolfgang, a
good right-wing, anti-Semitic German in whom they could confide. And confide
they did. Everything they said went back to Tel Aviv. Lotz was eventually
caught, was lucky not to be hanged, and after the Six-Day War was exchanged for
Egyptian prisoners.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But an even more successful impostor was a
German of an earlier generation. Before the Second World War, Richard Sorge had
been a foreign correspondent in Tokyo, speaking Japanese and with high contacts
in Hideki Tojo’s government. That government approved of Hider and assumed
Sorge was a loyal Nazi—he certainly said he was.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It never occurred to Tokyo that Sorge was not a
German Nazi. In fact, he was a German Communist in the service of Moscow. For
years he laid the war plans of the Tojo regime open for Moscow to study. His
great coup was his last. In 1941, Hitler’s armies stood before Moscow. Stalin
needed to know urgently: Would Japan mount an invasion of the USSR from her
Manchurian bases? Sorge found out; the answer was no. Stalin could transfer
forty thousand Mongol troops from the east to Moscow. The Asiatic cannon fodder
held the Germans at bay for a few more weeks, until winter came and Moscow was
saved.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Not so Sorge; he was unmasked and hanged. But
before he died, his information probably changed history.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The most common method of securing an agent in
the target country is the third: simply to recruit a man who is already “in
place.” Recruitment can be tediously slow or surprisingly fast. To this end,
talent spotters patrol the diplomatic community looking for a senior
functionary of the other side who may appear disenchanted, resentful,
dissatisfied, bitter, or in any way susceptible to recruitment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Delegations visiting foreign parts are studied
to see if someone can be taken aside, given a fine old time, and approached for
a change of loyalty. When the talent spotter has tabbed a “possible,” the
recruiters move in, usually starting with a casual friendship that becomes
deeper and warmer. Eventually, the “friend” suggests his pal might do him a
small favor; a minor and inconsequential piece of information is needed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Once the trap is sprung, there is no going
back, and the more ruthless the regime the new recruit is serving, the less
likely he will confess all and throw himself on that regime’s nonexistent
mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The motives for being so recruited to serve
another country vary. The recruit may be in debt, in a bitter marriage, passed
over for promotion, revolted by his own regime, or simply lust for a new life
and plenty of money. He may be recruited through his own weaknesses, sexual or
homosexual, or simply by sweet talk and flattery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Quite a few Soviets, like Penkovsky and
Gordievsky, changed sides for genuine reasons of conscience, but most spies who
turn on their own country do so because they share a quite monstrous vanity, a
conviction that they are truly important in the scheme of things.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the weirdest of all the recruitments is
called the “walk-in.” As the phrase implies, the recruit simply walks in,
unexpected and unannounced, and offers his services.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The reaction of the agency so approached is
always one of extreme skepticism—surely this must be a “plant” by the other
side. Thus when, in 1960, a tall Russian approached the Americans in Moscow,
declared he was a full colonel of the Soviet military intelligence arm, the
GRU, and offered to spy for the West, he was rejected.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bewildered, the man approached the British, who
gave him a try. Oleg Penkovsky turned out to be one of the most amazing agents
ever. In his brief thirty-month career he turned over 5,500 documents to the
Anglo-American operation that ran him, and every one of them was in the secret
or top secret category. During the Cuban missile crisis, the world never
realized that President Kennedy knew the full hand of cards that Nikita
Khrushchev had to play, like a poker player with a mirror behind his opponent’s
back. The mirror was Penkovsky.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Russian took crazy risks, refusing to come
out to the West while he had the chance. After the missile crisis he was
unmasked by Soviet counterintelligence, tried, and shot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>None of the other three Israelis in Kobi Dror’s
room that night in Tel Aviv needed to be told anything about Oleg Penkovsky. In
their world, he was part of legend. The dream hovered in all their minds after
Sharon dropped the name. A real, live, gold-plated, twenty-four-carat traitor
in Baghdad? Could it be true—could it possibly be true?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kobi Dror gave Sharon a long, hard look.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What have you in mind, young man?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I was just thinking,” said Sharon with feigned
diffidence. “A letter ... no risks to anyone—just a letter ... asking a few
questions, difficult questions, things we would like to know. ... He comes up
or he doesn’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dror glanced at Gershon. The man who ran the
illegal agents shrugged. “I put men in on the ground,” the gesture seemed to
say. “What do I care about letters?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, young David. We write him a letter
back. We ask him some questions. Then we see. Eitan, you work with David on
this. Let me see the letter before it goes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eitan Hadar and David Sharon left together.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I hope you know what the hell you’re doing,”
the head of Middle East muttered to his protégé.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The letter was crafted with extreme care.
Several in-house experts worked on it—the Hebrew version at least. Translation
would come later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>David Sharon introduced himself by his first name
only, right at the start. He thanked the writer for his trouble and assured him
the letter had arrived safely at the destination the writer must have intended.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The reply went on to say that the writer could
not fail to understand that his letter had aroused great surprise and suspicion
both by its source and its method of transmission.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>David knew, he said, that the writer was
clearly no fool and therefore would realize that “my people” would need to
establish some bona fides.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>David went on to assure the writer that if his
bona fides could be established, his requirement for payment would present no
problem, but clearly the product would have to justify the financial rewards
that “my people” were prepared to pay. Would the writer therefore be kind
enough to seek to answer the questions on the attached sheet?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The full letter was longer and more
complicated, but that was the gist of it. Sharon ended by giving the writer a
mailing address in Rome for his reply.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The address was actually a discontinued safe house
that the Rome station had volunteered at Tel Aviv’s urgent request. From then
on, the Rome station would keep an eye on the abandoned address. If Iraqi
security agents showed up at it, they would be spotted and the affair aborted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The list of twenty questions was carefully
chosen and after much head-scratching. To eight of the questions Mossad already
knew the answers but would not be expected to know. So an attempt to fool Tel
Aviv would not work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eight more questions concerned developments
that could be checked for veracity after they had happened. Four questions were
things that Tel Aviv really wanted to know, particularly about the intentions
of Saddam Hussein himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let’s see how high this bastard really goes,”
said Kobi Dror when he read the list.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally a professor in Tel Aviv University’s
Arabic Faculty was called in to phrase the letter in that ornate and flowery style
of the written language. Sharon signed it in Arabic with the Arab version of
his own name, Daoud.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The text also contained one other point. David
would like to give his writer a name, and if the writer in Baghdad did not
object, would he mind being known simply as Jericho?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The letter was mailed from the only Arab
country where Israel had an embassy—Cairo.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After it had gone, David Sharon went on with
his work and waited. The more he thought it over, the crazier the affair seemed
to be. A post-office box, in a country where the counterintelligence net was
run by someone as smart as Hassan Rahmani, was horrendously dangerous. So was writing
top secret information “in clear,” and there was no indication that Jericho
knew anything about secret writing. Continuing to use the ordinary mail was
also out of the question, if this thing developed. However, he reasoned, it
probably would not.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But it did. Four weeks later, Jericho’s reply
reached Rome and was brought unopened in a blastproof box to Tel Aviv. Extreme
precautions were taken. The envelope might be wired to explosives or smeared
with a deadly toxin. When the scientists finally declared it clean, it was
opened.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To their stunned amazement, Jericho had come up
with paydirt. All the eight questions to which the Mossad already knew the
answers were completely accurate. Eight more—troop movements, promotions,
dismissals, foreign trips by identifiable luminaries of the regime—would have
to wait for check-out as and when they occurred, if they ever did. The last
four questions Tel Aviv could neither know nor check, but all were utterly
feasible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>David Sharon wrote a fast letter back, in a text
that would cause no security problems if intercepted: “Dear Uncle, many thanks
for your letter which has now arrived. It is wonderful to hear that you are
well and in good health. Some among the points you raise will take time, but
all being well, I will write again soon. Your loving nephew, Daoud.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The mood was growing in the Hadar Dafna
building that this man Jericho might be serious after all. If that was so,
urgent action was needed. An exchange of two letters was one thing; running a
deep-cover agent inside a brutal dictatorship was another. There was no way
that communication could continue on the basis of in-clear script, public
mails, and post-office boxes. They were a recipe for an early disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A case officer would be needed to get into
Baghdad, live there, and run Jericho using all the usual tradecraft—secret
writing, codes, dead-letter boxes, and a no-intercept means of getting the
product out of Baghdad and back to Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m not having it,” Gershon repeated. “I will
not put a senior Israeli <i>katsa</i> into Baghdad on a black mission for an
extended stay. It’s diplomatic cover, or he doesn’t go.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, Sami,” said Dror. “Diplomatic cover
it is. Let’s see what we’ve got.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The point of diplomatic cover is that a black
agent can be arrested, tortured, hanged—whatever. An accredited diplomat, even
in Baghdad, can avoid such unpleasantness; if caught spying, he will merely be
declared persona non grata and expelled. It is done all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Several major divisions of the Mossad went into
overdrive that summer, especially Research. Gershon could already tell them he
had no agent on the staff of any embassy accredited to Baghdad, and his nose
was already well out of<i> </i>joint because of it. So the search began to find
a diplomat who would suit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Every foreign embassy in Baghdad was
identified. From the capital cities of every country, a list was acquired of
all their staff in Baghdad. No one checked out; no one had ever worked for the
Mossad before, who could be reactivated. There was not even one <i>sayan</i> on
those lists.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then a clerk came up with an idea: the United
Nations. The world body had one agency based in Baghdad in 1988, the UN
Economic Commission for West Asia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Mossad has a big penetration of the United
Nations in New York, and a staff list was acquired. One name checked out: a
young Jewish Chilean diplomat called Alfonso Benz Moncada. He was not a trained
agent, but he <i>was</i> a <i>sayan</i> and therefore presumably was prepared

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One by one Jericho’s tips came true. The
checking process revealed that the Army divisions he had said would be moved were
mewed; the promotions he foretold duly happened, and the dismissals took place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Either Saddam himself is behind this farrago,
or Jericho is betraying his country from asshole to elbow,” was Kobi Dror’s
judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>David Sharon sent a third letter, also
innocently couched. For his second and third missives, the professor had not
been needed. The third letter referred to an order by the Baghdad-based client
for some very delicate glassware and porcelain. Clearly, said David, a little
more patience was needed so that a means of transshipment could be devised that
would guarantee the cargoes from accidental disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A Spanish-speaking <i>katsa</i> already based
in South America was sent pronto to Santiago and persuaded the parents of Señor
Benz to urge their son home immediately on compassionate leave because his
mother was seriously ill. It was the father who telephoned his son in Baghdad.
The worried son applied for and at once got three weeks’ compassionate leave
and flew back to Chile.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was met not by a sick mother but by an
entire team of Mossad training officers who begged him to accede to their
request. He discussed the matter with his parents and agreed. The emotional
pull of the needs of the Land of Israel, which none of them had ever seen, was
strong.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Another <i>sayan</i> in Santiago, without
knowing why, lent his summer villa, set in a walled garden outside the city
near the sea, and the training team went to work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It takes two years to train a <i>katsa</i> to
run a deep-cover agent in hostile terrain, and that is the minimum. The team
had three weeks. They worked sixteen-hour days. They taught the thirty-year-old
Chilean secret writing and basic codes, miniature photography and the reduction
of photographs to microdots. They took him out on the streets and taught him
how to spot a tail. They warned him never to shake a tail, except in an
absolute emergency, if carrying deeply incriminating material. They told him
that if he even thought he was being followed to abort the rendezvous or the
pickup and try again later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They showed him how to use combustible
chemicals stored in a false fountain pen to destroy incriminating evidence in
seconds while hiding in any men’s restroom or just around a corner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They took him out in cars to show him how to
spot a car tail, one acting as instructor and the rest of the team as the “hostiles.”
They taught him until his ears rang and his eyes ached and he begged for sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then they taught him about dead-letter boxes or
drops—secret compartments where a message may be left or another collected.
They showed him how to create one from a recess behind a loose brick in a wall,
or under a tombstone, in a crevice in an old tree, or beneath a flagstone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After three weeks, Alfonso Benz Moncada bade
good-bye to his tearful parents and flew back to Baghdad via London. The senior
instructor leaned back in his chair at the villa, passed an exhausted hand over
his forehead, and told the team:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If that bugger stays alive and free, I’ll make
the pilgrimage to Mecca.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The team laughed; their leader was a deeply
Orthodox Jew. All the time they were teaching Moncada, none of them had known
what he was going to do back in Baghdad. It was not their job to know. Neither
did the Chilean.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was during the stopover in London that he
was taken to the Heathrow Penta Hotel. There he met Sami Gershon and David
Sharon, and they told him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t try and identify him,” Gershon warned
the young man. “Leave that to us. Just establish the drops and service them. We’ll
send you the lists of things we want answered. You won’t understand them—they’ll
be in Arabic. We don’t think Jericho speaks much English, if at all. Don’t ever
try to translate what we send you. Just put it in one of the you-to-him drops
and make the appropriate chalk mark so he knows to go and service the drop.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When you see his chalk mark, go and service
the him-to-you box, and get his answer back.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In a separate bedroom Alfonso Benz Moncada was
given his new luggage. There was a camera that looked like a tourist’s Pentax
but took a snap-on cartridge with more than a hundred exposures in it, plus an
innocent-looking aluminum strut frame for holding the camera at exactly the
right distance above a sheet of paper. The camera was preset for that range.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His toilet kit included combustible chemicals
disguised as aftershave, and various invisible inks. The letter-writing wallet
held all the treated paper for secret writing. Last, they told him the means
for communicating with them, a method they had been setting up while he was
training in Chile.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He would write letters concerning his love of
chess—he already was a chess fan—to his pen pal Justin Bokomo of Uganda, who
worked in the General Secretariat of the UN building in New York. His letters
would <i>always </i>go out of Baghdad in the UN diplomatic mail pouch for New
York. The replies would also come from Bokomo in New York.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though Benz Moncada did not know it, there <i>was</i>
a Ugandan called Bokomo in New York. There was also a Mossad <i>katsa</i> in
the mail room to effect the intercepts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bokomo’s letters would have a reverse side
that, when treated, would reveal the Mossad’s question list. This was to be
photocopied when no one was looking and passed to Jericho in one of the agreed
drops. Jericho’s reply would probably be in spidery Arabic script. Each page
was to be photographed ten times, in case of smudging, and the film dispatched
to Bokomo.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Back in Baghdad the young Chilean, with his
heart in his mouth, established six drops, mainly behind loose bricks in old
walls or ruined houses, under flagstones in back alleys, and one under a stone
windowsill of a derelict shop.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Each time, he thought he would be surrounded by
the dreaded AMAM, but the citizens of Baghdad seemed as courteous as ever and
no one took any notice of him as he prowled, apparently a curious foreign
tourist, up and down the alleys and side streets of the Old Quarter, the
Armenian Quarter, the fruit and vegetable market at Kasra, and the old
cemeteries—anywhere he could find crumbling old walls and loose flagstones
where no one would ever think of looking.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He wrote down the locations of the six drops,
three to contain messages from him to Jericho and three for replies from
Jericho to him. He also devised six places—walls, gates, shutters—on three of
which an innocent chalk mark would alert Jericho that there was a message for
him, and three others where Jericho would signal he had a reply ready and
sitting in a dead-letter box awaiting collection.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Each chalk mark responded to a different drop.
He wrote down the locations of these drops and chalk-mark sites so precisely
that Jericho could find them on written description only.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All the time he watched for a tail, either
driving or on foot. Just once he was under surveillance, but it was clumsy and
routine, for the AMAM seemed to pick occasional days to follow occasional
diplomats. The following day there was no tail, so he resumed again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he had it all ready, he wrote it down
using a typewriter, after having memorized every detail. He destroyed the
ribbon, photographed the sheets, destroyed the paperwork, and sent the film to
Mr. Bokomo. Via the mail room of the UN building on the East River in New York,
the small package came back to David Sharon in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The risky part was getting all this information
to Jericho. It meant one last letter to that damnable post-office box in
Baghdad. Sharon wrote to his “friend” that the papers he needed would be
deposited at exactly noon in fourteen days, August 18, 1988, and should be
picked up no more than one hour later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The precise instructions, in Arabic, were with
Moncada by the sixteenth. At five to noon on the eighteenth, he entered the
post office, was directed to the post box, and dropped the bulky package in. No
one stopped or arrested him. An hour later, Jericho unlocked the box and
withdrew the package. He too was not stopped or arrested.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With secure contact now established, traffic
began to flow. Jericho insisted he would price each consignment of information
that Tel Aviv wanted, and if the money was deposited, the information would be
sent. He named a very discreet bank in Vienna, the Winkler Bank in the
Ballgasse, just off Franzis-kanerplatz, and gave an account number.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Tel Aviv agreed and immediately checked out the
bank. It was small, ultradiscreet, and virtually impregnable. It clearly contained
a numbered account that matched, because the first transfer of twenty thousand
dollars by Tel Aviv into it was not returned to the transferring bank with a
query.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Mossad suggested that Jericho might care to
identify himself “for his own protection, in case anything went wrong and his
friends to the west could help.” Jericho refused point-blank; he went further.
If any attempt was made to survey the drops or close in on him in any way, or
if ever the money was not forthcoming, he would shut off immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Mossad agreed, but tried other ways.
Psychoportraits were drawn, his handwriting studied, lists of Iraqi notables
drawn up and studied. All that the back-room boys could guess was that Jericho
was middle-aged, of medium education, probably spoke little or hesitant
English, and had a military or quasi-military background.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That gives me half the bloody Iraqi High
Command, the top fifty in the Ba’ath Party, and John Doe’s cousin Fred,”
growled Kobi Dror.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Alfonso Benz Moncada ran Jericho for two years,
and the product was pure gold. It concerned politics, conventional weapons,
military progress, changes of command, armaments procurement, rockets, gas,
germ warfare, and two attempted coups against Saddam Hussein. Only on Iraq’s
nuclear progress was Jericho hesitant. He was asked, of course. It was under
deep secrecy and known only to the Iraqi equivalent of Robert Oppenheimer, the
physicist Dr. Jaafar Al-Jaafar. To press too hard would be to invite exposure,
he reported.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the autumn of 1989 Jericho told Tel Aviv
that Gerry Bull was under suspicion and under surveillance in Brussels by a
team from the Iraqi Mukhabarat. The Mossad, who were by then using Bull as
another source for progress on Iraq’s rockets program, tried to warn him as
subtly as they could. There was no way they would tell him to his face what
they knew—it would be tantamount to telling him they had an asset high in
Baghdad, and no agency will ever blow away an asset like that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So the <i>katsa</i> controlling the substantial
Brussels station had his men penetrate Bull’s apartment on several occasions through
the autumn and winter, leaving oblique messages by rewinding a videotape,
changing wineglasses around, leaving a patio window open, even placing a long
strand of female hair on his pillow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The gun scientist became worried all right, but
not enough. When Jericho’s message concerning the intent to liquidate Bull came
through, it was too late. The hit had been carried out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Jericho’s information gave the Mossad an almost-complete
picture of Iraq in the buildup to the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. What he told
them about Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction confirmed and amplified the
pictorial evidence that had been passed over to them by Jonathan Pollard, by
then sentenced to life in prison.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bearing in mind what it knew and what it
assumed America must also know, the Mossad waited for America to react. But as
the chemical, nuclear, and bacteriological preparations in Iraq progressed, the
torpor in the West continued, so Tel Aviv stayed silent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two million dollars had passed from the Mossad
to the numbered account of Jericho In Vienna by August 1990. He was expensive,
but he was good, and Tel Aviv decided he was worth it. Then the invasion of
Kuwait took place, and the unforeseen happened. The United Nations, having
passed the resolution of August 2 calling on Iraq to withdraw at once, felt it
could not continue to support Saddam by maintaining a presence in Baghdad. On
August 7, the Economic Commission for West Asia was abruptly closed down, and
its diplomats recalled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Benz Moncada was able to do one last thing
before his departure. He left a message in a drop telling Jericho that he was
being expelled and contact was now broken. However, he might return, and
Jericho should continue to scan the places where the chalk marks were put. Then
he left. The young Chilean was extensively debriefed in London until there was
nothing left he could tell David Sharon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Thus Kobi Dror was able to lie to Chip Barber
with a straight face. At the time, he was <i>not</i> running an asset in Baghdad.
It would be too embarrassing to admit that he had never discovered the traitor’s
name and that now he had even lost contact. Still, as Sami Gershon had made
plain, if the Americans ever found out ... In hindsight, perhaps he really
should have mentioned Jericho.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942759">Chapter 8</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin visited the tomb of Able Seaman Shepton in the
cemetery of Sulaibikhat on the first of October and discovered the plea from
Ahmed Al-Khalifa.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was not particularly surprised. If Abu Fouad
had heard of him, he had also heard of the steadily growing and spreading
Kuwaiti resistance movement and its shadowy leading light. That they should
eventually have to meet was probably inevitable.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In six weeks, the position of the Iraqi occupation
forces had changed dramatically. In their invasion they had had a pushover, and
they had begun their occupation with a sloppy confidence, assured that their
stay in Kuwait would be as effortless as the conquest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The looting had been easy and profitable, the
destruction amusing, and the using of the womenfolk pleasurable. It had been
the way of conquerors that went back to the days of Babylon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kuwait, after all, had been a fat pigeon ready
for the plucking. But in six weeks, the pigeon had begun to peck and scratch.
Over a hundred Iraqi soldiers and eight officers had either disappeared or been
found dead. The disappearances could not all be explained by desertions. For
the first time, the occupation forces were experiencing fear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Officers no longer traveled in a single staff
car but insisted on a truckload of escorting troops. Headquarters buildings had
to be guarded night and day, to the point where Iraqi officers had taken to
firing over the heads of their sleeping sentries to wake them up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The nights had become periods of no-go for
anything less than a substantial troop movement. The roadblock teams huddled
inside their redoubts when darkness fell. And still the mines went off, the
vehicles burst into flame or seized up with ruined engines, the grenades were
thrown, and the soldiers disappeared with cut throats into sewers or garbage
dumps.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The escalating resistance had forced the High
Command to replace the Popular Army with the Special Forces, good fighting
troops who should have been at the front line in case the Americans came. Early
October for Kuwait was not, to echo Churchill’s phrase, the beginning of the
end, but it was the end of the beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had no means of replying to Al-Khalifa’s
message when he read it in the graveyard, so it was not until the following day
that he deposited his answer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He agreed to meet, he said, but on his own
terms. To have the advantage of darkness but to avoid the curfew at ten <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span>, he called for a meeting at half past
seven. He gave exact directions as to where Abu Fouad should park his car and
the small grove of trees where he would meet. The place he indicated was in the
district of Abrak Kheitan, close to the main highway from the city to the now
shattered and unused airport.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin knew it to be an area of traditional
stone-built houses with flat roofs. On one of those roofs he would be waiting
for two hours before the rendezvous to see if the Kuwaiti officer was being
followed and if so by whom: his own bodyguards, or the Iraqis. In a hostile
environment, the SAS officer was still at large and in combat because he took
no chances, none at all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He knew nothing of Abu Fouad’s concept of
security and was not prepared to assume it was brilliant. He established the
meeting for the evening of the seventh and left his reply beneath the marble
slab. Ahmed Al-Khalifa retrieved it on the fourth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dr. John Hipwell would never have been taken during a
casual meeting for a nuclear physicist, let alone one of those scientists who
spent his working days behind the massive security of the Atomic Weapons
Research Establishment at Aldermaston designing plutonium warheads for the
soon-to-be-fitted Trident missiles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A passing observer would have assumed he was a
bluff Home Counties farmer, more at home leaning wisely over a pen of fat lambs
at the local market than supervising the cladding of lethal disks of plutonium
in pure gold.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Although the weather was still mild when
Hipwell reappeared before the Medusa Committee, he wore, as in August, his
square-patterned shirt, wool tie, and tweed jacket. Without waiting to be
asked, he used his big red hands to fill and tamp a briar pipe with shag
tobacco before starting into his report. Sir Paul Spruce twitched his pointed
nose in distaste and gestured for the air conditioning to be raised a notch.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, gentlemen, the good news is that our
friend Mr. Saddam Hussein does not have, an atomic bomb at his disposal. Not
yet, not by a long chalk,” said Dr. Hipwell, as he disappeared into a cloud of
pale blue smoke.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a pause while he attended to his
personal bonfire. Perhaps, Terry Martin mused, if you risk collecting a lethal
dose of plutonium rays every day, the occasional pipe of tobacco does not
really matter. Dr. Hipwell glanced at his notes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Iraq has been on the trail of her own nuclear
bomb since the mid-1970s, when Saddam Hussein really came to power. It seems to
be the man’s obsession. In those years Iraq bought a complete nuclear reactor
system from France—which was not bound by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
of 1968—for that very purpose.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He sucked contentedly and tamped the glowing
brushfire at the top of his pipe once again. Drifting embers settled onto his
notes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Forgive me,” said Sir Paul. “Was this reactor
for the purpose of generating electricity?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Supposed to be,” agreed Hipwell. “Absolute
rubbish, of course, and the French knew it. Iraq has the third-largest oil
deposits in the world. They could have had an oil-fired power station for a
fraction of the price. No, the point was to fuel the reactor with low-grade
uranium, called yellowcake or caramel, that they could persuade people to sell
them. After use in a reactor, the end-product is plutonium.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were nods around the table. Everyone knew
that the British reactor at Sellafield created electricity for the power grid
and spewed out the plutonium that went to Hipwell for his warheads.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So the Israelis went to work,” said Hipwell. “First
one of their commando teams blew up the huge turbine at Toulon before it was
shipped, setting the project back two years. Then in 1981, when Saddam’s
precious Osirak 1 and 2 plants were about to start up, Israeli fighter-bombers
swept in and blew the lot to kingdom come. Since then, Saddam has never
succeeded in buying another reactor. After a short while, he stopped trying.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why the hell did he do that?” asked Harry
Sinclair from his end of the table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because he changed direction,” said Hipwell
with a broad smile, like one who has solved a crossword puzzle in record time. “Up
until then, he was pursuing the plutonium road. With some success, by the way.
But not enough. Yet—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t understand,” said Sir Paul Spruce. “What
is the difference between a plutonium-based and a uranium-based atomic bomb?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Uranium is simpler,” said the physicist. “Look,
there are various radioactive substances that can be used for a chain reaction,
but for your simple, basic, effective atom bomb, uranium’s the ticket. That’s
what Saddam has been after since 1982—a basic uranium-based bomb. He hasn’t got
there yet, but he’s still trying, and he’ll get there one day.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hipwell sat back with a broad beam, as if he
had settled the enigma of the Creation. Like most of those around the table,
Spruce was still perplexed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If he can buy this uranium for his destroyed
reactor, why can’t he make a bomb with it?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hipwell pounced upon the question like a farmer
on a bargain.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Different kinds of uranium, my dear man. Funny
stuff, uranium. Very rare. From a thousand tons of uranium ore, all you get is
a block the size of a cigar box. Yellowcake. It’s called natural uranium, with
an isotope number of 238. You can power an industrial reactor with it, but not
make a bomb. Not pure enough. For a bomb you need the lighter isotope, uranium-235.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where does that come from?” asked Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s inside the yellowcake. In that one
cigar-box-size block there is enough uranium-235 to stick under one fingernail
without discomfort. The devil is getting the two separated. It’s called isotope
separation. Very difficult, very technical, very expensive, and very slow.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But you said Iraq is getting there,” pointed
out Sinclair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He is, but he’s not there yet,” said Hipwell. “There’s
only one viable way of purifying and refining the yellowcake to the required
ninety-three percent pure. Years ago, in the Manhattan Project, your chaps
tried several methods. They were experimenting, see? Ernest Lawrence tried one
way, Robert Oppenheimer tried another. In those days they used both methods in
complementary fashion and created enough uranium-235 to make Little Boy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“After the war the centrifuge method was
invented and slowly perfected. Nowadays only this method is used. Basically,
you put the feedstock into a thing called a centrifuge, which spins so fast
that the whole process has to be done in a vacuum or the bearings would turn to
jelly. Slowly the heavier isotopes, the ones you don’t want, are drawn to the
outer wall of the centrifuge and bled off. What’s left is a little bit purer
than when you started. Just a little bit. You have to do it over and over
again, thousands of hours, just to get a wafer of bomb-grade uranium the size
of a postage stamp.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But he is doing it?” pressed Sir Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yep. Been doing it for about a year. These
centrifuges ... to save time we link them in series, called cascades. But you
need thousands of centrifuges to make up a cascade.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If they’ve been going down that road since
1982, why has it taken so long?” asked Terry Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You don’t go into the hardware store and buy a
uranium gas diffusion centrifuge off the shelf,” Hipwell pointed out. “They
tried at first but were turned down—the documents show that. Since 1985 they
have been buying the component parts to build their own on-site. They got about
five hundred tons of basic uranium yellowcake, half of it from Portugal. They
bought much of the centrifuge technology from West Germany—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I thought Germany had signed a whole range of
international agreements limiting the spread of nuclear bomb technology,”
protested Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe they have. I wouldn’t know about the
politics,” said the scientist. “But they got the bits and pieces from all over
the place. You need designer lathes, special ultrastrong maraging steel,
anticorrosion vessels, special valves, high-temperature furnaces called ‘skull’
furnaces because that’s what they look like, plus vacuum pumps and bellows—this
is serious technology we are talking about. Quite a bit, plus the know-how,
came from Germany.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let me get this straight,” said Sinclair. “Has
Saddam got any isotope separation centrifuges working yet?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, one cascade. It’s been functioning for
about a year. And another one is coming on stream soon.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do you know where all this stuff is?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The centrifuge assembly plant is at a place
called Taji—here.” The scientist passed a large aerial photo over to the
American and circled a series of industrial buildings.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The working cascade seems to be underground
somewhere not far from the old wrecked French reactor at Tuwaitha, the reactor
they called Osirak. I don’t know whether you’ll ever find it with a bomber—it’s
certainly underground and camouflaged.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the new cascade?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No idea,” said Hipwell. “Could be anywhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Probably somewhere else,” suggested Terry
Martin. “The Iraqis have been practicing duplication and dispersal ever since they
put all their eggs in one basket and the Israelis blew the basket away.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sinclair grunted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How sure are you,” asked Sir Paul, “that
Saddam Hussein cannot have his bomb yet?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very,” said the physicist. “It’s a question of
time. He hasn’t had long enough. For a basic but usable atomic bomb, he will
need thirty to thirty-five kilograms of pure uranium-235. Starting cold a year
ago, even assuming the working cascade can function twenty-four hours a day—which
it can’t—a spinning program needs at least twelve hours per centrifuge. You
need a thousand spins to get from zero percent pure to the required
ninety-three percent. That’s five hundred days of spinning. But then there’s
cleaning, servicing, maintenance, breakdowns. Even with a thousand centrifuges
operating in a cascade now and for the past year, you’d need five years. Bring
in another cascade next year—shorten it to three years.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So he won’t have his thirty-five kilograms
until 1993 at the earliest?” interjected Sinclair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, he can’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“One final question: If he gets the uranium,
how much longer to an atomic bomb?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not long. A few weeks. You see, a country
undertaking to make its own bomb will have the nuclear engineering side running
in parallel. Bomb engineering is not all that complicated, so long as you know
what you are doing. And Jaafar does—he will know how to build one and trigger
it. Dammit, we trained him at Harwell. But the point is, on a time-scale alone,
Saddam Hussein cannot have enough pure uranium ready yet. Ten kilograms, tops.
He’s three years short, minimum.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dr. Hipwell was thanked for his weeks of
analysis, and the meeting ended.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sinclair would return to his embassy and write
up his copious notes, which would go to the United States in heavy code. There
they would be compared with the analyses of the American counterparts—physicists
drawn from the laboratories of Sandia, Los Alamos, and principally Lawrence
Livermore in California, where for years a secret section called simply
Department Z had been monitoring the steady spread of nuclear technology around
the world on behalf of the State Department and the Pentagon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though Sinclair could not know it, the findings
of the British and American teams would confirm each other to a remarkable
degree.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin and Simon Paxman left the same
meeting and wandered across Whitehall in the benign October sunshine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Quite a relief,” said Paxman. “Old Hipwell was
quite adamant. Apparently the Americans agree entirely. That bastard is nowhere
near his atom bomb yet. One less nightmare to worry about.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They parted at the corner, Paxman to cross the
Thames toward Century House, Martin to cross Trafalgar Square and head up St.
Martin’s Lane toward Gower Street.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Establishing what Iraq had, or even probably
had, was one thing. Finding out precisely where it was situated was another.
The photography went on and on. The KH-11s and KH-12s drifted across the
heavens in endless sequence, photographing what they saw on the Iraqi land
beneath them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By October, another device had entered the
skies, a new American reconnaissance plane so secret that Capitol Hill did not
know about it. Code-named Aurora, it flew on the fringes of inner space,
reaching speeds of Mach 8, almost five thousand miles per hour, riding its own
fireball—the ramjet effect—far beyond Iraqi radar or interceptor missiles. Not
even the technology of the dying USSR could spot Aurora, which had replaced the
legendary SR-71 Blackbird.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ironically, while the Blackbird was being eased
out of commission, another even more aged “old faithful” was plying its trade
above Iraq that autumn. Almost forty years old, nicknamed the Dragon Lady, the
U-2 was still flying and still taking pictures. It was back in 1960 that Gary
Powers was shot down in a U-2 over Sverdlovsk, Siberia, and it was the U-2 that
had spotted the first Soviet missiles being deployed in Cuba in the summer of
1962, even though it was Oleg Penkovsky who had identified them as offensive
and not defensive weapons, thus blowing away Khrushchev’s phony protests and
sowing the seeds of his own eventual destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The U-2 of 1990 had been reequipped as a “listener”
rather than a “watcher” and redesignated TR-1, though it still did photography.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All this information, from the professors and
scientists, analysts and interpreters, the trackers and the watchers, the
interviewers and researchers, built up a picture of Iraq through the autumn of
1990, and a frightening picture it became.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From a thousand sources the information finally
was channeled into a single and very secret room two floors below the Saudi Air
Force headquarters on Old Airport Road. The room, down the street from where
the military brass sat in conference and discussed their unauthorized (by the
United Nations) plans for the invasion of Iraq, was called simply “the Black
Hole.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was in the Black Hole that American and British
targeters, drawn from all three services and of all ranks from private to
general, pinpointed the sites that would have to be destroyed. Finally, they
would make up General Chuck Horner’s air-war map. It contained eventually seven
hundred targets. Six hundred were military—in the sense of being command
centers, bridges, airfields, arsenals, ammunition dumps, missile sites, and
troop concentrations. The other hundred were targets concerned with weapons of
mass destruction—research facilities, assembly plants, chemical labs, storage
depots.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The gas centrifuge manufacturing line at Taji
was listed, as was the approximate, assumed, position of the centrifuge cascade
underground somewhere in the Tuwaitha complex.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the water-bottling plant at Tarmiya was not
there, nor was Al Qubai. No one knew about them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A copy of the comprehensive report by Harry
Sinclair in London joined other reports emanating from various parts of the
United States and abroad. Finally, a synthesis of all these in-depth analyses
found its way to a very small and very discreet State Department think tank,
known only to a restricted group in Washington as the Political Intelligence
and Analysis Group. The PIAG is a sort of analytical hothouse for foreign affairs
and produces reports that are absolutely not for public consumption. Indeed,
the unit answers only to the Secretary of State, at that time James Baker.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Two days later, Mike Martin lay flat on a roof that gave
him a commanding view of the section of Abrak Kheitan where he had set up his
rendezvous with Abu Fouad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At almost exactly the appointed hour, he
watched a single car leave the King Faisal Highway leading to the airport and
pull into a side street. The car cruised slowly down the street, away from the
bright lights of the highway and the occasional traffic, and into darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He saw the outline stop at the place he had
described in his message to Al-Khalifa. Two people got out, a man and a woman.
They looked around, checked that no other car had followed them off the highway,
and slowly walked on, toward the place where a grove of trees covered a vacant
lot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abu Fouad and the woman had been told to wait
up to half an hour. If the Bedou had not shown up, they were to abort and go
home. They actually waited forty minutes before returning to the car. Both were
frustrated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He must have been detained,” said Abu Fouad to
his companion. “An Iraqi patrol, perhaps. Who knows? Anyway, damn. I’ll have to
start again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think you’re crazy to trust him,” said the
woman. “You have no idea who he is.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They spoke softly, the Kuwaiti resistance
leader looking up and down the street to ensure no Iraqi soldiers had appeared
while he was away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s successful and cunning, and he works like
a professional. That’s all I need to know. I would like to collaborate with
him, if he’s willing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then I have nothing against that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The woman uttered a short scream. Abu Fouad
jerked in his seat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t turn round. Let’s just talk,” said the
voice from the back seat. In his rearview mirror the Kuwaiti saw the dim outline
of a Bedouin <i>keffiyeh</i> and caught the odor of one who lives rough. He let
out his breath in a long exhalation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You move quietly, Bedou.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No need to make a noise, Abu Fouad. It
attracts Iraqis. I don’t like that, except when I am ready.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abu Fouad’s teeth flashed under his black
moustache.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well. Now we have found each other. Let
us talk. By the way, why hide in the car?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If this meeting had been a trap for me, your
first words when you got back into the car would have been different.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Self-incriminating—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And then?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You would be dead.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Understood.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Who is your companion? I made no mention of
companions.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You set up the rendezvous. It was I who had to
trust you also. She is a trusted colleague. Asrar Qabandi.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well. Greetings, Miss Qabandi. What do
you want to talk about?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Guns, Bedou. Kalashnikov machine pistols,
modern hand grenades, Semtex-H. My people could do so much more with that sort
of thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Your people are being caught, Abu Fouad. Ten
were surrounded in the same house by an entire company of Iraqi infantry under
AMAM leadership. All shot. All youngsters.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abu Fouad was silent. It had been a major
disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nine,” he said at last. “The tenth played dead
and crept away later. He is injured, and we are taking care of him. It was he
who told us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That they were betrayed. If he had died, we
would not have known.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah, betrayal. Always the danger in any
resistance movement. And the traitor?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We know him, of course. We thought we could
trust him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But he is guilty?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It seems so.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Only seems?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abu Fouad sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The survivor swears that only the eleventh man
knew of the meeting, and the address. But it could be there was a leak
somewhere else, or one of them was tailed. ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then he must be tested, this suspect. And if
guilty, punished. Miss Qabandi, would you leave us for a while, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young woman glanced at Abu Fouad, who
nodded. She left the car and walked back to the grove of trees. The Bedou told
Abu Fouad carefully and in detail what he wanted him to do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I will not be leaving the house until seven o’clock,”
he finished. “So under no circumstances must you make the phone call until half
past seven. Understood?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Bedou slipped out of the car and
disappeared among the dark alleys running between the houses. Abu Fouad drove
up the street and picked up Miss Qabandi. Together they drove home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Bedou never saw the woman again. Before the
liberation of Kuwait, Asrar Qabandi was caught by the AMAM, rigorously
tortured, gang-raped, shot, and decapitated. Before she died, she never said a
thing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Terry Martin was on the phone to Simon Paxman, who was
still inundated with work and could have done without the interruption. It was
only because he had taken a liking to the fussy professor of Arabic studies
that Paxman took the call.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know I’m being a bother, but do you have any
contacts at GCHQ?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, of course,” said Paxman. “In the Arabic
Service, mainly. Know the Director of it, come to that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Could you possibly give him a call and ask if
he’d see me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, yes, I suppose so. What have you in
mind?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s the stuff coming out of Iraq these days.
I’ve studied all Saddam’s speeches, of course, and watched the announcements
about hostages and human shields and seen their ghastly attempts at PR on the
television. But I’d like to see if there’s anything else being picked up, stuff
that hasn’t been cleared by their Propaganda Ministry.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, that’s what GCHQ does,” admitted Paxman.
“I don’t see why not. If you’ve been sitting in with the Medusa people, you’ve
got the clearance. I’ll give him a call.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That afternoon, by appointment, Terry Martin
drove west to Gloucestershire and presented himself at the well-guarded gate of
the sprawl of buildings and antennae that constitute the third main arm of
British intelligence alongside MI-6 and MI-5, the Government Communications
Headquarters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Director of the Arabic Service was Sean
Plummer, under whom worked that same Mr. Al-Khouri who had tested Mike Martin’s
Arabic in the Chelsea restaurant eleven weeks earlier, though neither Terry
Martin nor Plummer knew that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Director had agreed to see Martin in the
midst of a busy day because, as a fellow Arabist, he had heard of the young
scholar of the SOAS and admired his original research on the Abassid Caliphate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now, what can I do for you?” he asked when
they were both seated with a glass of mint tea, a luxury Plummer permitted
himself to escape the miseries of institution coffee. Martin explained that he
was surprised at the paucity of the intercepts he had been shown corning out of
Iraq. Plummer’s eyes lit up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re right, of course. As you know, our Arab
friends lend to chatter like magpies on open circuits. The last couple of
years, the interceptable traffic has slumped. Now, either the whole national
character has changed, or—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Buried cables,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Precisely. Apparently Saddam and his boys have
buried over forty-five thousand miles of fiber-optic communication cables. That’s
what they’re talking on. For me, it’s an absolute bastard. How can I keep
giving the spooks in London another round of Baghdad weather reports and Mother
Hussein’s bloody laundry lists?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was his manner of speaking, Martin realized.
Plummer’s service delivered a lot more than that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They still talk of course—ministers, civil
servants, generals—right down to chitchat between tank commanders on the Saudi
border. But the serious, top-secret phone calls are off the air. Never used to
be. What do you want to see?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For the next four hours, Terry Martin ran his
eye over a range of intercepts. Radio broadcasts were too obvious; he was
looking for something in an inadvertent phone call, a slip of the tongue, a
mistake. Finally he closed the files of digests.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Would you,” he asked, “just keep an eye open
for anything really odd, anything that just doesn’t make sense?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin was beginning to think he should one day write
a tourist’s guide to the flat roofs of Kuwait City. He seemed to have spent an
impressive amount of time lying on one of them surveying the area beneath him.
On the other hand, they did make superb places for LUPs, or lying-up positions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had been on this particular one for almost
two days, surveying the house whose address he had given to Abu Fouad. It was
one of the six he had been lent by Ahmed Al-Khalifa, and one he would now never
use again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Although it was two days since he had given the
address to Abu Fouad and nothing was supposed to happen until tonight, October
9, he had still watched, night and day, living off a handful of bread and
fruit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If Iraqi soldiers arrived before seven-thirty
on the evening of the ninth, he would know who had betrayed him—Abu Fouad
himself. He glanced at his watch. Seven-thirty. The Kuwaiti colonel should be
making his call about now, as instructed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Across the city, Abu Fouad was indeed lifting
the phone. He dialed a number, which was answered on the third ring.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Salah?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, who is this?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have never met, but I have heard many good
things about you—that you are loyal and brave, one of us. People know me as Abu
Fouad.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a gasp at the end of the phone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I need your help, Salah. Can we, the movement,
count on you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, yes, Abu Fouad. Please tell me what it is
you want.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not I personally, but a friend. He is wounded
and sick. I know you are a pharmacist. You must at once take medications to him—bandages,
antibiotics, pain-killers. Have you heard of the one they call the Bedou?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, of course. But do you mean to say you
know him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Never mind, but we have been working together
for weeks. He is hugely important to us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I will go downstairs to the shop right now and
select the things he needs, and take them to him. Where do I find him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He is holed up in a house in Shuwaikh and
cannot move. Take pencil and paper.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abu Fouad dictated the address he had been
given. At the other end of the phone it was noted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I will drive over at once, Abu Fouad. You can
trust me,” said Salah the pharmacist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are a good man. You will be rewarded.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abu Fouad hung up. The Bedou had said he would
phone at dawn if nothing happened, and the pharmacist would be in the clear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin saw, rather than heard, the first
truck just before half past eight. It was rolling on its own momentum, the
engine off to make no sound, and it trundled past the intersection of the
street before coming to a halt a few yards farther on and just out of sight.
Martin nodded in approval.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second truck did the same a few moments
later. From each vehicle, twenty men descended quietly, Green Berets who knew
what they were doing. The men moved in a column up the street, headed by an
officer who grasped a civilian. The man’s white <i>dish-dash</i> glimmered in
the half-darkness. With all the street names ripped down, the soldiers had
needed a civilian guide to find this road. But the house numbers were still up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The civilian stopped at a house, studied the
number plate, and pointed. The captain in charge had a hurried, whispered
conversation with his sergeant, who took fifteen men down a side alley to cover
the back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Followed by the remaining soldiers, the captain
tried the steel door to the small garden. It opened. The men surged through.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside the garden the captain could see that a
low light burned in an upstairs room. Much of the ground floor was taken up by
the garage, which was empty. At the front door all pretense of stealth
vanished. The captain tried the handle, found it was locked, and gestured to a
soldier behind him. The man fired a brief burst from his automatic rifle at the
lock in the wooden setting, and the door swung open.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With the captain leading, the Green Berets
rushed in. Some went for the darkened ground-floor rooms; the captain and the
rest went straight up for the master bedroom.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the landing the captain could see the
interior of the low-lit bedroom, the armchair with its back to the door, and
the checkered <i>keffiyeh</i> peeping out over the top. He did not fire.
Colonel Sabaawi of the AMAM had been specific: This one he wanted alive for
questioning. As he rushed forward, the young officer did not feel the snag of
the nylon fishing line against his shins.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He heard his own men bursting in through the
back and others pounding up the stairs. He saw the slumped form in the soiled
white robe, filled out by cushions, and the big watermelon wrapped in the <i>keffiyeh</i>.
His face contorted with anger, and he had the time to snarl an insult at the
trembling pharmacist who stood in the doorway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Five pounds of Semtex-H may not sound like
much, and it does not look very large. The houses of that neighborhood are
built of stone and concrete, which was what saved the surrounding residences,
some of which were occupied by Kuwaitis, from more than superficial damage. But
the house in which the soldiers stood virtually disappeared. Tiles from its
roof were later found several hundred yards away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Bedou had not waited around to watch his
handiwork. He was already two streets away, shuffling along, minding his own
business, when he heard the muffled boom, like a door being slammed, then the
one-second hollow silence, then the crash of masonry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Three things happened the following day, all
after dark. In Kuwait, the Bedou had his second meeting with Abu Fouad. This
time, the Kuwaiti came alone to the rendezvous, in the shadow of a deep arched
doorway only two hundred yards from the Sheraton, which had been taken over by
dozens of senior Iraqi officers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You heard, Abu Fouad?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course. The whole city is buzzing. They
lost over twenty men and the rest injured.” He sighed. “There will be more
random reprisals.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You wish to stop now?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. We cannot. But how much longer must we
suffer?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Americans and the British will come. One
day.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Allah make it soon. Was Salah with them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He brought them. There was only one civilian.
You told no one else?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, just him. It must have been him. He has
the lives of nine young men on his head. He will not see Paradise.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So. What more do you want of me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I do not ask who you are or where you come
from. As a trained Army officer, I know you cannot be just a simple Bedou
camel-drover from the desert. You have supplies of explosives, guns,
ammunition, grenades. My people could also do much with these things.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And your offer?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Join with us and bring your supplies. Or stay
on your own but share your supplies. I am not here to threaten, only to ask.
But if you want to help our resistance, this is the way to do it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin thought for a while. After eight
weeks he had half his supplies left, still buried in the desert or scattered
through the two villas he used not for living but for storage. Of his other
four houses, one was destroyed and the other, where he had met with his pupils,
compromised. He could hand over his stores and ask for more by night drop—risky
but feasible, so long as his messages to Riyadh were not being intercepted,
which he could not know. Or he could make another camel trip across the border
and return with two more panniers. Even that would not be easy—there were now
sixteen divisions of Iraqis ranged along that border, three times the number
when he had entered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was time to contact Riyadh again and ask for
instructions. In the meanwhile, he would give Abu Fouad almost everything he
had. There was more south of the border; he would just have to get it through
somehow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where do you want it delivered?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have a warehouse in Shuwaikh Port. It is
quite secure. It stores fish. The owner is one of us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In six days,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They agreed on the time and the place where a
trusted aide of Abu Fouad would meet the Bedou and guide him the rest of the
journey to the warehouse. Martin described the vehicle he would be driving and
the way he would look.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That same night, but two hours earlier because of the time
difference, Terry Martin sat in a quiet restaurant not far from his apartment
and twirled a glass of wine in one hand. The guest he awaited entered a few
minutes later, an elderly man with gray hair, glasses, and a spotted bow tie.
He looked round inquiringly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Moshe, over here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Israeli bustled over to where Terry Martin
had risen, and greeted him effusively.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Terry, my dear boy, how are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Better for seeing you, Moshe. Couldn’t let you
pass through London without at least a dinner and a chance to chat.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Israeli was old enough to be Martin’s
father, but their friendship was based on common interest. Both were academics
and avid students of ancient Middle Eastern Arab civilizations, their cultures,
art, and languages.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Professor Moshe Hadari went back a long way. As
a young man, he had excavated much of the Holy Land with Yigael Yadin, himself
both a professor and an Army general. Hadari’s great regret was that, as an
Israeli, much of the Middle East was forbidden to him, even for scholarship.
Still, in his field he was one of the best, and that field being a small one,
it was inevitable that the two scholars should meet at some seminar, as they
had ten years earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a good dinner, and the talk flowed over
the latest research, the newest tiny fresh perceptions of the way life had been
in the kingdoms of the Middle East ten centuries earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin knew he was bound by the Official
Secrets Act, so his recent activities on assignment for Century House were not
for discussion. But over coffee their conversation came quite naturally around
to the crisis in the Gulf and the chances of a war.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do you think he will pull out of Kuwait, Terry?”
the professor asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin shook his head. “No, he can’t, unless he
is given a clearly marked road, concessions he can use to justify withdrawal.
To go naked, he falls.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hadari sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So much waste,” he said. “All my life, so much
waste. All that money, enough to make the Middle East a paradise on earth. All
that talent, all those young lives. And for what? Terry, if war comes, will the
British fight with the Americans?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course. We’ve already sent the Seventh
Armoured Brigade, and I believe the Fourth Armoured will follow. That makes a
division, apart from the fighters and the warships. Don’t worry about it. This
is one Mid-East war in which Israel not only may, but must, sit on her thumbs.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, I know,” said the Israeli gloomily. “But
many more young men will have to die.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin leaned forward and patted his friend on
the arm.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, Moshe, the man has got to be stopped.
Sooner or later. Israel of all countries must know how far he has got with his
weapons of mass destruction. In a sense, we have just been finding out the true
scale of what he has.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But our people have been helping, of course.
We are probably his principal target.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, in target analysis,” said Martin. “Our
principal problem is in hard, on-the-spot intelligence. We simply don’t have
top-level intelligence coming to us out of Baghdad. Not the British, not the
Americans, and not even your people either.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Twenty minutes later the dinner ended, and
Terry Martin saw Professor Hadari into a taxi to take him back to his hotel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>About the hour of midnight, three triangulation stations
were implanted in Kuwait on the orders of Hassan Rahmani in Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were radio dishes designed to track the
source of a radio-wave emission and take a compass bearing on it. One was a
fixed station, mounted on the roof of a tall building in the district of
Ardiya, on the extreme southern outskirts of Kuwait City. Its dish faced toward
the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other two were mobile stations, large vans
with the dishes on the roof, an in-built generator for the electrical power,
and a darkened interior where the scanners could sit at their consoles and
trawl the airwaves for the transmitter they sought, which they had been told
would probably send from somewhere out in the desert between the city and the
Saudi border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of these vans was outside Jahra, well to
the west of its colleague in Ardiya, and the third was down the coast, in the
grounds of the Al Adan hospital, where the law student’s sister had been raped
in the first days of the invasions. The Al Adan tracker could get a full
cross-bearing on those reported by the scanners farther north, pinning the
source of the transmission down to a square a few hundred yards across.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At Ahmadi air base, where once Khaled
Al-Khalifa had flown his Skyhawk, a Soviet-built Hind helicopter gunship waited
on twenty-four-hour standby. The crew of the Hind was from the Air Force, a
concession Rahmani had had to squeeze out of the general commanding it. The
radio-tracking crews were from Rahmani’s own Counterintelligence wing, drafted
in from Baghdad and the best he had.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Professor Hadari spent a sleepless night. Something his
friend had told him worried him deeply. He regarded himself as a completely
loyal Israeli, born of an old Sephardic family who had emigrated just after the
turn of the century along with men like Ben-Yehuda and Ben-Gurion. He himself
had been born outside Jaffa, when it was still a bustling port of Palestinian
Arabs, and he had learned Arabic as a small boy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had raised two sons and seen one of them die
in a miserable ambush in South Lebanon. He was grandfather to five small
children. Who should tell him that he did not love his country?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But there was something wrong. If war came,
many young men might die, as his Ze’ev had died, even if they were British and
Americans and French. Was this the time for Kobi Dror to show vindictive,
small-power chauvinism?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He rose early, settled his bill, packed, and
ordered a taxi for the airport. Before he left the hotel, he hovered for a
while by the bank of phones in the lobby, then changed his mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Halfway to the airport, he ordered his cab
driver to divert off the M4 and find a phone booth. Grumbling at the time and
trouble this would take, the driver did so, eventually finding one on a corner
in Chiswick. Hadari was in luck. It was Hilary who answered the phone at the
Bayswater flat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hold on,” he said, “he’s halfway out the door.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin came on the line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s Moshe. Terry, I don’t have much time.
Tell your people the Institute <i>does </i>have a high source inside Baghdad.
Tell them to ask what happened to Jericho. Good-bye, my friend.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Moshe, one moment. Are you sure? How do you
know?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It doesn’t matter. You never heard this from
me. Goodbye.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The phone went dead. In Chiswick the elderly
scholar climbed back into his taxi and proceeded to Heathrow. He was trembling
at the enormity of what he had done. And how could he tell Terry Martin that it
was he, the professor of Arabic from Tel Aviv University, who had crafted that
first reply to Jericho in Baghdad?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Terry Martin’s call found Simon Paxman at his desk at
Century House just after ten.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Lunch? Sorry, I can’t. Hell of a day. Tomorrow
perhaps,” said Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Too late. It’s urgent, Simon.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman sighed. No doubt his tame academic had
come up with some fresh interpretation of a phrase in an Iraqi broadcast that
was supposed to change the meaning of life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Still can’t make lunch. Major conference here,
in-house. Look, a quick drink. The Hole-in-the-Wall, it’s a pub underneath
Waterloo Bridge, quite close to here. Say twelve o’clock? I can give you half
an hour, Terry.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“More than enough. See you,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just after noon, they sat over beers in the
alehouse above which the trains of the Southern Region rumbled to Kent, Sussex,
and Hampshire. Martin, without revealing his source, narrated what he had been
told that morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody hell,” whispered Paxman. There were
people in the next booth. “Who told you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can’t say.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, you must.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, he went out on a limb. I gave my word.
He’s an academic and senior. That’s all.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman thought. Academic, and mixing with Terry
Martin. Certainly another Arabist. Could have been on assignment with the
Mossad. Whatever, the information had to go back to Century and without delay.
He thanked Martin, left his beer, and scuttled back down the road to Century.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because of the lunchtime conference, Steve
Laing had not left the building. Paxman drew him aside and told him. Laing took
it straight to the Chief himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sir Colin, who was never given to
overstatement, pronounced General Kobi Dror to be a most tiresome fellow,
forsook his lunch, ordered something to be brought to his desk, and retired to
the top floor. There he put in a personal call on an extremely secure line to
Judge William Webster, Director of the CIA.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was only half past eight in Washington, but
the Judge was a man who liked to rise with the dawn, and he was at his desk to
take the call. He asked his British colleague a couple of questions about the
source of the information, grunted at the lack of one, but agreed it was
something that could not be let slide.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Webster told his Deputy Director (Operations)
Bill Stewart, who exploded with rage, and then had a half-hour conference with
Chip Barber, head of Operations for the Middle East Division. Barber was even
angrier, for he was the man who had sat facing General Dror in the bright room
on the top of a hill outside Herzlia and had, apparently, been told a lie.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Between them, they worked out what they wanted
done, and took the idea back to the Director.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In midafternoon William Webster had a
conference with Brent Scowcroft, Chairman of the National Security Council, and
he took the matter to President Bush. Webster had asked for what he wanted and
was given full authority to go ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The cooperation of Secretary of State James
Baker was sought, and he gave it immediately. That night, the State Department
sent an urgent request to Tel Aviv, which was presented to its recipient the
following morning, only three hours away due to the time gap.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel at that
time was Benjamin Netanyahu, a handsome, elegant, silver-haired diplomat and
the brother of that Jonathan Netanyahu who was the only Israeli killed during
the raid on Idi Amin’s Entebbe airport, in which Israeli commandos rescued the
passengers of a French airliner hijacked by Palestinian and German terrorists.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Benjamin Netanyahu had been born a
third-generation sabra and partly educated in the United States. Because of his
fluency and articulateness and his passionate nationalism, he was a member of
Itzhak Shamir’s Likud government and often Israel’s persuasive spokesman in
interviews with the Western media.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He arrived at Washington Dulles two days later,
on October 14, somewhat perplexed by the urgency of the State Department’s invitation
that he fly to the United States for discussions of considerable importance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was even more perplexed when two hours of
private talks with Deputy Secretary Lawrence Eagleburger revealed no more than
a comprehensive overview of developments in the Middle East since August 2. He
finished the talks thoroughly frustrated, then faced a late-night plane back to
Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was as he was leaving the State Department
that an aide slipped an expensive vellum card into his hand. The card was headed
with a personal crest, and the writer, in elegant cursive script, asked him not
to leave Washington without coining to the writer’s house for a short visit, to
discuss a matter of some urgency “to both our countries and all our people.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He knew the signature, knew the man, and knew
the power and wealth of the hand that wrote it. The writer’s limousine was at
the door. The Israeli minister made a decision and ordered his secretary to
return to the embassy for both sets of luggage and to rendezvous with him at a
house in Georgetown two hours later. From there they would proceed to Dulles.
Then he entered the limousine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had never been to the house before, but it
was as he would have expected, a handsome building at the better end of M
Street, not three hundred yards from the campus of Georgetown University. He
was shown into a paneled library with pictures and books of superlative rarity
and taste. A few moments later his host entered, advancing over the Kashan rug
with hand outstretched.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“My dear Bibi, how kind of you to spare the
time.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saul Nathanson was both banker and financier,
professions that had made him extremely wealthy, but his true fortune was
hinted at rather than declared, and the man himself was far too cultivated to
dwell upon it. The Van Dykes and Breughels on his walls were not copies, and
his donations to charity, including some in the State of Israel, were
legendary.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Like the Israeli minister, he was elegant and
gray-haired, but unlike the slightly younger man, he was tailored by Savile
Row, London, and his silk shirts were from Sulka.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He showed his guest to one of a pair of leather
club chairs before the log fire, and an English butler entered with a bottle
and two wineglasses on a silver tray.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Something I thought you might enjoy, my
friend, while we chat.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The butler poured two Lalique glasses of the
red wine, and the Israeli sipped. Nathanson raised an inquiring eyebrow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Superb, of course,” said Netanyahu. Château
Mouton Rothschild ’61 is not easy to come by and not to be gulped. The butler
left the bottle within reach and withdrew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saul Nathanson was far too subtle to barge into
the meat of what he wanted to say. Conversational hors d’oeuvres were served
first. Then the Middle East.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s going to be a war, you know,” he said
sadly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I have no doubt about it,” agreed Netanyahu.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Before it is over many young Americans may
well be dead, fine young men who do not deserve to die. We must all do what we
can to keep that number as low as humanly possible, wouldn’t you say? More
wine?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I could not agree more.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What on earth was the man driving at? Israel’s
Deputy Foreign Minister genuinely had no idea.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Saddam,” said Nathanson, staring at the fire, “is
a menace. He must be stopped. He is probably more of a menace to Israel than to
any other neighboring state.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have been saying that for years. But when
we bombed his nuclear reactor, America condemned us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nathanson made a dismissive gesture with one
hand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nonsense, of course, all cosmetic nonsense for
the face of things. We both know that, and we both know better. I have a son
serving in the Gulf.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I didn’t know. May he return safely.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nathanson was genuinely touched.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you, Bibi, thank you. I pray so every
day. My firstborn, my only son. I just feel that ... at this point in time ...
cooperation between us all must be without stint.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Unarguable.” The Israeli had the uncomfortable
feeling that bad news was coming.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“To keep the casualties down, you see. That’s
why I ask for your help, Bibi, to keep the casualties down. We are on the same
side, are we not? I am an American and a Jew.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The order of precedence in which he had used
the words hung in the air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And I am an Israeli and a Jew,” murmured
Netanyahu. He too had his order of precedence. The financier was in no way
fazed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Precisely. But because of your education here,
you will understand how—well, how shall I phrase it?—emotional Americans can
sometimes be. May I be blunt?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A welcome relief, thought the Israeli.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If anything were done that could in some small
way keep the number of casualties down, even by a handful, both I and my
fellow-countrymen would be eternally grateful to whoever had contributed that
anything.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other half of the sentiment remained
unsaid, but Netanyahu was far too experienced a diplomat to miss it. And if
anything were done or not done that might increase those casualties, America’s
memory would be long and her revenge unpleasant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What is it you want from me?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saul Nathanson sipped his wine and gazed at the
flickering logs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Apparently, there is a man in Baghdad. Code
name—Jericho. ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he had finished, it was a thoughtful
Deputy Foreign Minister who sped out to Dulles to catch the flight home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The roadblock that got him was at the corner of Mohammed
Ibn Kassem Street and the Fourth Ring Road. When he saw it in the distance,
Mike Martin was tempted to hang a U-turn and head back the way he had come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But there were Iraqi soldiers stationed down
the road on each side at the approaches to the checkpoint, apparently just for
that purpose, and it would have been crazy to try and outrun their rifle fire
at the slow speed necessary for a U-turn. He had no choice but to drive on,
joining the end of the line of vehicles waiting for check-through.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As usual, driving through Kuwait City, he had
tried to avoid the major roads where roadblocks were likely to be set up, but
crossing any of the six Ring Roads that envelop Kuwait City in a series of
concentric bands could only be done at a major junction.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had also hoped, by driving in the middle of
the morning, to be lost in the jumble of traffic or to find the Iraqis
sheltering from the heat. But mid-October had cooled the weather and the
green-bereted Special Forces were proving a far cry from the useless Popular
Army. So he sat at the wheel of the white Volvo station wagon and waited.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It had still been black and deepest night when
he had driven the off-road far out into the desert to the south and dug up the
remainder of his explosives, guns, and ammunition, the equipment he had
promised to Abu Fouad. It had been before dawn when he made the transfer at the
lockup garage in the back streets of Firdous from the jeep to the station
wagon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Between the transfer from vehicle to vehicle
and the moment when he judged the sun to be high enough and hot enough to send
the Iraqis to seek shelter in the shade, he had even managed a two-hour nap at
the wheel of the car inside the garage. Then he had driven the station wagon
out and put the jeep inside the garage, aware that such a prized vehicle would
soon be confiscated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally he had scrubbed his face and hands and
changed his clothes, swapping the stained and desert-soiled robes of the Bedou
tribesman for the clean white <i>dish-dash</i> of the Kuwaiti doctor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The cars in front of him inched forward toward
the Iraqi infantry grouped around the concrete-filled barrels up ahead. In some
cases the soldiers simply glanced at the driver’s identity card and waved him
on; in other cases the car was pulled to one side for a search. Usually, it was
those vehicles that carried some kind of cargo that were ordered to the curb.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was uncomfortably aware of the two big
wooden trunks behind him on the floor of the cargo area, whose contents were
enough to ensure his instant arrest and hand-over to the tender mercies of the
AMAM.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally the last car ahead of him surged away,
and he pulled up to the barrels. The sergeant in charge did not bother to ask
for identity papers. Seeing the big boxes in the rear of the Volvo, the soldier
waved the station wagon to the side of the road and shouted an order to his
colleagues who waited there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An olive-drab uniform appeared at the driver’s
side window, which Martin had already rolled down. The uniform bent, and a
stubbled face appeared in the open window.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Out,” said the soldier. Martin got out and straightened
up. He smiled politely. A sergeant with a hard, pockmarked face walked up. The
private soldier wandered round to the rear door and peered in at the boxes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Papers,” said the sergeant. He studied the ID
card that Martin offered, and his glance flickered from the blurred face behind
the plastic to the one standing in front of him. If he saw any difference
between the British officer facing him and the store clerk of the Al-Khalifa
Trading Corporation whose portrait had been used for the card, he gave no sign.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The identity card had been dated as issued a
year earlier, and in a year a man can decide to shave his beard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are a doctor?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, Sergeant. I work at the hospital.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“On the Jahra road.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“To the Amiri hospital, in Dasman.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sergeant was clearly not of great
education, and within his culture a doctor rated as a man of considerable
learning and stature. He grunted and walked to the back of the station wagon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Open,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin unlocked the rear door, and it swung up
above their heads. The sergeant stared at the two trunks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What are these?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Samples, Sergeant. They are needed by the
research laboratory at the Amiri.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Open.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin withdrew several small brass keys from
the pocket of his <i>dish-dash</i>. The boxes were of the cabin-trunk or
portmanteau type, purchased from a luggage store, and each had two brass locks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You know these trunks are refrigerated?” said
Martin conversationally, as he fiddled with the keys.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Refrigerated?” The sergeant was mystified by
the word.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, Sergeant. The interiors are cold. They
keep the cultures at a constant low temperature. That guarantees that they
remain inert. I’m afraid if I open up, the cold air will escape and they will
become very active. Better stand back.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the phrase “stand back,” the sergeant
scowled and unslung his carbine, pointing it at Martin, suspecting the boxes
must contain some kind of weapon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you mean?” he snarled. Martin shrugged
apologetically.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m sorry, but I can’t prevent it. The germs
will just escape into the air around us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Germs—what germs?” The sergeant was confused
and angry, as much with his own ignorance as with the doctor’s manner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Didn’t I say where I worked?” he asked mildly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, at the hospital.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“True. The isolation hospital. These are full
of smallpox and cholera samples for analysis.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This time the sergeant did jump back, a clear
two feet. The marks on his face were no accident—as a child he had nearly died
of smallpox.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Get that stuff out of here, damn you!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin apologized again, closed the rear door,
slid behind the wheel, and drove away. An hour later, he was guided into the
fish warehouse in Shuwaikh Port and handed over his cargo to Abu Fouad.</p>

the invasion by Iraq of the Emirate of Kuwait, the most rigorous investigation has
been undertaken, both by ourselves and our British allies, of the precise size,

say, with the usual benefit of hindsight, that such an analysis should have

forces of Iraq alone, with its standing army of a million and a quarter men,

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>Two years ago, it was
estimated that if the effect of the war with Iran had been to reduce the
Iranian war machine to the point where it could no longer realistically
threaten its neighbors, the damage inflicted by Iran on the Iraqi war machine
was of similar importance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>It is now clear that,
in the case of Iran, the severe purchasing embargo deliberately created by
ourselves and our British colleagues has caused the situation to remain much the
same. In the case of Iraq, however, the two intervening years have been filled
by a rearmament program of appalling vigor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>You will recall, Mr. Secretary,
that Western policy in the Gulf area and indeed the entire Middle East has long
been based upon the concept of balance: the notion that stability and therefore
the status quo can only be maintained if no nation in the area is permitted to
acquire such power as to threaten into submission all its neighbors and thus
establish dominance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Itzhak, we really have to go along with them
on this one.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Prime Minister of Israel seemed, as always,
dwarfed by the big swivel chair and the desk in front of it, as his Deputy
Foreign Minister confronted him in the premier’s fortified private office
beneath the Knesset in Jerusalem. The two Uzi-toting paratroopers outside the
heavy, steel-lined timber door could hear nothing of what went on inside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Itzhak Shamir glowered across the desk, his
short legs swinging free above the carpet, although there was a specially
fitted footrest if he needed it. His lined, pugnacious face beneath the
grizzled gray hair made him seem even more like some northern troll.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His Deputy Foreign Minister was different from
the Prime Minister in every way: tall where the national leader was short,
well-tailored where Shamir was rumpled, urbane where he was choleric. Yet they
got along extremely well, sharing the same uncompromising vision of their
country and of Palestinians, so that the Russian-born Prime Minister had had no
hesitation in picking and promoting the cosmopolitan diplomat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Benjamin Netanyahu had made his case well.
Israel needed America: her goodwill, which had once been automatically
guaranteed by the power of the Jewish lobby but was now under siege on Capitol
Hill and in the American media; her donations, her weaponry, her veto in the
Security Council. That was an awful lot to jeopardize for one alleged Iraqi
agent being run by Kobi Dror from down there in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let them have this Jericho, whoever he is,”
urged Netanyahu. “If he helps them destroy Saddam Hussein, the better for us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Prime Minister grunted, nodded, and reached
for his intercom.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Get on to General Dror, and tell him I need to
see him here in my office,” he told his private secretary. “No, not when he’s
free. Now.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Four hours later, Kobi Dror left his Prime
Minister’s office. He was seething. Indeed, he told himself as his car swung
down the hill out of Jerusalem and onto the broad highway back to Tel Aviv, he
did not recall when he had been so angry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To be told by your own Prime Minister that you
were wrong was bad enough. To be told he was a stupid asshole was something he
could have done without.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Normally he took pleasure in looking at the
pine forests where, during the siege of Jerusalem when the highway of today had
been a rutted track, his father and others had battled to punch a hole through
the Palestinian lines and relieve the city. But not today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Back in his office, he summoned Sami Gershon
and told him the news.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How the hell did the Americans know?” he
shouted. “Who leaked?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No one inside the Office,” Gershon said with
finality. “What about that professor? I see he’s just got back from London.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Damned traitor,” snarled Dror. “I’ll break
him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Brits probably got him drunk,” suggested
Gershon. “Boasting in his cups. Leave it, Kobi. The damage is done. What have
we got to do?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Tell them everything about Jericho,” snapped
Dror. “I won’t do it. Send Sharon. Let him do it. The meeting’s in London,
where the leak took place.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gershon thought it over and grinned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What’s so funny?” asked Dror.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Just this. We can’t contact Jericho anymore.
Just let <i>them </i>try. We still don’t know who the bastard is. Let them find
out. With any luck, they’ll make a camel’s ass out of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dror thought it over, and eventually a sly
smile spread across his face. “Send Sharon tonight,” he said. “Then we launch
another project. I’ve had it in my mind for some time. We’ll call it Operation
Joshua.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why?” asked Gershon, perplexed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t you remember exactly what Joshua did to
Jericho?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The London meeting was deemed important enough for Bill
Stewart, Langley’s Deputy Director (Operations) to cross the Atlantic
personally, accompanied by Chip Barber of the Middle East Division. They stayed
at one of the Company’s safe houses, an apartment not far from the embassy in
Grosvenor Square, and had dinner with a Deputy Director of the SIS and Steve
Laing. The Deputy Director was for protocol, given Stewart’s rank; he would be
replaced at the debriefing of David Sharon by Simon Paxman, who was in charge
of Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>David Sharon flew in from Tel Aviv under
another name and was met by a <i>katsa</i> from the Israeli embassy in Palace
Green. The British counterintelligence service MI-5—which does not like foreign
agents, even friendly ones, playing games at the port of entry—had been alerted
by SIS and spotted the waiting <i>katsa</i> from the embassy. As soon as he
greeted the new arrival, “Mr. Eliyahu,” off the Tel Aviv flight, the MI-S group
moved in, warmly welcoming Mr. Sharon to London, and offering every facility to
make his stay pleasant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two angry Israelis were escorted to their
car, waved away from the concourse entrance, and then followed sedately into
central London. The massed bands of the Brigade of Guards could not have done a
better job.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The debriefing of David Sharon began the
following morning, and it took the whole day and half the night. The SIS elected
to use one of their own safe houses, a well-protected and efficiently “wired”
apartment in South Kensington.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was (and still is) a large and spacious
place, of which the dining room served as the site for the conference. One of
the bedrooms housed the banks of tape recorders, and two technicians who
recorded every word spoken. A trim young woman brought over from Century
commandeered the kitchen and masterminded a convoy of trays of coffee and
sandwiches to the six men grouped around the dining table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two fit-looking men in the lobby downstairs
spent the day pretending to mend the perfectly functioning elevator, while in
fact ensuring that none but the other known inhabitants of the building got
above the ground-floor level.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the dining table were David Sharon and the <i>katsa</i>
from the London embassy, who was a declared agent anyway; the two Americans,
Stewart and Barber from Langley; and the two SIS men, Laing and Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the Americans’ bidding, Sharon started at
the beginning of the tale and told it the way it had happened.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A mercenary? A walk-in mercenary?” queried
Stewart at one point. “You’re not putting me on?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“My instructions are to be absolutely frank,”
said Sharon. “That was the way it happened.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Americans had nothing against a mercenary.
Indeed, it was an advantage. Among all the motives for betraying one’s country,
money is the simplest and easiest for the recruiter agency. With a mercenary
one knows where one is. There are no tortured feelings of regret, no angst of
self-disgust, no fragile ego to be massaged and flattered, no ruffled feathers
to be smoothed. A mercenary in the intelligence world is like a whore. No
tiresome candle-lit dinners and sweet nothings are necessary. A fistful of
dollars on the dressing table will do nicely.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sharon described the frantic search for someone
who could live inside Baghdad under diplomatic cover on extended stay, and the
Hobson’s-choice selection of Alfonso Benz Moncada, his intensive training in
Santiago, and his reinfiltration to run Jericho for two years.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hang on,” said Stewart. “This <i>amateur </i>ran
Jericho for two years? Made seventy collections from the drops and got away
with it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yep. On my life,” said Sharon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you figure, Steve?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing shrugged. “Beginner’s luck. Wouldn’t have
liked to try it in East Berlin or Moscow.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Right,” said Stewart. “And he never got tailed
to a drop? Never compromised?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No,” said Sharon. “He was tailed a few times,
but always in a sporadic and clumsy way. Going from his home to the Economic
Commission building or back, and once when he was heading for a drop. But he
saw them and aborted.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Just supposing,” said Laing, “he actually <i>was</i>
tailed to a drop by a real team of watchers. Rahmani’s Counterintelligence boys
stake out the drop and roll up Jericho himself. Under persuasion, Jericho has
to cooperate. ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then the product would have gone down in
value,” said Sharon. “But Jericho really was doing a lot of damage. Rahmani
wouldn’t have allowed that to go on. We’d have seen a public trial and hanging
of Jericho, and Moncada would have been expelled, if lucky.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It seems the trackers were AMAM people, even
though foreigners are supposed to be Rahmani’s turf. Whatever, they were as
clumsy as usual. Moncada spotted them without trouble. You know how the AMAM is
always trying to move into counterintelligence work.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The listeners nodded. Interdepartmental rivalry
was nothing new—it happened in their own countries.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When Sharon reached the point where Moncada was
abruptly withdrawn from Iraq, Bill Stewart let out an expletive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You mean he’s switched off, out of contact?
Are you telling us Jericho is on the loose with no controller?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the point,” said Sharon patiently. He
turned to Chip Barber. “When General Dror said he was running no agent in
Baghdad, he meant it. The Mossad was convinced that Jericho, as an ongoing
operation, was belly-up.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber shot the young <i>katsa</i> a look that
said, “Pull the other leg, son. It’s got bells on.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We want to reestablish contact,” said Laing
smoothly. “How?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sharon laid out all six of the locations of the
dead-letter boxes. During his two years Moncada had changed two of them; in one
case because a location was bulldozed for redevelopment, in another because a
derelict shop was refurbished and reoccupied. But the six functioning drops and
the six places where the alerting chalk marks had to be placed were the
up-to-date ones that had come from his final briefing after his expulsion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The exact location of these drops and of the
sites for the chalk marks were noted to the inch.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe we could get a friendly diplomat to
approach him at a function, tell him he’s back in action and the money’s better,”
suggested Barber. “Get around all this crap under bricks and flagstones.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No,” said Sharon. “It’s the drops, or you can’t
contact him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why?” asked Stewart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re going to find this hard to believe, but
I swear it’s true. We never found out who he is.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four Western agents stared at Sharon for
several minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You never identified him?” asked Stewart
slowly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. We tried. We asked him to identify himself
for his own protection. He refused, threatened to shut off if we persisted. We
did handwriting analyses, psychoportraits. We cross-indexed the information he
could produce and the stuff he couldn’t get at. We ended up with a list of
thirty, maybe forty men, all around Saddam Hussein, all within the
Revolutionary Command Council, the Army High Command, or the senior ranks of
the Ba’ath Party.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Never could get closer than that. Twice we
slipped a technical term in English into our demands. Each time they came back
with a query. It seems he only speaks no or very limited English. But that
could be a blind. He could be fluent, but if we knew that, it would narrow the
field to two or three. So he always writes in script, in Arabic.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stewart grunted, convinced. “Sounds like Deep
Throat.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Surely Woodward and Bernstein identified Deep
Throat?” suggested Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So they claim, but I doubt it,” said Stewart. “I
figure the guy stayed in deep shadow, like Jericho.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Darkness had long fallen by the time the four
of them finally let an exhausted David Sharon go back to his embassy. If there
was anything more he could have told them, they were not going to get it out of
him. But Steve Laing was certain that this time the Mossad had come clean. Bill
Stewart had told him of the level of the pressure that had been exercised in
Washington.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two British and two American intelligence
officers, tired of sandwiches and coffee, adjourned to a restaurant half a mile
away. Bill Stewart, who had an ulcer that twelve hours of sandwiches and high
stress had not improved, toyed with a plate of smoked salmon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s a bastard, Steve. It’s a real four-eyed
bastard. Like the Mossad, we’ll have to try and find an accredited diplomat
already trained in all the tradecraft and get him to work for us. Pay him if we
have to. Langley’s prepared to spend a lot of money on this. Jericho’s
information could save us a lot of lives when the fighting starts.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So who does that leave us?” said Barber. “Half
the embassies in Baghdad are closed down already. The rest must be under heavy
surveillance. The Irish, Swiss, Swedes, Finns?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The neutrals won’t play ball,” said Laing. “And
I doubt they’ve got a trained agent posted to Baghdad on their own account.
Forget Third World embassies—it means starting a whole recruiting and training
program.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We don’t have the time, Steve. This is urgent.
We can’t go down the same road the Israelis went. Three weeks is crazy. It
might have worked then, but Baghdad is on a war footing now. Things have to be
much tighter in there. Starting cold, I’d want a minimum three months to give a
diplomat the tradecraft.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stewart nodded agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Failing that, someone with legitimate access.
Some businessmen are still going in and out, especially the Germans. We could
produce a convincing German, or a Japanese.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The trouble is, they’re short-stay chappies.
Ideally, one wants someone to mother-hen this Jericho for the next—what? Four
months. What about a journalist?” suggested Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman shook his head. “I’ve been talking with
them all when they come out; being journalists, they get total surveillance.
Snooping around back alleys won’t work for a foreign correspondent—they all
have a minder from the AMAM with them, all the time. Besides, don’t forget that
outside an accredited diplomat, we’re talking about a black operation. Anyone
want to dwell on what happens to an agent falling into Omar Khatib’s hands?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four men at the table had heard of the
brutal reputation of Khatib, head of the AMAM, nicknamed Al-Mu’azib, “the
Tormentor.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Risks just may have to be taken,” observed
Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I was referring more to acceptance,” Paxman
pointed out. “What businessman or reporter would ever agree, knowing what would
be in store if he were caught? I’d prefer the KGB to the AMAM.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bill Stewart put down his fork in frustration
and called for another glass of milk.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, that’s it then—short of finding a
trained agent who can pass for an Iraqi.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman shot a glance at Steve Laing, who
thought for a moment and slowly nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We’ve got a guy who can,” said Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A tame Arab? So has the Mossad, so have we,”
said Stewart, “but not at this level. Message-carriers, gofers. This is
high-risk, high-value.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, a Brit, a major in the SAS.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stewart paused, his milk glass halfway to his
mouth. Barber put down his knife and fork and ceased chewing his steak.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Speaking Arabic is one thing. Passing for an
Iraqi inside Iraq is a whole different ball game,” said Stewart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s dark-skinned, black-haired, brown-eyed,
but he’s a hundred percent British. He was born and raised there. He can pass
for one.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And he’s fully trained in covert operations?”
asked Barber. “Shit, where the hell is he?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Actually, he’s in Kuwait at the moment,” said
Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Damn. You mean he’s stuck in there, holed up?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. He seems to be moving about quite freely.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So if he can get out, what the hell’s he
doing?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Killing Iraqis, actually.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stewart thought it over and nodded slowly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Big balls,” he murmured. “Can you get him out
of there? We’d like to borrow him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I suppose so, next time he comes on the radio.
We would have to run him, though. And share the product.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stewart nodded again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I guess so. You guys brought us Jericho. It’s
a deal. I’ll clear it with the Judge.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman rose and wiped his mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’d better go tell Riyadh,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mike Martin was a man accustomed to making his own luck, but
his life was saved that October by a fluke.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was due to make a radio call to the
designated SIS house in the outskirts of Riyadh during the night of the
nineteenth, the same night the four senior intelligence officers from the CIA
and Century House were dining in South Kensington.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Had he done so, he would have been off the air,
due to the two-hour time difference, before Simon Paxman could return to
Century House and alert Riyadh that he was wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Worse, he would have been on the air for five
to ten minutes, discussing with Riyadh ways of securing a resupply of arms and
explosives.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In fact, he was in the lockup garage where he
kept his jeep just before midnight, only to discover that the vehicle had a
flat tire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Cursing, he spent an hour with the jeep
jacked-up, struggling to remove the wheel nuts, which had been almost cemented
into place by a mixture of grease and desert sand. At a quarter to one he
rolled out of the garage, and within half a mile he noticed that even his spare
tire had developed a slow leak.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was nothing for it but to return to the
garage and abandon the radio call to Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took two days to have both tires repaired,
and it was not until the night of the twenty-first that he found himself deep
in the desert, far to the south of the city, turning his small satellite dish
in the direction of the Saudi capital many hundreds of miles away, using the
Send button to transmit a series of quick blips to indicate it was he who was
calling and that he was about to come on the air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His radio was basic, a ten-channel
fixed-crystal set, with one channel designated for each day of the month in
rotation. On the twenty-first, he was using channel one. Having identified
himself, he switched to Receive and waited. Within seconds a low voice replied:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Rocky Mountain, Black Bear, read you five.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The codes identifying both Riyadh and Martin
corresponded with the date and the channel, just in case someone hostile tried
to muscle in on the waveband.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin went to Send and spoke several
sentences.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the outskirts of Kuwait City to the north, a
young Iraqi technician was alerted by a pulsing light on the console he was
monitoring in the commandeered apartment on top of a residential building. One
of his sweepers had caught the transmission and locked on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Captain,” he called urgently. An officer from
Hassan Rahmani’s Counterintelligence signals section strode over to the
console. The light still pulsed, and the technician was easing a dial to secure
a bearing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Someone has just come on the air.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Out in the desert, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The technician listened through his earphones
as his direction-finders stabilized on the source of the transmission.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Electronically scrambled transmission, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That has to be him. The boss was right. What’s
the bearing?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The officer was reaching for the telephone to
alert his other two monitoring units, the trailer trucks parked at Jahra and
the Al Adan hospital down near the coast.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Two-oh-two degrees compass.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two-oh-two degrees was twenty-two degrees west
of due south, and there was absolutely nothing out in that direction but the
Kuwaiti desert, which ran all the way to join the Saudi desert at the border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Frequency?” barked the officer as the Jahra
trailer came on the line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The tracker gave it to him, a rare channel down
in the very-low-frequency range.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Lieutenant,” he called over his shoulder, “get
on to Ahmadi air base. Tell them to get that helicopter airborne. We’ve got a
fix.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Far away in the desert, Martin finished what he
had to say and switched to Receive to get the answer from Riyadh. It was not
what he had expected. He himself had spoken for only fifteen seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Rocky Mountain, Black Bear, return to the
cave. I say again, return to the cave. Top urgent. Over and out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iraqi captain gave the frequency to both
his other monitoring stations. In Jahra and the hospital grounds other
technicians rolled their source-tracers to the indicated frequency, and above
their heads four-foot-diameter dishes swung from side to side. The one on the
coast covered the area from Kuwait’s northern border with Iraq down to the
border with Saudi Arabia. The Jahra scanners swept east to west, from the sea
in the east to the Iraqi deserts in the west.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Between the three of them, they could
triangulate a fix to within a hundred yards and give a heading and distance to
the Hind helicopter and its ten armed soldiers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Still there?” asked the captain.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The technician scanned the circular screen in
front of him, calibrated around its edge with the points of the compass. The
center of the dish represented the point where he sat. Seconds earlier, there
had been a glittering line across the screen, running from the center to
compass heading 202. Now the screen was blank. It would only light up when the
man out there transmitted again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, sir. He’s gone off the air. Probably
listening to the reply.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’ll come back,” said the captain.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But he was wrong. Black Bear had frowned over
his sudden instructions from Riyadh, switched off his power, closed down his
transmitter, and folded up his antenna.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iraqis monitored the frequency for the rest
of the night until dawn, when the Hind at Al Ahmadi shut off its rotors and the
stiff, tired soldiers climbed back out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Simon Paxman was asleep on a cot in his office when the
phone rang. It was a cipher clerk from Communications in the basement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll come down,” said Paxman. It was a very
short message, just decrypted, from Riyadh. Martin had been in touch and had
been given his orders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From his office Paxman phoned Chip Barber in
his CIA flat off Grosvenor Square.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s on his way back,” he said. “We don’t know
when he’ll cross the border. Steve says he wants me to go down there. You
coming?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Right,” said Barber. “The DDO’s going back to
Langley on the morning flight. But I’m coming with you. This guy I have to see.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During October 22 the American embassy and the
British Foreign Office each approached the Saudi embassy for a short-notice
accreditation of a new junior diplomat to Riyadh. There was no problem. Two
passports, neither in the name of Barber or Paxman, were visaed without delay,
and the men caught the 8:45 <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> flight
out of Heathrow, arriving at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Riyadh
just before dawn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An American embassy car met Chip Barber and
took him straight to the U.S. mission, where the hugely expanded CIA operation
was based, while a smaller unmarked sedan took Paxman away to the villa where
the British SIS operation had quartered itself. The first news Paxman got was
that Martin had apparently not crossed the border and checked in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Riyadh’s order to return to base was, from
Martin’s point of view, easier said than done. He had returned from the desert
well before dawn of October 22 and spent the day closing his operation down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A message was left under the tombstone of Able
Seaman Shepton in the Christian cemetery to explain to Mr. Al-Khalifa that he
had regretfully had to leave Kuwait. A further note for Abu Fouad explained
where and how to collect the remaining items of arms and explosives that were
still stashed in the two of his once-six villas.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By afternoon he had finished, and he drove his
battered pickup truck out to the camel farm beyond Sulaibiya, where the last
outposts of Kuwait City ran out and the desert began.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His camels were still there and in good
condition. The calf had been weaned and was on its way to becoming a valuable
animal, so he used it to settle the debt he owed the owner of the farm who had
taken care of it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shortly before dusk he mounted the she-camel
and headed south-southwest, so that when night fell and the chill darkness of the
desert enfolded him, Martin was well clear of the last signs of habitation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took him four hours instead of the usual one
to arrive at the place where he had buried his radio, a site marked by the
gutted and rusted wreck of a car that had once, long ago, broken down and been
abandoned there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He hid the radio beneath the consignment of
dates that he had stored in the panniers. Even with these, the camel was far
less laden than she had been when hauling her load of explosives and weapons
into Kuwait nine weeks earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If she was grateful, she gave no sign of it,
rumbling and spitting with disgust at having been evicted from her comfortable
corral at the farm. But she never slackened her swaying gait as the miles
slipped by in the darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a different journey, however, from that
of mid-August. As he moved south, Martin saw more and more signs of the huge
Iraqi army that now infested the area south of the city, spreading itself
farther and farther west toward the Iraqi border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Usually he could see the glow of the lights of
the various oil wells that stud the desert here and, knowing the Iraqis would
be likely to occupy them, move away into the sands to avoid them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On other occasions he smelled the woodsmoke
from an Iraqi fire and was able to skirt the encampments in time. Once he
almost stumbled onto a battalion of tanks, hull-down behind horseshoe-shaped
walls of sand facing the Americans and the Saudis across the border to the
south. He heard the clink of metal on metal just in time, pulled the bridle
sharply to the right, and slipped away back into the sand dunes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There had only been two divisions of the Iraqi
Republican Guard south of Kuwait when he had entered, and they had been farther
to the east, due south of Kuwait City.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now the Hammurabi Division had joined the other
two, and eleven further divisions, mainly of the regular army, had been ordered
by Saddam Hussein into south Kuwait to match the American and Coalition buildup
on the other side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Fourteen divisions is a lot of manpower, even
spread over a desert. Fortunately for Martin, they seemed to post no sentinels
and slept soundly beneath their vehicles, but the sheer numbers of them pushed
him farther and farther west.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The short fifty-kilometer hike from the Saudi
village of Hamatiyyat to the Kuwaiti camel farm was out of the question; he was
being pushed west toward the Iraqi border, marked by the deep cleft of the Wadi
el Batin, which he did not really want to have to cross.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dawn found him well to the west of the
Manageesh oil field and still north of the Al Mufrad police station, which
marks the border at one of the pre-emergency crossing points.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The ground had become more hilly, and he found
a cluster of rocks in which to spend the day. As the sun rose, he hobbled the
camel, who sniffed the bare sand and rock in disgust, finding not even a tasty
thorn bush for breakfast, rolled himself in the camel blanket, and went to
sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shortly after noon, he was awakened by the
clank of tanks quite close by and realized he was too near the main road that
runs from Jahra, in Kuwait, due southwest to cross into Saudi Arabia at the Al
Salmi customs station. After sundown he waited until almost midnight before
setting out. He knew the border could not be more than twelve miles to the
south.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His late start enabled him to move between the
last Iraqi patrols at about three <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>,
that hour when human spirits are lowest and sentries tend to doze.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the light of the moon, he saw the Qaimat
Subah police station slip by to one side, and two miles farther on, he knew he
had crossed the border. To be on the safe side, he kept going until he cut into
the lateral road that runs east-west between Hamatiyyat and Ar-Rugi. There he
stopped and assembled his radio dish.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because the Iraqis to the north had dug in
several miles on the Kuwait side of the border, and because General Schwarzkopf’s
plan called for the Desert Shield forces also to lie back to ensure that, if
attacked, they would know the Iraqis had truly invaded Saudi Arabia, Martin
found himself in an empty no-man’s-land. One day, that empty land would become
a seething torrent of Saudi and American forces streaming north into Kuwait,
but in the predawn darkness of October 24 he had it to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Simon Paxman was awakened by-a junior member of the
Century House team who inhabited the villa.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Black Bear has come on the air, Simon. He’s
crossed the border.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman was out of bed and running into the
radio room in his pajamas. A radio operator was on a swivel chair facing a
console that ran along one complete wall of what had once been quite an elegant
bedroom. Because it was now the twenty-fourth, the codes had changed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Corpus Christi to Texas Ranger, where are you?
Say again, state your position, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The voice sounded tinny when it came out of the
console speaker, but it was perfectly clear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“South of Qaimat Subah, on the
Hamatiyyat-to-Ar-Rugi road.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The operator turned to glance at Paxman. The
SIS man pressed the Send button and said:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ranger, stay there. There’s a taxi coming for
you. Acknowledge.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Understood,” said the voice. “I’ll wait for
the black cab.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not actually a black cab. It was an
American Blackhawk helicopter that swept down the road two hours later, a
loadmaster strapped in the open door beside the pilot, masked with a pair of
binoculars, scanning the dusty track that purported to be a road. From two
hundred feet, the loadmaster spotted a man beside a camel and was about to fly
on when the man waved.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Blackhawk slowed to a hover and watched the
Bedou warily. So far as the pilot was concerned, this was uncomfortably close
to the border. Still, the map position he had been given by his squadron
intelligence officer was accurate, and there was no one else in sight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was Chip Barber who had arranged with the
U.S. Army detail at the Riyadh military air base to lend a Blackhawk to pick up
a Britisher who was due to come over the border out of Kuwait. The Blackhawk
had the range, but no one had told the Army pilot about a Bedouin tribesman
with a camel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As the American Army aviators watched from two
hundred feet, the man on the ground arranged a series of stones. When he had
finished, he stood back. The loadmaster focused his glasses on the display of
stones. They said simply: Hi there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The loadmaster spoke into his mask.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Must be the guy. Let’s go get him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pilot nodded, and the Blackhawk curved
around and down until it hovered a foot off the ground twenty yards from the
man and his beast.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had already taken the panniers and the
heavy camel saddle off his animal and dumped them by the roadside. The radio
set and his personal sidearm, the Browning 9-mm. thirteen-shot automatic
favored by the SAS, were in the tote bag slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As the helicopter came down, the camel panicked
and cantered off. Martin watched her go. She had served him well, despite her
foul temper. She would come to no harm alone in that desert. So far as she was
concerned, she was home. She would roam freely, finding her own fodder and
water, until some Bedou found her, saw no brand mark, and gleefully took her
for his own.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin ducked under the whirling blades and ran
to the open door. Over the whine of the rotors, the loadmaster shouted:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Your name, please?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Major Martin.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A hand came out of the aperture to pull Martin
into the hull.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Welcome aboard, Major.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At that point the engine noise drowned out
further talk, the loadmaster handed Martin a pair of ear-defenders to muffle
the roar, and they settled back for the run to Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Approaching the city, the pilot was diverted to
a villa on the outskirts of the city. Next to it was a patch of waste ground
where someone had laid out three rows of bright orange seat-cushions in the
form of an H. As the Blackhawk hovered, the man in Arab robes jumped the three
feet to the ground, turned to wave his thanks to the crew, and strode toward
the house as the helicopter lifted away. Two house servants began to gather up
the cushions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin walked through the arched doorway in the
villa wall and found himself in a flagged courtyard. Two men were emerging from
the door of the house. One he recognized from the SAS headquarters in West
London all those weeks ago.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Simon Paxman,” said the younger man, holding
out his hand. “Bloody good to have you back. This is Chip Barber, one of our
cousins from Langley.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber shook hands and took in the figure
before him: a stained, off-white robe from chin to floor, a striped blanket
folded and hung over one shoulder, a red-and-white-checked <i>keffiyeh</i> with
two black cords to hold it in place, a lean, hard, dark-eyed, black-stubbled face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good to know you, Major. Heard a lot about
you.” His nose twitched. “Guess you could use a hot tub, eh?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, yes, I’ll get that sorted out at once,”
said Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin nodded, said “Thanks,” and walked into
the cool of the villa. Paxman and Barber came in behind him. Barber was
privately elated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Damn,” he thought to himself. “I do believe
this bastard could even do it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took three consecutive baths in the marble
tub of the villa, obtained for the British by Prince Khaled bin Sultan, for
Martin to scrape off the dirt and sweat of weeks. He sat with a towel around
his waist while a barber summoned for the purpose gave his matted hair a cut,
then he shaved with Simon Paxman’s wash-kit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His <i>keffiyeh</i>, blanket, robes, and
sandals had been taken away to the garden, where a Saudi servant had turned
them into a satisfactory bonfire. Two hours later, in a pair of Paxman’s light
cotton trousers and a short-sleeved shirt, Mike Martin sat at the dining table
and contemplated a five-course lunch.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Would you mind telling me,” he asked, “why you
pulled me out?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was Chip Barber who answered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good question, Major. Damn good question.
Deserves a damn good answer. Right? Fact is, we’d like you to go into Baghdad.
Next week. Salad or fish?”</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942761">Chapter 10</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Both the CIA and the SIS were in a hurry. Although little
mention was made of it then or since, by late October there had been
established in Riyadh a very large CIA presence and operation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before too long, the CIA presence was at
loggerheads with the military chieftaincy a mile away in the warren of planning
rooms beneath the Saudi Defense Ministry. The mood, certainly of the air
generals, was one of conviction that with the skillful use of the amazing array
of technical wizardry at their disposal, they could ascertain all they needed
to know about Iraq’s defenses and preparations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And an amazing array it was. Apart from the
satellites in space supplying their constant stream of pictures of the land of
Saddam Hussein; apart from the Aurora and the U-2 doing the same but at closer
range, there were other machines of daunting complexity dedicated to providing
airborne information.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Another breed of satellite, in geosynchronous
position, hovering over the Middle East, was dedicated to listening to what the
Iraqis said, and these satellites caught every word uttered on an open line.
They could not catch the planning conferences held on those 45,000 miles of
buried fiber-optic cables.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Among the airplanes, chief was the Airborne
Warning and Control System, known as AWACS. These were Boeing 707 airliners,
carrying a huge radar dome mounted on their backs. Turning in slow circles over
the northern Gulf, on twenty-four-hour rotating shifts, the AWACS could inform
Riyadh within seconds of any air movement over Iraq. Hardly an Iraqi plane
could move or mission take off but Riyadh knew its number, heading, course
speed, and altitude.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Backing up the AWACS was another Boeing 707
conversion, the E8-A, known as J-STAR, which did for movements on the ground
what AWACS did for movements in the air. With its big Norden radar scanning
downward and sideways, so that it could cover Iraq without ever entering Iraqi
airspace, the J-STAR could pick up almost any piece of metal that began to
move.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The combination of these and many more
technical miracles on which Washington had spent billions and billions of
dollars convinced the generals that if it was said, they could hear it, if it
moved, they could see it, and if they knew about it, they could destroy it.
They could do it, moreover, come rain or fog, night or day. Never again would
the enemy be able to shelter under a canopy of jungle trees and escape
detection. The eyes-in-the-sky would see it all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The intelligence officers from Langley were
skeptical, and it showed. Doubts were for civilians. In the face of this the
military became irritable. It had a tough job to do, it was going to do it, and
cold water it did not need.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the British side the situation was
different. The SIS operation in the Gulf Theater was nothing like that of the
CIA, but it was still a large operation by the standards of Century House, and
in the manner of Century it was lower profile and more secretive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Moreover, the British had appointed as
commander of all U.K. forces in the Gulf, and second-in-command to General
Schwarzkopf, an unusual soldier of uncommon background.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Norman Schwarzkopf was a big, burly man of
considerable military prowess and very much a soldier’s soldier. Known either
as Stormin’ Norman or “the Bear,” his mood could vary from genial bonhomie to
explosions of temper, always short-lived, which his staff referred to as the
general going ballistic. His British counterpart could not have been more
different.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lieutenant General Sir Peter de la Billière,
who had arrived in early October to take command of the Brits, was a
deceptively slight, lean, wiry man of diffident manner and reluctant speech.
The big American extrovert and the slim British introvert made an odd
partnership, which succeeded only because each knew enough of the other to
recognize what lay behind the up-front presentation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sir Peter, known to the troops as P.B., was the
most decorated soldier in the British Army, a matter of which he would never
speak under any circumstances. Only those who had been with him in his various
campaigns would occasionally mutter into their beer glasses of the icy cool
under fire that had caused all those “gongs” to be pinned to his tunic. He had
also once been commanding officer of the SAS, a background that gave him a most
useful knowledge of the Gulf, of Arabic, and of covert operations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because the British commander had worked before
with the SIS, the Century House team found in him a more accustomed ear to
listen to their reservations than in the CIA group.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The SAS already had a good presence in the Gulf
Theater, holed up in their own secluded camp in the corner of a larger military
base outside Riyadh. As a former commander of these men, General P.B. was
concerned that their remarkable talents should not be wasted on workaday tasks
that infantry or paratroopers could do. These men were specialists in deep
penetration and hostage-recovery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sitting in that villa outside Riyadh during the
last week of October, the CIA and SIS team came up with an operation that was
very much within the scope of the SAS. The operation was put to the local SAS
commander, and he went to work on his planning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The entire afternoon of Mike Martin’s first day
at the villa was spent in explaining to him the discovery by the Anglo-American
Allies of the existence of the renegade in Baghdad who had been code-named
Jericho. They told him he still had the right to refuse and to rejoin the
regiment. During the evening he thought it over. Then he told the CIA-SIS
briefing officers:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll go in. But I have my conditions, and I
want them met.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The main problem, they all acknowledged, would
be his cover story. This was not a quick in-and-out mission, depending on speed
and daring to outwit the counterintelligence net. Nor could he count on covert
support and assistance such as he had met in Kuwait. Nor could he wander the
desert outside Baghdad as an errant Bedou tribesman. All Iraq was by then a
great armed camp. Even areas that on the map seemed desolate and empty were
crisscrossed with army patrols. Inside Baghdad, Army and AMAM check-squads were
everywhere, the Military Police looking for deserters and the AMAM for anyone
at all who might be suspicious.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fear in which the AMAM was held was well
known to everyone at the villa. Reports from businessmen and journalists, and
from British and American diplomats before their expulsion, amply testified to
the omnipresence of the Secret Police, who kept Iraq’s citizens in dread and
trembling.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If Martin went in at all, he would have to stay
in. Running an agent like Jericho would not be easy for him. First, the man
would have to be traced through the dead-letter boxes and realerted that he was
back in operation. The boxes might already be compromised and under
surveillance. Jericho might have been caught and forced to confess all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>More, Martin would have to establish a place to
live, a base where he could send and receive messages. He would have to prowl
the city, servicing the drops if Jericho’s stream of inside information
resumed, although it would now be destined for new masters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, and worst of all, there could be no
diplomatic cover, no protective shield to spare him the horrors that would
follow capture and exposure. For such a man, the interrogation cells of Abu
Ghraib would be ready.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What—er, exactly did you have in mind?” asked
Paxman when Martin had made his demand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If I can’t be a diplomat, I want to be
attached to a diplomatic household.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s not easy, old boy. Embassies are
watched.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I didn’t say embassy. I said diplomatic
household.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A kind of a chauffeur?” asked Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. Too obvious. The driver has to stay at the
wheel of the car. He drives the diplomat around and is watched like the
diplomat.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What, then?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Unless things have changed radically, many of
the senior diplomats live outside the embassy building, and if the rank is senior
enough, they will have a villa in its own walled garden. In the old days such
houses always rated a gardener-handyman.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A gardener?” queried Barber. “For chrissake,
that’s a manual laborer. You’d be picked up and recruited into the Army.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. The gardener-handyman does everything
outside the house. He keeps the garden, goes shopping on his bicycle for fish
at the fish market, fruit and vegetables, bread and oil. He lives in a shack at
the bottom of the garden.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So what’s the point, Mike?” asked Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The point is, he’s invisible. He’s so
ordinary, no one notices him. If he’s stopped, his ID card is in order and he
carries a letter on embassy paper, in Arabic, explaining that he works for the
diplomat and is exempt from service, and would the authorities please let him
go about his business. Unless he is doing something wrong, any policeman who
makes trouble for him is up against a formal complaint from the embassy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The intelligence officers thought it over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It might work,” admitted Barber. “Ordinary,
invisible. What do you think, Simon?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well,” said Paxman, “the diplomat would have
to be in on it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Only partly,” said Martin. “He would simply
have to have a flat order from his government to receive and employ the man who
will present himself, then face the other way and get on with his job. What he
suspects is his own affair. He’ll keep his mouth shut if he wants to keep his
job and his career. That’s if the order comes from high enough.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The British embassy’s out,” said Paxman. “The
Iraqis would go out of their way to offend our people.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Same with us,” said Barber. “Who do you have
in mind, Mike?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When Martin told them, they stared at him in
disbelief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You cannot be serious,” said the American.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But I am,” said Martin calmly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hell, Mike, a request like that would have to
go up to—well, the Prime Minister.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the President,” said Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, we’re all supposed to be such pals
nowadays, why not? I mean, if Jericho’s product ends up saving Allied lives, is
a phone call too much to ask?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Chip Barber glanced at his watch. The time in
Washington was still seven hours earlier than that in the Gulf. Langley would
be finishing its lunch. In London it was only two hours earlier, but senior
officers might still be at their desks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber went hotfoot back to the U.S. embassy
and sent a blitz message in code to the Deputy Director (Operations), Bill
Stewart, who, when he had read it, took it to the Director, William Webster. He
in turn called the White House and asked for a meeting with his President.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Simon Paxman was lucky. His encrypted phone
call caught Steve Laing at his desk at Century House, and after listening, the
head of Ops for Mid-East called the Chief at his home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sir Colin thought it over and placed a call to
the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robin Butler.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It is accepted that the Chief of the Secret
Intelligence Service has a right, in cases he deems to be an emergency, to ask
for and secure a personal meeting with his Prime Minister, and Margaret
Thatcher had always been notable for her accessibility to the men who ran the
intelligence services and the Special Forces. She agreed to meet the Chief in
her private office in 10 Downing Street the following morning at eight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was, as always, at work before dawn and had
almost cleared her desk when the Chief was shown in. She listened to his
bizarre request with a rather puzzled frown, demanded several explanations,
thought it over, and then, in her usual way, made her mind up without delay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll confer with President Bush as soon as he
rises, and we’ll see what we can do. This, um, man—is he really going to do
that?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That is his intention. Prime Minister.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“One of your people, Sir Colin?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, he’s a major in the SAS.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She brightened perceptibly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Remarkable fellow.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So I believe, ma’am.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When this is over, I would rather like to meet
him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m sure that can be arranged, Prime Minister.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the Chief was gone, the Downing Street
staff placed the call to the White House, even though it was still the middle
of the night, and set up the hotline connection for eight <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> Washington, one <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>P.M.</span> London. The Prime Minister’s lunch was rescheduled by
thirty minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>President George Bush, like his predecessor
Ronald Reagan, had always found it hard to refuse the British Prime Minister
something she wanted when she was firing on all cylinders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, Margaret,” said the President after
five minutes, “I’ll make the call.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He can only say no,” Mrs. Thatcher pointed
out, “and he shouldn’t. After all, we’ve jolly well done a lot for him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, we jolly well have,” said the President.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two heads of government made their calls
within an hour of each other, and the reply from the puzzled man at the other
end of the line was affirmative. He would see their representatives, in
privacy, as soon as they arrived.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That evening Bill Stewart headed out of
Washington, and Steve Laing caught the last connection of the day from
Heathrow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>If Mike Martin had any idea of the flurry of activity his
demand had started, he gave no sign of it. He spent October 26 and 27 resting,
eating, and sleeping. But he stopped shaving, allowing the dark stubble to come
through again. Work on his behalf, however, was being carried out in a number
of different places.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The SIS Station Head in Tel Aviv had visited
General Kobi Dror with a final request. The Mossad chief had stared at the
Englishman in amazement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You really are going to go ahead with this,
aren’t you?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I only know what I’ve been told to ask you,
Kobi.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody hell, on the black? You know he’ll be
caught, don’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can you do it, Kobi?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course we can do it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Twenty-four hours?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kobi Dror was playing his <i>Fiddler on the
Roof </i>role again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“For you, boychick, my right arm. But look,
this is crazy, what you are proposing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He rose and came from behind his desk, draping
an arm around the Englishman’s shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You know, we broke half our own rules, and we
were lucky. Normally, we never have our people visit a dead-letter box. It
could be a trap. For us, a dead-letter box is one-way: from the <i>katsa</i> to
the spy. For Jericho, we broke that rule. Moncada picked up the product that
way because there was no other way. And he was lucky—for two years he was
lucky. But he had diplomatic cover. Now you want ... <i>this</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He held up the small photograph of a
sad-looking Arab-featured man with tufted black hair and stubble, the photo the
Englishman had just received from Riyadh, brought in (since there are no
commercial routes between the two capitals) by General de la Billière’s
personal HS-125 twin-jet communications plane. The 125 was standing at Sde Dov
military airfield, where its livery markings had been extensively photographed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dror shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right. By tomorrow morning. My life.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Mossad has, beyond any room for quarrel,
some of the best technical services in the world. Apart from a central computer
with almost two million names and their appropriate data, apart from one of the
best lock-picking services on earth, there exists in the basement and
subbasement of Mossad headquarters a series of rooms where the temperature is
carefully controlled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>These rooms contain paper. Not just any old
paper—very special paper. Originals of just about every kind of passport in the
world lie there, along with myriad other identity cards, drivers’ licenses,
Social Security cards, and suchlike.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then there are the blanks, the unfilled
identity cards on which the penmen can work at will, using the originals as a
guide to produce forgeries of superb quality.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Identity cards are not the only speciality.
Banknotes of virtually foolproof likeness can be and are produced in great
quantities, either to help ruin the currencies of neighboring but hostile
nations, or to fund the Mossad’s black operations, the ones neither the Prime
Minister nor the Knesset knows about nor wishes to.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It had only been after some soul-searching that
the CIA and SIS had agreed to go to the Mossad for the favor, but they simply
could not produce the identity card of a forty-five-year-old Iraqi laborer with
the certainty of knowing it would pass any inspection in Iraq. No one had
bothered to find and abstract an original one to copy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Fortunately, the Sayeret Matkal, a cross-border
reconnaissance group so secret that its name cannot even be printed in Israel,
had made an incursion into Iraq two years earlier to drop an Arab <i>oter</i>
who had some low-level contact to make there. While on Iraqi soil, the agents
had surprised two working men in the fields, tied them up, and relieved them of
their identity cards.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As promised, Dror’s forgers worked through the
night and by dawn had produced an Iraqi identity card, convincingly dirty and
smudged as if from long use, in the name of Mahmoud Al-Khouri, age forty-five,
from a village in the hills north of Baghdad, working in the capital as a
laborer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The forgers did not know that Martin had taken
the name of the Mr. Al-Khouri who had tested his Arabic in a Chelsea restaurant
in early August; nor could they know that he had chosen the village from which
his father’s gardener had come, the old man who, long ago beneath a tree in
Baghdad, had told the little English boy of the place where he was born, of its
mosque and coffee shop and the fields of alfalfa and melons that surrounded it.
And there was one more thing the forgers did not know.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the morning Kobi Dror handed the identity
card to the Tel Aviv-based SIS man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This will not let him down. But I tell you,
this”—he tapped the photo with a stubby forefinger—“this, your tame Arab, will
betray you or be caught within a week.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The SIS man could only shrug. Not even he knew
that the man in the smudged photo was not an Arab at all. He had no need to
know, so he had not been told. He just did what he was told—put the card on the
HS-125, by which it was flown back to Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Clothes had also been prepared, the simple <i>dish-dash</i>
of an Iraqi working man, a dull brown <i>keffiyeh</i>, and tough, rope-soled
canvas shoes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A basket weaver, without knowing what he was
doing or why, was creating a wicker crate of osier strands to a most unusual
design. He was a poor Saudi craftsman, and the money the strange infidel was
prepared to pay was very good, so he worked with a will.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Outside the city of Riyadh, at a secret army
base, two rather special vehicles were being prepared. They had been brought by
a Hercules of the RAF from the main SAS base farther down the Arabian Peninsula
in Oman and were being stripped down and reequipped for a long and rough ride.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The essence of the conversion of the two
long-base Land-Rovers was not armor and firepower but speed and range. Each
vehicle would have to carry its normal complement of four SAS men, and one
would carry a passenger. The other would carry a big-tired cross-country
motorcycle, itself fitted with extra-long-range fuel tanks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The American Army again loaned its power on
request, this time in the form of two of its big twin-rotor Chinook workhorse
helicopters. They were just told to stand by.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mikhail Sergeivitch Gorbachev was sitting as usual at his
desk in his personal office on the seventh and top floor of the Central
Committee building on Novaya Ploshad, attended by two male secretaries, when
the intercom buzzed to announce the arrival of the two emissaries from London
and Washington.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For twenty-four hours he had been intrigued by
the requests of both the American President and the British Prime Minister that
he receive a personal emissary from each of them. Not a politician, not a
diplomat—just a messenger. In this day and age, he wondered, what message
cannot be passed through the normal diplomatic channels? They could even use a
hotline that was utterly secure from interception, although interpreters and
technicians did have access.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was intrigued and curious, and as curiosity
was one of his most notable features, he was eager to solve the enigma.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ten minutes later, the two visitors were shown
into the private office of the General Secretary of the CPSU and President of
the Soviet Union. It was a long, narrow room with a row of windows along one
side only, facing out onto New Square. There were no windows behind the
President, who sat with his back to the wall at the end of a long conference
table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In contrast to the gloomy, heavy style
preferred by his two predecessors, Andropov and Chernenko, the younger
Gorbachev preferred a light, airy decor. The desk and table were of light
beech, flanked by upright but comfortable chairs. The windows were masked by
net curtains.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the two men entered, he gestured his
secretaries to leave. He rose from his desk and came forward.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Greetings, gentlemen,” he said in Russian. “Do
either of you speak my language?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One, whom he judged to be English, replied in
halting Russian, “An interpreter would be advisable, Mr. President.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Vitali,” Gorbachev called to one of the
departing secretaries, “send Yevgeny in here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the absence of language, he smiled and
gestured to his visitors to take a seat. His personal interpreter joined them
in seconds and sat to one side of the presidential desk.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“My name, sir, is William Stewart. I am Deputy
Director (Operations) for the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington,” said
the American.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gorbachev’s mouth tightened and his brow
furrowed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And I, sir, am Stephen Laing, Director for
Operations, Mid-East Division, of British Intelligence.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gorbachev’s perplexity deepened. Spies, <i>chekisti</i>—what
on earth was this all about?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Each of our agencies,” said Stewart, “made a
request to its respective government to ask you if you would receive us. The
fact is, sir, the Middle East is moving toward war. We all know this. If it is
to be avoided, we need to know the inner counsels of the Iraqi regime. What
they say in public and what they discuss in private, we believe to be radically
different.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nothing new about that,” observed Gorbachev
dryly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nothing at all, sir. But this is a highly
unstable regime. Dangerous—to us all. If we could only know what the real thinking
inside the cabinet of President Saddam Hussein is today, we might better be
able to plan a strategy to head off the coming war,” said Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Surely that is what diplomats are for,”
Gorbachev pointed out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Normally, yes, Mr. President. But there are times
when even diplomacy is too open, too public a channel for innermost thoughts to
be expressed. You recall the case of Richard Sorge?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gorbachev nodded. Every Russian knew of Sorge.
His face had appeared on postage stamps. He was a posthumous hero of the Soviet
Union.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“At the time,” pursued Laing, “Sorge’s
information that Japan would not attack in Siberia was utterly crucial to your
country. But it could not have come to you via the embassy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The fact is, Mr. President, we have reason to
believe there exists in Baghdad a source, quite exceptionally highly placed,
who is prepared to reveal to us all the innermost counsels of Saddam Hussein.
Such knowledge could mean the difference between war and a voluntary Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mikhail Gorbachev nodded. He was no friend of
Saddam Hussein either. Once a docile client of the USSR, Iraq had become
increasingly independent, and of late its erratic leader had been gratuitously
offensive to the USSR.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Moreover, the Soviet leader was well aware that
if he wanted to carry through his reforms, he would need financial and
industrial support. That meant the goodwill of the West. The cold war was over—that
was a reality. That was why he had joined the USSR in the Security Council
condemnation of Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So, gentlemen, make contact with this source,”
Gorbachev replied. “Produce us information that the powers can use to defuse
this situation, and we will all be grateful. The USSR does not wish to see a
war in the Middle East either.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We would like to make contact, sir,” said
Stewart. “But we cannot. The source declines to disclose himself, and one can
understand why. For him, the risks must be very great. To make contact, we have
to avoid the diplomatic route. He has made plain he will use only covert
communications with us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So what do you ask of me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two Westerners took a deep breath.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We wish to slip a man into Baghdad to act as a
conduit between the source and ourselves,” said Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“An agent?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, Mr. President, an agent. Posing as an
Iraqi.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gorbachev stared at them hard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You have such a man?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, sir. But he must be able to live
somewhere—quietly, discreetly, innocently—while he picks up the messages and
delivers our own inquiries. We ask that he be allowed to pose as an Iraqi on
the staff of a senior member of the Soviet embassy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gorbachev steepled his chin on the tips of his
fingers. He was anything but a stranger to covert operations; his own KGB had
mounted more than a few. Now he was being asked to assist the KGB’s old antagonists
in mounting one, and to lend the Soviet embassy as their man’s umbrella. It was
so outrageous, he almost laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If this man of yours is caught, my embassy
will be compromised.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, sir. Your embassy will have been cynically
duped by Russia’s traditional Western enemies. Saddam will believe that,” said
Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gorbachev thought it over. He recalled the
personal entreaty of one president and one prime minister in this matter. They
evidently held it to be important, and he had no choice but to regard their
goodwill to him as important. Finally he nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well. I will instruct General Vladimir
Kryuchkov to give you his full cooperation.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kryuchkov was, at that time, Chairman of the
KGB. Ten months later, while Gorbachev was on vacation on the Black Sea,
Kryuchkov, with Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov and others, would launch a coup d’état
against their own President.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two Westerners shifted uncomfortably.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“With the greatest respect, Mr. President,”
asked Laing, “could we ask that it be your Foreign Minister and him only in
whom you confide?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eduard Shevardnadze was then Foreign Minister
and a trusted friend of Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Shevardnadze and him alone?” asked the
President.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, sir, if you please.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well. The arrangements will be made only
through the Foreign Ministry.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the Western intelligence officers had
gone, Mikhail Gorbachev sat lost in thought. They had wanted only him and
Eduard to know about this. Not Kryuchkov. Did they, he wondered, know something
that the President of the USSR did not?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>There were eleven Mossad agents in all—two teams of five
and the mission controller, whom Kobi Dror had picked personally, pulling him
off a boring stint as lecturer to the recruits at the training school outside
Herzlia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of the teams was from the yarid branch, a
section of the Mossad concerned with operational security and surveillance. The
other was from neviot, whose speciality is bugging, breaking and entering—in
short, anything where inanimate or mechanical objects are concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eight of the ten had reasonable or good German,
and the mission controller was fluent. The other two were technicians anyway.
The advance group for Operation Joshua slipped into Vienna over three days,
arriving from different European points of departure, each with a perfect
passport and cover story.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As he had with Operation Jericho, Kobi Dror was
bending a few rules, but none of his subordinates were going to argue. Joshua
had been designated <i>ain efes</i>, meaning a no-miss affair, which, coming
from the boss himself, meant top priority.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Yarid and neviot teams normally have seven to
nine members each, but because the target was deemed to be civilian, neutral,
amateur, and unsuspecting, the numbers had been slimmed down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mossad’s Head of Station in Vienna had
allocated three of his safe houses and three <i>bodlim</i> to keep them clean,
tidy, and provisioned at all times.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A <i>bodel</i>, plural <i>bodlim</i>, is
usually a young Israeli, often a student, engaged as a gofer after a thorough
check of his parentage and background. His job is to run errands, perform
chores, and ask no questions. In return he is allowed to live rent-free in a
Mossad safe house, a major benefit for a short-of-money student in a foreign
capital. When visiting “firemen” move in, the <i>bodel</i> has to move out but
can be retained to do the cleaning, laundry, and shopping.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though Vienna may not seem a major capital, for
the world of espionage it has always been very important. The reason goes back
to 1945, when Vienna, as the Third Reich’s second capital, was occupied by the
victorious Allies and divided into four sectors—French, British, American, and
Russian.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Unlike Berlin, Vienna regained her freedom—even
the Russians agreed to move out—but the price was complete neutrality for
Vienna and all Austria. With the cold war getting under way during the Berlin
blockade of 1948, Vienna soon became a hotbed of espionage. Nicely neutral,
with virtually no counterintelligence net of its own, close to the Hungarian
and Czech borders, open to the West but seething with East Europeans, Vienna
was a perfect base for a variety of agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shortly after its formation in 1951, the Mossad
also saw the advantages of Vienna and moved in with such a presence that the
Head of Station outranks the ambassador.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The decision was more than justified when the
elegant and world-weary capital of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire became a
center for ultradiscreet banking, the home of three separate United Nations
agencies, and a favored entry point into Europe for Palestinian and other terrorists.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dedicated to its neutrality, Austria has long
had a counterintelligence and internal security apparatus that is so simple to
evade that Mossad agents refer to these well-intentioned officers as <i>fertsalach</i>,
a not terribly complimentary word meaning a fart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kobi Dror’s chosen mission controller was a
tough <i>katsa</i> with years of European experience behind him in Berlin,
Paris, and Brussels.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gideon Barzilai had also served time in one of
the <i>kidon</i> execution units that had pursued the Arab terrorists responsible
for the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic games.
Fortunately for his own career, he had not been involved in one of the biggest
fiascos in Mossad history, when a <i>kidon</i> unit shot down a harmless
Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, Norway, after wrongly identifying the man as
Ali Hassan Salameh, the brains behind the massacre.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gideon “Gidi” Barzilai was now Ewald Strauss,
representing a manufacturer of bathroom fixtures in Frankfurt. Not only were
his papers in perfect order, but a search of the contents of his briefcase
would have revealed the appropriate brochures, order books, and correspondence
on company stationery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even a phone call to his head office in
Frankfurt would have confirmed his cover story, for the telephone number on the
stationery gave an office in Frankfurt manned by the Mossad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gidi’s paperwork, along with that of the other
ten on his team, was the product of another division of the Mossad’s
comprehensive backup services. In the same subbasement in Tel Aviv that housed
the forgery department is another series of rooms dedicated to storing details
of a truly amazing number of companies, real and fictional. Company records,
audits, registrations, and letterhead stationery are stored in such abundance
that any <i>katsa</i> on a foreign operation can be equipped with a corporate
identity virtually impossible to penetrate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After establishing himself in his own
apartment, Barzilai had an extended conference with the local Head of Station
and began his mission with a relatively simple task: finding out everything he
could about a discreet and ultratraditional private bank called the Winkler Bank,
just off the Franziskanerplatz.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That same weekend, two American Chinook helicopters lifted
into the air from a military base outside Riyadh and headed north to cut into
the Tapline Road that runs along the Saudi-Iraq border from Khafji all the way
to Jordan.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Squeezed inside the hull of each Chinook was a
single long-base Land-Rover, stripped down to basic essentials but equipped
with extralong-range fuel tanks. There were four SAS men traveling with each
vehicle, squeezed into the area behind the flight crews.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Their final destination was beyond their normal
range, but waiting for them on the Tapline Road were two large tankers, driven
up from Dammam on the Gulf coast.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the thirsty Chinooks set down on the road,
the tanker crews went to work until the helicopters were again brimming with
fuel. Taking off, they headed up the road in the direction of Jordan, keeping
low to avoid the Iraqi radar situated across the border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just beyond the Saudi town of Badanah,
approaching the spot where the borders of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Jordan
converge, the Chinooks set down again. There were two more tankers waiting to
refuel them, but it was at this point they unloaded their cargoes and their
passengers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the American aircrew knew where the silent
Englishmen were going, they gave no sign, and if they did not know, they did
not inquire. The loadmasters eased the sand-camouflaged trucks down the ramps
and onto the road, shook hands, and said, “Hey, good luck, you guys.” Then they
refueled and set off back the way they had come. The tankers followed them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The eight SAS men watched them go, then headed
in the other direction, farther up the road toward Jordan. Fifty miles
northwest of Badanah they stopped and waited.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The captain commanding the two-vehicle mission
checked his position. Back in the days of Colonel David Stirling in the Western
Desert of Libya, this had been done by taking bearings of the sun, moon, and
stars. The technology of 1990 made it much easier and more precise.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In his hand the captain held a device the size
of a paperback book. It was called a Global Positioning System, or SATNAV, or
Magellan. Despite its size, the GPS can position its holder to a square no
bigger than ten yards by ten yards anywhere on the earth’s surface.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The captain’s hand-held GPS could be switched
to either the Q-Code or the P-Code. The P-Code was accurate to the
ten-by-ten-yard square, but it needed four of the American satellites called
NAVSTAR to be above the horizon at the same time. The Q-Code needed only two
NAVSTARs above the horizon but was accurate only to a hundred yards by a
hundred.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That day there were only two satellites to
track by, but they were enough. No one was going to miss anyone else a hundred
yards away in that howling wilderness of sand and shale, miles from anywhere
between Badanah and the Jordanian border. Satisfied that he was on the
rendezvous site, the captain switched off the GPS and crawled under the
camouflage nets spread by his men between the two vehicles to shield them from
the sun. The temperature gauge said it was 130 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An hour later, the British Gazelle helicopter
came in from the south. Major Mike Martin had flown from Riyadh in an RAF
Hercules transport to the Saudi town of Al Jawf, the place nearest to the
border at that point that had a municipal airport. The Hercules had carried the
Gazelle with its rotors folded, its pilot, its ground crew, and the extra fuel
tanks needed to get the Gazelle from Al Jawf to the Tapline Road and back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In case of watching Iraqi radar even in this
abandoned place, the Gazelle was skimming the desert, but the pilot quickly saw
the Very starshell fired by the SAS captain when he heard the approaching
engine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Gazelle settled on the road fifty yards
from the Land-Rovers, and Martin climbed out. He carried a kitbag over his
shoulder and a wicker basket in his left hand, the contents of which had caused
the Gazelle pilot to wonder if he had joined the Royal Army Air Corps—or some
branch of the Farmers Union. The basket contained two live hens.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Otherwise, Martin was dressed like the eight
SAS men waiting for him: desert boots, loose trousers of tough canvas, shirt,
sweater, and desert-camouflage combat jacket. Round his neck was a checkered <i>keffiyeh</i>
that could be pulled up to shield his face from the swirling dust, and on his
head a round knitted woolen helmet surmounted by a pair of heavy-duty goggles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pilot wondered why the man did not die of
heat in all that gear, but then, he had never experienced the chill of the
desert night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The SAS men hauled from the rear of the Gazelle
the plastic gasoline cans that had given the little reconnaissance chopper its
maximum all-up weight, and they refilled the tanks. When he was full up again,
the pilot waved good-bye and took off, heading south for Al Jawf, the ride back
to Riyadh, and a return to sanity from these madmen in the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only when he was gone did the SAS men feel at
ease. Though the eight with the Land-Rovers were D Squadron men—light-vehicle
experts—and Martin was an A Squadron freefaller, he knew all but two. With
greetings exchanged, they did what British soldiers do when they have the time:
they brewed up a strong pot of tea.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The point where the captain had chosen to cross
the border into Iraq was wild and bleak for two reasons. The rougher the
country they were running over, the less chance there would be of running into
an Iraqi patrol. His job was not to outpace the Iraqis over open ground but to
escape detection completely.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second reason was that he had to deposit
his charge as near as possible to the long Iraqi highway that snakes its way
from Baghdad westward across the great plains of desert to the Jordanian border
crossing at Ruweishid.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That miserable outpost in the desert had become
very familiar to television viewers after the conquest of Kuwait, because it
was where the hapless tide of refugees—Filipinos, Bengalis, Palestinians, and
others—were wont to cross after fleeing the chaos that the conquest had caused.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In this far northwestern corner of Saudi
Arabia, the distance from the border to the Baghdad road was at its shortest.
The captain knew that to his east, from Baghdad down to the Saudi border, the
land tended to be flat desert, smooth as a billiard table for the most part,
lending itself to a fast run from the border to the nearest road heading for
Baghdad. But it was also likely to be occupied by Army patrols and watching
eyes. Here in the west of Iraq’s deserts, the land was hillier, cut by ravines
that would carry flash floods during the rains and that still had to be
carefully negotiated in the dry season but were virtually empty of Iraqi
patrols.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The chosen crossing point was fifty kilometers
north of where they stood, and beyond the unmarked border only another hundred
to the Baghdad-Ruweishid road. But the captain decided he would need a full
night, a layup under camouflage nets during the next day, and the night after,
in order to deliver his charge to a point within walking distance of the road.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They set off at four in the afternoon. The sun
still blazed, and the heat made driving seem like moving past the door of a
blast furnace. At six the dusk approached, and the air temperature began to
drop—fast. At seven it was completely black, and the chill set in. The sweat
dried on them, and they were grateful for the thick sweaters that the Gazelle
pilot had mocked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the lead vehicle the navigator sat beside
the driver and ran a constant series of checks on their position and course.
Back at their base, he and the captain had spent hours poring over a series of
large-scale, high-definition photographs, kindly provided by an American U-2
mission out of their Taif base, which formed a picture better than a mere map.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were driving without lights, but with a
penlight the navigator kept track of their swerving passage, correcting every
time a gully or defile forced them to divert several kilometers east or west.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Every hour, they stopped to confirm position
with the Magellan. The navigator had already calibrated the sides of his
photographs with minutes and seconds of longitude and latitude, so that the
figures produced by the Magellan’s digital display told them exactly where they
were on the photos.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Progress was slow because at each ridge one of
the men had to run forward and peer over, to ensure that there was no
unpleasant surprise on the other side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An hour before dawn, they found a steep-sided
wadi, drove in, and covered themselves with netting. One of the men withdrew to
a nearby prominence to look down on the camp and order a few adjustments until
he was satisfied a spotter plane would practically have to crash into the wadi
to see them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During the day they ate, drank, and slept, two
always on guard in case of a wandering shepherd or another lonely traveler.
Several times they heard Iraqi jets high overhead, and once the bleating of
goats ranging a nearby hill. But the goats, which seemed to have no herdsman
with them, wandered off in the opposite direction. After sundown they moved on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There is a small Iraqi town called Ar-Rutba
that straddles the highway, and shortly before four <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>A.M.</span> they saw its lights dimly in the distance. The Magellan
confirmed they were where they wanted to be, just south of the town, a
five-mile hike to the road.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Four of the men scouted around until one found
a wadi with a soft, sandy bottom. Here they dug their hole, silently, using the
trenching tools slung on the sides of the Land-Rovers for digging them out of
drifts. They buried the cross-country motorcycle with its reinforced tires, and
the jerrycans of spare fuel to get it to the border, should the need arise. All
were wrapped in tough polyethylene bags to protect against sand and water, for
the rains had still to come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To protect the cache from being washed away,
they erected a cairn of rocks to prevent water erosion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The navigator climbed to the hill above the
wadi and took an exact bearing from the spot to the radio mast above Ar-Rutba,
whose red warning light could be seen in the distance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While they worked, Mike Martin stripped to the
buff and from his kitbag took the robe, headdress, and sandals of Mahmoud
Al-Khouri, the Iraqi laborer and gardener-handyman. With a cloth tote bag
containing bread, oil, cheese, and olives for breakfast, a tattered wallet with
identity card and pictures of Mahmoud’s elderly parents, and a battered tin box
with some money and a penknife, he was ready to go. The Land-Rovers needed an
hour to get clear of the site before turning in for the day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Break a leg,” said the captain,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good hunting, boss,” said the navigator.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“At least you’ll have a fresh egg for
breakfast,” said another, and there was a subdued rumble of laughter. Mike
Martin waved a hand and began to hike across the desert to the road. Minutes
later, the Land-Rovers had gone, and the wadi was empty again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Head of Station in Vienna had on his books a <i>sayan</i>
who was himself in banking, a senior executive with one of the nation’s leading
clearing banks. It was he who was asked to prepare a report, as full as he
could make it, upon the Winkler Bank. The <i>sayan</i> was told only that
certain Israeli enterprises had entered into a relationship with Winkler and
wished to be reassured as to its solidity, antecedents, and banking practices.
There was, he was told regretfully, so much fraud going on these days.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The <i>sayan</i> accepted the reason for the
inquiry and did his best, which was pretty good considering that the first
thing he discovered was that Winkler operated along lines of almost obsessive
secrecy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bank had been founded almost a hundred
years earlier by the father of the present sole owner and president. The
Winkler of 1990 was himself ninety-one and known in Viennese banking circles as
<i>der Alte</i>, “the Old Man.” Despite his age, he refused to relinquish the
presidency or sole controlling interest. Being widowed but childless, there was
no natural family successor, so the eventual disposal of the controlling
interest would have to await the reading of his will.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nevertheless, day-to-day running of the bank
rested with three vice-presidents. Meetings with Old Man Winkler took place
about once a month at his private house, during which his principal concern
seemed to be to ensure that his own stringent standards were being maintained.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Executive decisions were with the
vice-presidents, Kessler, Gemütlich, and Blei. It was not a clearing bank, of
course, had no current account holders, and issued no checkbooks. Its business
was as a depository for clients’ funds, which would be placed in rock-solid, safe
investments, mainly on the European market.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If interest yields from such investments were
never going to enter the top ten performers league, that was not the point.
Winkler’s clients did not seek rapid growth or sky-high interest earnings. They
sought safety and absolute anonymity. This Winkler guaranteed them, and his
bank delivered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The standards on which Old Man Winkler placed
such stress included utter discretion as to the identity of the owners of its
numbered accounts, coupled with a complete avoidance of what the Old Man termed
“new-fangled nonsense.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was this distaste for modern gimmickry that
banned computers for the storage of sensitive information or account control,
fax machines, and where possible, telephones. The Winkler Bank would accept
instructions and information by telephone, but it would never divulge it over a
phone line. Where possible, the Winkler Bank liked to use old-fashioned
letter-writing on its expensive cream linenfold stationery, or personal
meetings within the bank itself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within Vienna the bank messenger would deliver
all letters and statements in wax-sealed envelopes, and only for national and
international letters would the bank trust the public mailing system.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As for numbered accounts owned by foreign
clients—the <i>sayan</i> had been asked to touch upon these—no one knew quite
how many there were, but rumor hinted at deposits of hundreds of millions of
dollars. Clearly, if this was so, and given that a percentage of the secretive
clients would occasionally die without telling anyone else how to operate the
account, the Winkler Bank was doing quite nicely, thank you.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gidi Barzilai, when he read the report, swore
long and loud. Old Man Winkler might know nothing of the latest techniques of
phone-tapping and computer-hacking, but his gut instincts were right on target.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During the years of Iraq’s buildup of her
poison gas technology, every one of the purchases from Germany had been cleared
through one of three Swiss banks. The Mossad knew that the CIA had hacked into
the computers of all three banks—originally the search had been for laundered
drug money—and it was this inside information that had enabled Washington to
file its endless succession of protests to the German government about the
exports. It was hardly the CIA’s fault that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had
contemptuously rejected every one of the protests; the information had been
perfectly accurate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If Gidi Barzilai thought he was going to hack
into the Winkler Bank central computer, he was mistaken; there wasn’t one. That
left room-bugging, mail-interception, and phone-tapping. The chances were, none
of these would solve his problem.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Many bank accounts need a <i>Losungswort</i>, a
coded password, to operate them, to effect withdrawals and transfers. But
account holders can usually use such a password to identify themselves in a
phone call or a fax, as well as in a letter. The way the Winkler Bank seemed to
operate, a high-value numbered account owned by a foreign client such as
Jericho would have had a much more complicated system for its operation; either
a formal appearance with ample identification by the account holder, or a
written mandate prepared in a precise form and manner, with precise coded words
and symbols appearing at precisely the preagreed places.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Clearly, the Winkler Bank would accept an
in-payment from anyone, anytime, anywhere. The Mossad knew that because it had
been paying Jericho his blood money by transfers to an account inside Winkler
that was identified to them by a single number. Persuading the Winkler Bank to
make a transfer out would be a whole different affair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Somehow, from inside the dressing gown where he
spent most of his life listening to church music, Old Man Winkler seemed to
have guessed that illegal information-interception technology would outpace
normal information-transfer techniques. Damn and blast the man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The only other thing the <i>sayan</i> could
vouchsafe was that such high-value numbered accounts would certainly be handled
personally by one of the three vice-presidents and no one else. The Old Man had
chosen his subordinates well: The reputation of all three was that they were
humorless, tough, and well-paid. In a word, impregnable. Israel, the <i>sayan</i>
had added, need have no worries about the Winkler Bank. He had, of course,
missed the point. Gidi Barzilai, that first week of November, was already
getting extremely fed up with the Winkler Bank.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>There was a bus an hour after dawn, and it slowed for the
single passenger sitting on a rock by the road three miles short of Ar-Rutba
when he got up and waved. He handed over two grubby dinar notes, took a seat in
the back, balanced his basket of chickens on his lap, and fell asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a police patrol in the center of the
town, where the bus jolted to a halt on its old springs and a number of passengers
got off to go to work or to the market, while others got on. But while the
police checked the ID cards of those getting on, they contented themselves with
glancing through the dusty windows at the few who remained inside and ignored
the peasant with his chickens in back. They were looking for subversives,
suspicious characters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After a further hour, the bus rumbled on to the
east, rocking and swaying, occasionally pulling onto the hard shoulder as a
column of Army vehicles roared past, their stubbled conscripts sitting morosely
in the back, staring at the swirling dust clouds they raised.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With his eyes closed, Mike Martin listened to
the chatter around him, latching on to an unaccustomed word or a hint of accent
that he might have forgotten. The Arabic of this part of Iraq was markedly
different from that of Kuwait. If he were to pass for an ill-educated and
harmless <i>fellagha</i> in Baghdad, these out-of-town provincial accents and
phrases would prove useful. Few things disarm a city cop more quickly than a hayseed
accent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The hens in their cage on his lap had had a
rough ride, even though he had scattered corn from his pocket and shared the
water from his flask, now inside a Land-Rover baking under netting in the
desert behind him. With each lurch the birds clucked in protest or squatted and
crapped into the litter beneath them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It would have taken a keen eye to observe that
the base of the cage on its external measurement was four inches more than on
the inside. The deep litter around the hens’ feet hid the difference. The
litter was only an inch deep. Inside the four-inch-deep cavity beneath the
twenty-by-twenty-inch cage were a number of items that those police at Ar-Rutba
would have found puzzling but interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One was a fold-away satellite dish, turned into
a stumpy rod like a collapsible umbrella. Another was a transceiver, more
powerful than that Martin had used in Kuwait. Baghdad would not offer the
facility of being able to broadcast while wandering around the desert. Lengthy
transmissions would be out, which accounted, apart from the rechargeable
cadmium-silver battery, for the last item in the cavity. It was a tape
recorder, but a rather special one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>New technology tends to start large,
cumbersome, and difficult to use. As it develops, two things happen. The
innards become more and more complicated, although smaller and smaller, and the
operation becomes simpler.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The radio sets hauled into France by agents for
the British Special Operations Executive during the Second World War were a
nightmare by modern standards. Occupying a suitcase, they needed an aerial
strung for yards up a drainpipe, had cumbersome valves the size of light bulbs,
and could only transmit messages on a Morse-sender. This kept the operator
tapping for ages, while German detector units could triangulate on the source
and close in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin’s tape recorder was simple to operate
but also carried some useful features inside. A ten-minute message could be
read slowly and clearly into the mouthpiece. Before it was recorded on the
spool, a silicon chip would encrypt it into a garble that, even if intercepted,
the Iraqis could probably not decode.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the push of a button, the tape would rewind.
Another button would cause it to rerecord, but at one two-hundredth of the
speed, reducing the message to a three-second burst that would be just about
impossible to trace.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was this burst that the transmitter would
send out when linked to the satellite dish, the battery, and the tape recorder.
In Riyadh the message would be caught, slowed down, decrypted, and replayed in
clear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin left the bus at Ramadi, where it
stopped, and took another one on past Lake Habbaniyah and the old Royal Air
Force base, now converted to a modern Iraqi fighter station. The bus was
stopped at the outskirts of Baghdad, and all identity cards were checked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin stood humbly in the line, clutching his
chickens, as the passengers approached the table where the police sergeant sat.
When it was his turn, he set the wicker basket on the floor and produced his ID
card. The sergeant glanced at it. He was hot and thirsty. It had been a long
day. He gestured to the place of origin of the card-bearer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where is this?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It is a small village north of Baji. Well
known for its melons, <i>bey</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sergeant’s mouth twitched. <i>Bey</i> was a
respectful form of address that dated back to the Turkish empire, only
occasionally heard, and then only from people out of the real backwoods. He
flicked a dismissive hand; Martin picked up his chickens and went back to the
bus.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shortly before seven, the bus rolled to a stop
and Major Martin stepped out into the main bus station in Kadhimiya, Baghdad.</p>

<b><i><span style='font-size:22.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'><br

<h1><a name="_Toc6942762">Chapter 11</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was a long walk through the early evening from the bus
station in the north of the city to the house of the Soviet First Secretary in
the district of Mansour, but Martin welcomed it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For one thing, he had been cooped up in two
separate buses for twelve hours, covering the 240 miles from Ar-Rutba to the
capital, and they had not been luxury coaches. For another, the walk gave him
the chance to inhale once again the feel of the city he had not seen since
leaving on an airliner for London as a very nervous schoolboy of thirteen, and
that had been twenty-four years earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Much had changed. The city he remembered had
been very much an Arab city, much smaller, grouped around the central districts
of Shaikh Omar and Saadun on the northwestern bank of the Tigris in Risafa, and
the district of Aalam across the river in Karch. Within this inner city was
where most of life had been; here narrow streets, alleys, markets, mosques, and
their minarets had dominated the skyline to remind the people of their
subservience to Allah.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Twenty years of oil revenue had brought long
divided highways plunging through the once-open spaces, with rotaries,
overpasses, and cloverleaf intersections. Cars had proliferated, and
skyscrapers pushed upward into the night sky, Mammon nudging his old adversary.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mansour, when he reached it down the long
stretch of Rabia Street, was hardly recognizable. He recalled wide open spaces
around the Mansour Club where his father had taken the family on weekend
afternoons. Mansour was still clearly an upscale suburb, but the open spaces
had been filled with streets and residences for those who could afford to live
in style.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He passed within a few hundred yards of Mr.
Hartley’s old preparatory school, where he had learned his lessons and played
during the breaks with his friends Hassan Rahmani and Abdelkarim Badri, but in
the darkness he did not recognize the street.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He knew just what job Hassan was doing now, but
of Dr Badri’s two sons he had heard no word in almost a quarter of a century.
Had the little one, Osman, with his taste for mathematics, ever become an
engineer after all? he wondered. And Abdelkarim, who had won prizes for
reciting English poetry—had he in turn become a poet or a writer?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If Martin had marched in the manner of the SAS,
heel-and-toe, shoulders swinging to assist his moving legs, he could have
covered the distance in half the time. He could also have been reminded, like
those two engineers in Kuwait, that “you may dress like an Arab, but you still
walk like an Englishman.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But his shoes were not laced marching boots.
They were canvas slippers with rope soles, the footwear of a poor Iraqi <i>fellagha</i>,
so he shuffled along with bowed shoulders and head down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In Riyadh they had shown him an up-to-date map
of the city of Baghdad, and many photographs taken from high altitude but
magnified until, with a magnifying glass, one could look into the gardens
behind the walls, picking out the swimming pools and cars of the wealthy and
powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All these he had memorized. He turned left into
Jordan Street and just past Yarmuk Square took a right into the tree-lined
avenue where the Soviet diplomat lived.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the sixties, under Kassem and the generals
who followed him, the USSR had occupied a favored and prestigious position in
Baghdad, pretending to espouse Arab nationalism because it was seen to be
anti-Western, while trying to convert the Arab world to Communism. In those
years the Soviet embassy had purchased several large residences outside its
main compound, which could not accommodate the swelling staff, and as a
concession these residences and their grounds had been accorded the status of
Soviet territory. It was a privilege even Saddam Hussein had never gotten
around to rescinding, the more so as until the mid-eighties his principal arms
supplier had been Moscow, and six thousand Soviet military advisers had trained
his Air Force and Armored Corps with their Russian equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin found the villa and identified it from
the small brass plaque that announced this was a residence belonging to the
embassy of the USSR. He pulled on the chain beside the gate and waited.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After several minutes the gate opened to reveal
a burly, crop-haired Russian in the white tunic of a steward.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Da</i>?” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin replied in Arabic, the wheedling whine
of a supplicant who speaks to a superior. The Russian scowled. Martin fumbled
inside his robe and produced his identity card. This made sense to the steward;
in his country they knew about internal passports. He took the card, said, “Wait,”
in Arabic, and closed the gate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was back in five minutes, beckoning the
Iraqi in the soiled <i>dish-dash</i> through the gate into the forecourt. He
led Martin toward the steps leading to the main door of the villa. As they
reached the bottom of the steps a man appeared at the top.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That will do. I will handle this,” he said in
Russian to the manservant, who glowered at the Arab one last time and went back
into the house.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Yuri Kulikov, First Secretary to the Soviet
embassy, was a wholly professional diplomat who had found the order he received
from Moscow outrageous but unavoidable. He had evidently been caught at dinner,
for he clutched a napkin with which he dabbed his lips as he descended the
steps.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So here you are,” he said in Russian. “Now
listen, if we have to go through with this charade, so be it. But I personally
will have nothing to do with it. <i>Panimayesh</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin, who did not speak Russian, shrugged
helplessly and said in Arabic:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Please, <i>bey</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kulikov took the change of language as dumb
insolence. Martin realized with a delicious irony that the Soviet diplomat
really thought his unwelcome new staff member was a fellow-Russian who had been
sicced onto him by those wretched spooks up at the Lubyanka in Moscow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, very well then, Arabic if you wish,” he
said testily. He too had trained in Arabic, which he spoke well with a harsh
Russian accent. He was damned if he was going to be shown up by this agent of
the KGB.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So he continued in Arabic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Here is your card. Here is the letter I was
ordered to prepare for you. Now, you will live in the shack at the far end of
the garden, keep the grounds in order, and do the shopping as the chef
instructs. Apart from that, I do not want to know. If you are caught, I know
nothing except that I took you on in good faith. Now, go about your business
and get rid of those damned hens. I will not have chickens ruining the garden.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Some chance, he thought bitterly as he turned
back to resume his interrupted dinner. If the oaf is caught up to some
mischief, the AMAM will soon know he is a Russian, and the idea that he is on
the First Secretary’s personal staff by accident will be as likely as a skating
party on the Tigris. Yuri Kulikov was privately furious with Moscow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin found his quarters up against the
rear wall of the quarter-acre garden, a one-room bungalow with a cot, a table,
two chairs, a row of hooks on one wall, and a washbasin set in a shelf in a
corner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Further examination revealed an earth-closet
close by and a cold-water tap in the garden wall. Hygiene would clearly be
pretty basic and food presumably served from the kitchen door at the rear of
the villa. He sighed. The house outside Riyadh seemed a long way away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He found a number of candles and some matches.
By their dim light, he slung blankets across the windows and went to work on
the rough tiles of the floor with his penknife. An hour of scratching at the
moldy mortar brought four of the tiles up, and a further hour of digging with <i>a.
</i>trowel from the nearby potting shed produced a hole to take his radio
transmitter, batteries, tape recorder, and satellite dish. A mixture of mud and
spittle rubbed into the cracks between the tiles hid the last traces of his
excavation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just before midnight, he used his knife to cut
away the false bottom of the chicken cage and set the litter into the real
base, so that no trace remained of the four-inch cavity. While he worked the
chickens scratched around the floor, looking hopefully for a nonexistent grain
of wheat but finding and consuming several bugs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin finished off the last of his olives and
cheese and shared the remaining fragments of pita bread with his traveling
companions, along with a bowl of water drawn from the outside tap.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The hens went back into their cage, and if they
found their home now four inches deeper than it used to be, they made no
complaint. It had been a long day, and they went to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In a last gesture, Martin peed all over Kulikov’s
roses in the darkness before blowing out the candles, wrapping himself in his
blanket, and doing the same.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His body clock caused him to wake up at four <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> Extracting the transmitting gear in its
plastic bags, he recorded a brief message for Riyadh, speeded it up by two
hundred times, connected the tape recorder to the transmitter, and erected the
satellite dish, which occupied much of the center of the shack but pointed out
the open door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At four forty-five <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>
he sent a single-burst transmission on the channel of the day, then dismantled
it all and put it back under the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sky was still pitch-black over Riyadh when
a similar dish on the roof of the SIS residence caught the one-second signal
and fed it down to the communications room. The transmitting time “window” was
from four-thirty until five <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>, and the
listening watch was awake.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two spinning tapes caught the burst from
Baghdad, and a warning light flashed to alert the technicians. They slowed the
message down by two hundred times until it came over the headphones in clear.
One noted it down in shorthand, typed it up, and left the room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Julian Gray, the Head of Station, was shaken
awake at five fifteen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s Black Bear, sir. He’s in.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gray read the transcript with mounting
excitement and went to wake Simon Paxman. The head of the Iraq Desk was now on
extended assignment to Riyadh, his duties in London having been taken over by
his subordinate. He too sat up, wide awake, and read it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody hell, so far so good.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The problem could start,” said Gray, “when he
tries to raise Jericho.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a sobering thought. The former Mossad
asset in Baghdad had been switched off for three full months. He might have
been compromised or caught, or simply changed his mind. He could have been
posted far away, especially if he turned out to be a general now commanding
troops in Kuwait. Anything could have happened. Paxman stood up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Better tell London. Any chance of coffee?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll tell Mohammed to get it together,” said
Gray.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin was watering the flowerbeds at five-thirty,
when the house began to stir. The cook, a bosomy Russian woman, saw him from
her window and, when water was hot, called him over to the kitchen window.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Kak mazyvaetes</i>?” she asked, then
thought for a moment and used the Arabic word: “Name?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mahmoud,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, here’s a cup of coffee, Mahmoud.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin bobbed his head several times in
delighted acceptance, muttering “<i>shukran</i>” and taking the hot mug in two
hands. He was not joking; it was delicious real coffee and his first hot drink
since the tea on the Saudi side of the border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Breakfast was at seven, a bowl of lentils and
pita bread, which he devoured. It appeared that the houseman of the previous
evening and his wife, the cook, looked after First Secretary Kulikov, who
seemed to be single. By eight, Martin had met the chauffeur, an Iraqi who spoke
a smattering of Russian and would be useful translating simple messages to the
Russians.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin decided not to get too close to the
chauffeur, who might be a plant by the AMAM Secret Police or even Rahmani’s counterintelligence
people. That turned out to be no problem; agent or not, the chauffeur was a
snob and treated the new gardener with contempt. He agreed, however, to explain
to the cook that Martin had to leave for a while because their employer had ordered
him to get rid of his chickens.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Back on the street, Martin headed for the bus
station, liberating his hens onto a patch of waste ground on the way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As in so many Arab cities, the bus station in
Baghdad is not simply a place for boarding vehicles leaving for the provinces.
It is a seething maelstrom of working-class humanity where people have things
to buy and sell. Running along the south wall is a useful flea market. It was
here that Martin, after the appropriate haggle, bought a rickety bicycle that squeaked
piteously when he rode it but was soon grateful for a shot of oil.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had known he could not get around in a car,
and even a motorcycle would be too grand for a humble gardener. He recalled his
father’s houseman pedaling through the city from market to market, buying the
daily provisions, and from what he could see, a bicycle was still a perfectly
normal way for working people to get around.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A little work with the penknife sawed off the
top of the chicken cage, converting it into an open-topped square basket, which
he secured to the rear pillion of the bicycle with two stout rubber cords,
former car fan belts, that he bought from a back-street garage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He bicycled back into the city center and
bought four different-colored sticks of chalk from a stationer in Shurja
Street, just across from St. Joseph’s Catholic Church, where the Chaldean
Christians meet to worship.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He recalled the area from his boyhood, the Agid
al Nasara, or Area of the Christians, and Shurja and Bank streets were still
full of illegally parked cars and foreigners prowling through the shops selling
herbs and spices.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he was a boy, there had only been three
bridges across the Tigris: the Railway Bridge in the north, the New Bridge in
the middle, and the King Faisal Bridge in the south. Now there were nine. Four
days after the start of the air war still to come, there would be none, for all
had been targeted inside the Black Hole in Riyadh, and destroyed they duly
were. But that first week of November, the life of the city flowed across them
ceaselessly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other thing he noticed was the presence
everywhere of the AMAM Secret Police, though most of them made no attempt to be
secret. They watched on street corners and from parked cars. Twice he saw
foreigners stopped and required to produce their identity cards, and twice saw
the same thing happen to Iraqis. The demeanor of the foreigners was of resigned
irritation, but that of the Iraqis was of visible fear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the surface the city life went on, and the
people of Baghdad were as good-humored as he recalled them; but his antennae
told him that beneath the surface, the river of fear imposed by the tyrant in
the great palace down by the river near the Tammuz Bridge ran strong and deep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only once that morning did he come across a
hint of what many Iraqis felt every day of their lives. He was in the fruit and
vegetable market at Kasra, still across the river from his new home, haggling
over the price of some fresh fruit with an old stallholder. If the Russians
were going to feed him lentils and bread, he could at least back up this diet
with some fruit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nearby, four AMAM men frisked a youth roughly
before sending him on his way. The old fruit seller hawked and spat in the
dust, narrowly missing one of his own eggplants.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“One day the Beni Naji will come back and chase
this filth away,” he muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Careful, old man, these are foolish words,”
whispered Martin, testing some peaches for ripeness. The old man stared at him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where are you from, brother?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Far away. A village in the north, beyond Baji.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Go back there, if you take an old man’s
advice. I have seen much. The Beni Naji will come from the sky—aye, and the
Beni el Kalb.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He spat again, and this time the eggplants were
not so fortunate. Martin made his purchase of peaches and lemons and pedaled
away. He was back at the house of the Soviet First Secretary by noon. Kulikov
was long gone to the embassy and his driver with him, so though Martin was
rebuked by the cook, it was in Russian, so he shrugged and got on with the
garden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But he was intrigued by what the old
greengrocer had said. Some, it seemed, could foresee their own invasion and did
not oppose it. The phrase “chase this filth away” could only refer to the
Secret Police and, by inference, to Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the streets of Baghdad, the British are
referred to as the Beni Naji. Exactly who Naji was remains lost in the mists of
time, but it is believed he was a wise and holy man. Young British officers
posted in those parts under the empire used to come to see him, to sit at his
feet and listen to his wisdom. He treated them like his sons, even though they
were Christians and therefore infidel, so people called them the “Sons of Naji.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Americans are referred to as the Beni el
Kalb. <i>Kalb</i> in Arabic is a dog, and the dog, alas, is not a highly
regarded creature in Arab culture.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Gideon Barzilai could at least take one comfort from the
report on the Winkler Bank provided by the embassy’s banking <i>sayan</i>. It
showed him the direction he had to take.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His first priority had to be to identify which
of the three vice-presidents, Kessler, Gemütlich, or Blei, was the one who
controlled the account owned by the Iraqi renegade Jericho.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fastest route would be by a phone call, but
judging from the report, Barzilai was sure none of them would admit anything
over an open line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He made his request by heavily encoded signal
from the fortified underground Mossad station beneath the Vienna embassy and
received his reply from Tel Aviv as fast as it could be prepared.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a letter, forged on genuine letterhead
extracted from one of Britain’s oldest and most reputable banks, Coutts of The
Strand, London, bankers to Her Majesty the Queen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The signature was even a perfect facsimile of
the autograph of a genuine senior officer of Coutts, in the overseas section.
There was no addressee by name, either on the envelope or the letter, which
began simply, “Dear Sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The text of the letter was simple and to the
point. An important client of Coutts would soon be making a substantial
transfer into the numbered account of a client of the Winkler Bank—to wit,
account number so-and-so. Coutts’s client had now alerted them that due to
unavoidable technical reasons, there would be a delay of several days in the
effecting of the transfer. Should Winkler’s client inquire as to its nonarrival
on time, Coutts would be eternally grateful if Messrs. Winkler could inform
their client that the transfer was indeed on its way and would arrive without a
moment’s unnecessary delay. Finally, Coutts would much appreciate an
acknowledgment of the safe arrival of their missive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barzilai calculated that as banks love the
prospect of incoming money, and few more than Winkler, the staid old bank in
the Ballgasse would give the bankers of the Royal House of Windsor the courtesy
of a reply—by letter. He was right.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Coutts envelope from Tel Aviv matched the
stationery and was stamped with British stamps, apparently postmarked at the
Trafalgar Square post office two days earlier. It was addressed simply to “Director,
Overseas Client Accounts, Winkler Bank.” There was, of course, no such position
within the Winkler Bank, since the job was divided among three men.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The envelope was delivered, in the dead of
night, by being slipped through the mail slot of the bank in Vienna.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The yarid surveillance team had been watching
the bank for a week by that time, noting and photographing its daily routine,
its hours of opening and closing, the arrival of the mail, the departure of the
messenger on his rounds, the positioning of the receptionist behind her desk in
the ground-floor lobby, and the positioning of the security guard at a smaller
desk opposite her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Winkler Bank did not occupy a new building.
Ballgasse—and indeed, the whole of the Franziskanerplatz area—lies in the old
district just off Singerstrasse. The bank building must once have been the
Vienna dwelling of a rich merchant family, solid and substantial, secluded
behind a heavy wooden door adorned with a discreet brass plaque. To judge from
the layout of a similar house on the square which the yarid team had examined
while posing as clients of the accountant who dwelt there, it had only five
floors, with about six offices per floor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Among their observations, the yarid team had
noted that the outgoing mail was taken each evening, just before the hour of
closing, to a mailbox on the square. This was a chore performed by the
commissionaire or guard, who then returned to the building to hold the door
open while the staff trooped out. Finally he let in the nightwatchman before
going home himself. It was the nightwatchman who shut himself in, slamming
enough bolts across the wooden door to keep out an armored car.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before the envelope from Coutts of London was
dropped through the bank’s door, the head of the neviot technical team had
examined the mailbox on Franziskanerplatz and snorted with disgust. It was
hardly a challenge. One of his team was a crack lockpick and had the mailbox
open and reclosed inside three minutes. From what he learned the first time he
did it, he could make up a key to fit, which he did. After a couple of minor
adjustments, it worked as well as the postman’s key.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Further surveillance revealed that the bank
guard always dropped off the bank’s outgoing mail between twenty and thirty
minutes ahead of the regular six <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span>
pickup from the mailbox by the official post office van.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The day the Coutts letter went into the mail
slot in the door, the yarid team and the neviot lockpick worked together. As
the bank guard returned to the bank down the alley after making the dropoff
that evening, the lockpick had the door of the mailbox open. The twenty-two
letters going out from the Winkler Bank lay on top. It took thirty seconds to
abstract the one addressed to Messrs. Coutts of London, replace the rest, and
relock the box.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All five of the yarid team had been posted in
the square in case anyone tried to interfere with the “postman,” whose uniform,
hurriedly purchased in a secondhand shop, bore a marked resemblance to the real
uniforms of Viennese mailmen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the good citizens of Vienna are not accustomed
to agents from the Middle East breaking the sanctity of a mailbox. There were
only two people in the square at the time, and neither took any notice of what
appeared to be a post office employee going about his lawful business. Twenty
minutes later, the real postman did his job, but by then the passersby were
gone and replaced with fresh ones.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barzilai opened Winkler’s reply to Coutts and
noted that it was a brief but courteous reply of acknowledgment, written in
passable English, and signed by Wolfgang Gemütlich. The Mossad team leader now
knew exactly who handled the Jericho account. All that remained was to break
him or penetrate him. What Barzilai did not know was that his problems were
just beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was well after dark when Mike Martin left the compound
in Mansour. He saw no reason to disturb the Russians by going out through the
main gate; there was a much smaller wicket gate in the rear wall, with a rusty
lock to which he had been given the key. He wheeled his bicycle out into the
alley, relocked the gate, and began to pedal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It would be, he knew, a long night. The Chilean
diplomat Moncada had described perfectly well to the Mossad officers who
debriefed him when he came out just where he had sited the three dead-letter
boxes destined for messages from him to Jericho and where to put the chalk
marks to alert the invisible Jericho that a message awaited him. Martin felt he
had no choice but to use all three at once, with an identical message in each.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had written out those messages in Arabic on
flimsy airmail paper and folded each one into a square glassine bag. The three
bags were taped to his inner thigh. The chalk sticks resided in a side pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first drop was the Alwazia cemetery, across
the river in Risafa. He knew it already, remembered from long ago and studied
at length on photographs in Riyadh. Finding the loose brick in darkness was
another matter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took ten minutes, scrabbling with fingertips
in the darkness of the walled cemetery compound, before he found the right one.
But it was just where Moncada had said. He eased the brick from its niche,
slipped one glassine bag behind it, and replaced the brick.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His second drop was in another old and
crumbling wall, this time near the ruined citadel in Aadhamiya, where a
stagnant pond is all that remains of the ancient moat. Not far from the citadel
is the Imam Aladham shrine, and between them a wall, as old and crumbled as the
citadel itself. Martin found the wall and the single tree growing against it.
He reached behind the tree and counted ten rows of bricks down from the top.
The tenth brick down rocked like an old tooth. The second envelope went behind
it, and the brick went back. Martin checked to see if anyone was watching, but
he was completely alone; no one would want to come to this deserted place after
dark.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The third and last drop was in another
cemetery, but this time the British one, long abandoned, in Waziraya, near the
Turkish embassy. As in Kuwait, it was a grave, but not a scrape beneath the
marble of the tomb; rather, it was the inside of a small stone jar cemented
where the headstone would be, at one end of a long-abandoned plot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Never mind,” murmured Martin to whatever
long-dead warrior of the empire lay beneath. “Just carry on, you’re doing fine.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because Moncada had been based at the United
Nations building, miles down the Matar Sadam Airport road, he had wisely made
his chalk-mark sites closer to the wider-spaced roads of Mansour, where they
could be seen from a passing car. The rule was that whoever—Moncada or Jericho—saw
a chalk mark, he should note which drop it referred to, then erase it with a
damp cloth. The placer of the mark, passing a day or so later, would see that
it was gone and know his message had been received and (presumably) the drop
visited and the package retrieved.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In this way both agents had communicated with
each other for two years and never met.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin, unlike Moncada, had no car, so he
cycled the whole distance. His first mark, a Saint Andrew’s cross in the figure
of an X, was made with blue chalk on a stone post of the gate of an abandoned
mansion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second was in white chalk, on the rusty-red
sheet-iron door of a garage at the back of a house in Yarmuk. It took the form
of a cross of Lorraine. The third was in red chalk—a crescent of Islam with a
horizontal bar through the middle—placed on the wall of the compound building
of the Union of Arab Journalists, on the edge of Mutanabi district. Iraqi
journalists are not encouraged to be a very investigative crowd, and a chalk
mark on their wall would hardly make headlines.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin could not know whether Jericho, despite
Moncada’s warning that he could return, was still patrolling the city, peering
from his car window to see if marks had been placed on walls. All Martin could
now do was check daily and wait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was the seventh of November when he noticed
that the white chalk mark was gone. Had the garage door owner decided to clean
up his sheet of rusty metal of his own accord?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin cycled on. The blue chalk on the mansion
gatepost was missing; so was the red mark on the journalists’ wall.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, he serviced the three dead-letter
boxes dedicated to messages from Jericho to his controller.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One was behind a loose brick in the rear of the
wall enclosing the Kasra vegetable market off Saadun Street. There was a folded
sheet of onionskin paper for him. The second drop, under the loose stone
windowsill of a derelict house up an alley in that maze of tacky streets that
make up the <i>soukh</i> on the north bank of the river near Shuhada Bridge,
yielded the same offering. The third and last, under the loose flagstone of an
abandoned courtyard off Abu Nawas Street, gave up a third square of thin paper.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin hid them under sticky tape around his
left thigh and pedaled home to Mansour.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the light of a flickering candle, he read
them all. The message was the same: Jericho was alive and well. He was prepared
to work again for the West, and he understood that the British and Americans
were now the recipients of his information. But the risks had now increased immeasurably,
and so would his fees. He awaited agreement to this and an indication of what
was wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin burned all three messages and crushed
the ashes to powder. He already knew the answer to both queries. Langley was
prepared to be generous, really generous, if the product was good. As for the
information needed, Martin had memorized a list of questions concerning Saddam’s
mood, his concept of strategy, and the locations of major command centers and
sites of manufacture for weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just before dawn, he let Riyadh know that
Jericho was back in the game.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was on November 10 that Dr. Terry Martin returned to
his small and cluttered office in the School of Oriental and African Studies to
find a scrap of paper from his secretary placed foursquare on his blotter:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A Mr. Plummer called; said you had his number
and would know what it was about.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The abruptness of the text indicated that Miss
Wordsworth was miffed. She was a lady who liked to protect her academic charges
with the possessive wraparound security of a mother hen. Clearly, this meant
knowing what was going on at all times. Callers who declined to tell her why
they were phoning or what the matter concerned did not meet with her approval.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With the autumn term in full swing and a whole
cast of new students to cope with, Terry Martin had almost forgotten his
request to the Director of the Arabic Services at Government Communications
Headquarters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When Martin called, Plummer was out at lunch;
then afternoon lectures kept him busy until four. His connection with
Gloucestershire found its target just before he went home at five.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah, yes,” said Plummer. “You recall you asked
for anything odd, anything that did not make sense? We picked up something
yesterday at our outstation in Cyprus that seems to be a bit of a stinker. You
can listen to it, if you like.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Here in London?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah, no, afraid not. It’s on tape here, of
course, but frankly you’d need to hear it on the big machine, with all the
enhancement we can get. A simple tape player wouldn’t have the quality. It’s
rather muffled; that’s why even my Arab staff can’t work it out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The rest of the week was fully booked for both
of them. Martin agreed to drive over on Sunday, and Plummer offered to stand
him lunch at a “quite decent little pub about a mile from the office.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two men in tweed jackets caused no raised
eyebrows in the beamed hostelry, and each ordered the Sunday-roast dish of the
day, beef and Yorkshire pudding.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We don’t know who is talking to whom,” said
Plummer, “but clearly they are pretty senior men. For some reason the caller is
using an open telephone line and appears to have returned from a visit to
forward headquarters in Kuwait. Perhaps he was using his car phone; we know it
wasn’t on a military net, so probably the person being spoken to was not a
military man. Senior bureaucrat, perhaps.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The beef arrived, and they ceased talking while
it was served with roast potatoes and parsnips. When the waitress left their
corner booth, Plummer went on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The caller seems to be commenting on Iraqi Air
Force reports that the Americans and Brits are flying an increasing number of
aggressive fighter patrols right up to the Iraqi border, then veering away at
the last minute.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin nodded. He had heard of the tactic. It
was designed to monitor Iraqi air-defense reactions to such seeming attacks on
their air space, forcing them to “illuminate” their radar screens and SAM
missile sights, thus revealing their exact positions to the watching AWACS
circling out over the Gulf.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The speaker refers to the Beni el Kalb, ‘the
sons of dogs,’ meaning the Americans, and the listener laughs and suggests Iraq
is wrong to respond to these tactics, which are evidently meant to trap them
into revealing their defensive positions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then the speaker says something that we can’t
work out. There’s some garbling at this point, static or something. We can
enhance most of the message to clear the interference, but the speaker muffles
his words at this point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Anyway, the listener gets very annoyed and
tells him to shut up and get off the line. Indeed, the listener—who we believe
to be in Baghdad—slams the phone down. It’s the last two sentences I’d like you
to hear.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After lunch, Plummer drove Martin over to the
monitoring complex, which was still functioning precisely as on a weekday. GCHQ
operates on a seven-days-per-week schedule. In a soundproofed room rather like
a recording studio, Plummer asked one of the technicians to play the mystery
tape. He and Martin sat in silence as the guttural voices from Iraq filled the
room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The conversation began as Plummer had
described. Toward the end, the Iraqi who had initiated the call appeared to
become excited. The voice pitch rose.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Not for long, Rafeek. Soon we shall </i>...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then the clutter began, and the words were
garbled. But their effect on the man in Baghdad was electric. He cut in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Be silent, ibn-al-gahba</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then he slammed the phone down, as if suddenly
and horribly aware that the line was not secure.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The technician played the tape three times and
at slightly different speeds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you think?” asked Plummer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, they’re both members of the Party,” said
Martin. “Only Party hierarchs use the address <i>Rafeek</i>, or Comrade.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Right, so we have two bigwigs chatting about
the American arms buildup and the U.S. Air Force provocations against the
border.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then the speaker gets excited, probably angry,
with a hint of exultation. Uses the phrase ‘not for long.’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Indicating some changes are going to be made?”
asked Plummer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sounds like it,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then the garbled bit. But look at the listener’s
reaction, Terry. He not only slams the phone down, he calls his colleague ‘son
of a whore.’ That’s pretty strong stuff, eh?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very strong. Only the senior man of the two
could use that phrase and get away with it,” said Martin. “What the hell
provoked it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s the garbled phrase. Listen again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The technician played the single phrase again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Something about Allah?” suggested Plummer. “ ‘Soon
we shall be with Allah? Be in the hands of Allah?’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It sounds to me like: ‘Soon we shall have ...
something ... something ... Allah.’</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, Terry. I’ll go along with that. ‘Have
the help of Allah,’ perhaps?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then why would the other man explode in rage?”
asked Martin. “Attributing the goodwill of the Almighty to one’s own cause is
nothing new. Nor particularly offensive. I don’t know. Can you let me have a
duplicate tape to take home with me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sure.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Have you asked our American cousins about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course. Fort Meade caught the same
conversation, off a satellite. They can’t work it out, either. In fact, they
don’t rate it highly. For them it’s on the back burner.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin drove home with the small cassette
tape in his pocket. To Hilary’s considerable annoyance, he insisted on playing
and replaying the brief conversation over and over again on their bedside
cassette player. When he protested, Terry pointed out that Hilary sometimes
worried and worried over a single missing answer in the <i>Times</i> crossword
puzzle. Hilary was outraged at the comparison.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“At least I get the answer the following
morning,” he snapped, and rolled over and went to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin did not get the answer the
following morning, or the next. He played his tape during breaks between
lectures, and at other times when he had a few spare moments, jotting down
possible alternatives for the jumbled words. But always the sense eluded him.
Why had the other man in that conversation been so angry about a harmless
reference to Allah?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not until five days later that the two
gutturals and the sibilant contained in the garbled phrase made sense.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they did, he tried to get hold of Simon
Paxman at Century House, but he was told his contact was away until further
notice. He asked to be put through to Steve Laing, but the head of Ops for the
Mid-East was also not available.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though he could not know it, Paxman was on an
extended stay at the SIS headquarters in Riyadh, and Laing was visiting the
same city for a major conference with Chip Barber of the CIA.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The man they called the “spotter” flew into Vienna from
Tel Aviv via London and Frankfurt, was met by no one, and took a taxi from
Schwechat Airport to the Sheraton Hotel, where he had a reservation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The spotter was rubicund and jovial, an
all-American lawyer from New York with documents to prove it. His
American-accented English was flawless—not surprising, as he had spent years in
the United States—and his German passable.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within hours of arriving in Vienna, he had
employed the secretarial services of the Sheraton to compose and draft a courteous
letter on his law firm’s letterhead to a certain Wolfgang Gemütlich,
vice-president of the Winkler Bank.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The stationery was perfectly genuine, and
should a phone check be made, the signatory really was a senior partner at that
most prestigious New York law firm, although he was away on vacation (something
the Mossad had checked out in New York) and was certainly not the same man as
the visitor to Vienna.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The letter was both apologetic and intriguing,
as it was meant to be. The writer represented a client of great wealth and
standing who now wished to make substantial lodgements of his fortune in
Europe.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was the client who had personally insisted,
apparently after hearing from a friend, that the Winkler Bank be approached in
the matter, and specifically the person of the good Herr Gemütlich.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The writer would have made a prior appointment,
but both his client and the law firm placed immense importance upon utter
discretion, avoiding open phone lines and faxes to discuss client business, so
the writer had taken advantage of a European visit to divert to Vienna
personally.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His schedule, alas, only permitted him three
days in Vienna, but if Herr Gemütlich would be gracious enough to spare him an
interview, he—the American—would be delighted to come to the bank.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The letter was dropped by the American
personally through the bank’s mail slot during the night, and by noon of the
next day, the bank’s messenger had deposited the reply at the Sheraton. Herr Gemütlich
would be delighted to see the American lawyer at ten the following morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the moment the spotter was shown in, his
eyes missed nothing. He took no notes, but no detail escaped and none were
forgotten. The receptionist checked his credentials, phoned upstairs to confirm
he was expected, and the commissionaire took him up—all the way to the austere
wooden door, upon which he knocked. Never was the spotter out of sight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Upon the command “<i>Herein</i>,” the
commissionaire opened the door and ushered the American visitor in, withdrawing
and closing it behind him before returning to his desk in the lobby.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Herr Wolfgang Gemütlich rose from his desk,
shook hands, gestured his guest to a chair opposite him, and resumed his place
behind his desk.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The word <i>Gemütlich</i> in German means “comfortable,”
with a hint of geniality. Never was a man less aptly named. This Gemütlich was
thin to the point of cadaverous, in his early sixties, gray-suited, gray-tied,
with thinning hair and face to match. He exuded grayness. There was not a hint
of humor in the pale eyes, and the welcoming smile of the papery lips was less
a grin than the rictus of something on a slab.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The office conveyed the same austerity as its
occupier; dark paneled walls, framed degrees in banking in place of pictures,
and a large ornate desk, whose surface was bare of any hint of clutter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Wolfgang Gemütlich was not a banker for fun;
clearly, all forms of fun were something of which he disapproved. Banking was
serious—more, it was life itself. If there was one thing that Herr Gemütlich
seriously deplored, it was the spending of money. Money was for saving,
preferably under the aegis of the Winkler Bank. A withdrawal could cause him
serious acidic pain, and a major transfer from a Winkler account to somewhere
else would ruin his entire week.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The spotter knew he was there to note and
report back. His primary task, now accomplished, was to identify the person of Gemütlich
for the yarid team out in the street. He was also looking for any safe that
might contain the operational details of the Jericho account, as well as
security locks, door bolts, alarm systems—in short, he was there to case the
joint for an eventual burglary.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Avoiding specifics of the amounts his client
wished to transfer to Europe but hinting at their immense size, the spotter
kept the conversation to inquiring as to the level of security and discretion
maintained by the Winkler Bank. Herr Gemütlich was happy to explain that
numbered accounts with Winkler were impregnable and discretion was obsessive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only once during the conversation were they interrupted.
A side door opened to admit a mouse of a woman, bearing three letters for
signature. Gemütlich frowned at the nuisance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You did say they were important, Herr Gemütlich.
Otherwise ...” said the woman. At second glance, she was not as old as her appearance
would have indicated—perhaps forty. It was the scraped-back hair, the bun, the
tweed suit, the lisle stockings, and flat shoes that suggested more.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Ja, ja, ja </i>...” said Gemütlich, and
held out his hand for the letters. “<i>Entschuldigung</i> ...,” he asked his
guest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He and the spotter had been using German, after
establishing that Gemütlich spoke only halting English. The spotter, however,
got to his feet and bobbed a small bow at the newcomer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent><i>“Gr</i><i>üss Gott, Fräulein</i>,” he said.
She looked flustered. Gemütlich’s guests did not usually rise for a secretary.
However, the gesture forced Gemütlich to clear his throat and mutter:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah, yes, er—my private secretary, Miss
Hardenberg.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The spotter noted that, too, as he sat down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he was shown out, with assurances that he
would offer his client in New York a most favorable account of the Winkler
Bank, the regimen was the same as for entry. The commissionaire was summoned
from the front hall and appeared at the door. The spotter made his farewells
and followed the man out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Together they went to the small, grille-fronted
elevator, which clanked its way downward. The spotter asked if he might use the
men’s room before he left. The commissionaire frowned as if such bodily
functions were not really expected within the Winkler Bank, but he stopped the
elevator at the mezzanine. Close to the elevator doors, he indicated to the
spotter an unmarked wooden door, and the spotter went in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was clearly for the bank’s male employees: a
single stall, a single booth, a handbasin and towel roll, and a closet. The
spotter ran the taps to create noise and did a quick check of the room. A
barred, sealed window, run through with the wires of an alarm system—possible,
but not easy. Ventilation by automatic fan. The closet contained brooms, pans,
cleaning fluids, and a vacuum cleaner. So they <i>did</i> have a cleaning
staff. But when did they work? Nights or weekends? If his own experience was
anything to go by, even the cleaner would work inside the private offices only
under supervision. Clearly, the commissionaire or the nightwatch could easily
be taken care of, but that was not the point. Kobi Dror’s orders had been
specific: No clues to be left behind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he emerged from the men’s room, the
commissionaire was still outside. Seeing that the broad marble steps to the
lobby half a floor down were farther along the corridor, the spotter smiled,
gestured to it, and strode along the corridor rather than take the elevator for
such a short ride.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The commissionaire trotted after him, escorted
him down to the lobby, and ushered him out of the door. The spotter heard the
big brass tongue of the self-locking mechanism close behind him. If the
commissionaire were upstairs, he wondered, how would the female receptionist
admit a client or messenger boy?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He spent two hours briefing Gidi Barzilai on
the internal workings of the bank, so far as he had been able to observe them,
and the report was gloomy. The head of the neviot team sat in, shaking his
head.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They could break in, he said. No problem. Find
the alarm system and neutralize it. But as for leaving no trace—that would be a
bastard. There was a nightwatchman who probably prowled at intervals. And then,
what would they be looking for? A safe? Where? What type? How old? Key or
combination or both? It would take hours. And they would have to silence the
nightwatch. That would leave a trace. But Dror had forbidden it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The spotter flew out of Vienna and back to Tel
Aviv the next day. That afternoon, from a series of photographs, he identified
Wolfgang Gemütlich and, for good measure, Fräulein Hardenberg. When he had
gone, Barzilai and the neviot team leader conferred again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Frankly, I need more inside information, Gidi.
There’s too much I don’t know still. The papers you need—he must keep them in a
safe. Where? Behind the paneling? A floor safe? In the secretary’s office? In a
special vault in the basement? We need inside information here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barzilai grunted. Long ago, in training, one of
the instructors had told them all: There is no such thing as a man with no weak
point. Find that point, press the nerve, and he’ll cooperate. The following
morning the whole yarid and neviot teams began an intensive surveillance of
Wolfgang Gemütlich.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the acidulous Viennese was about to prove
the instructor wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Steve Laing and Chip Barber had a major problem. By
mid-November, Jericho had come up with his first response to the questions put
to him via a dead-letter box in Baghdad. His price had been high, but the
American government had made the transfer into the Viennese account without a
murmur.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If Jericho’s information was accurate—and there
was no reason to suspect it was not—then it was extremely useful. He had not
answered all the questions, but he had answered some and confirmed others
already half-answered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Principally, he had named quite specifically
seventeen locations linked to the production of weapons of mass destruction.
Eight of these were locations already suspected by the Allies; of these, he had
corrected the locations of two. The other nine were new information, chief
among them the exact spot of the buried laboratory in which operated the
functioning gas-diffusion centrifuge cascade for the preparation of bomb-grade
uranium-235.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The problem was: How to tell the military,
without blowing away the fact that Langley and Century had a high-ranking asset
who was betraying Baghdad from the inside?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Not that the spymasters distrusted the
military. Far from it, they were senior officers for a reason. But in the
covert world there is an old and well-tested rule called “need to know.” A man
who does not know something cannot let it slip, however inadvertently. If the
men in civilian clothes simply produced a list of fresh targets out of nowhere,
how many generals, brigadiers, and colonels would work out where it had come
from?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the third week of the month, Barber and
Laing had a private meeting in the basement of the Saudi Defense Ministry, with
General Buster Glosson, deputy to General Chuck Horner, who commanded the air
war in the Gulf Theater.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though he must have had a first name, no one
ever referred to General Glosson as anything other than “Buster,” and it was he
who had planned and continued to plan the eventual comprehensive air attack on
Iraq that everyone knew would have to precede any ground invasion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>London and Washington had long since concurred
in the view that, regardless of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein’s war machine simply had
to be destroyed, and that very much included the manufacturing capabilities for
gas, germs, and nuclear bombs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before Desert Shield had finally destroyed any
chance of a successful Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia, the plans for the eventual
air war were well under way, under the secret code name of Instant Thunder. The
true architect of that air war was Buster Glosson.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By November 16, the United Nations and various
diplomatic chancelleries around the world were still scratching around for a “peace
plan” to end the crisis without a shot being fired, a bomb dropped, or a rocket
launched. The three men in the subterranean room that day all knew that such a
call-it-all-off plan was just not going to happen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber was concise and to the point: “As you
know, Buster, we and the Brits have been trying to get hard identification of
Saddam’s WMD facilities for months now.” The Air Force general nodded warily.
He had a map along the corridor with more pins than a porcupine, and each one
was a separate bombing target. What now?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So we started with the export licenses and
traced the exporting countries, then the companies in those countries that had fulfilled
the contracts. Then the scientists who fitted out the interiors of these
facilities, but many of them were taken to the sites in black-windowed buses,
lived on base, and never really knew where they had been.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Finally, Buster, we checked with the
construction people, the ones who actually built most of Saddam’s poison gas
palaces. And some of them have come up roses. Real paydirt.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber passed the new list of targets across to
the general. Glosson studied them with interest. They were not identified with
map grid references, such as a bomb-campaign plotter would need, but the
descriptions would be enough to identify them from the air photos already
available.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Glosson grunted. He knew some of the listings
were already targets; others, with question marks, were now being confirmed;
others were new. He raised his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This is for real?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Absolutely,” said the Englishman. “We are
convinced that the construction people are a good source, maybe the best yet,
because they are hard-hats who knew what they were doing when they built these
places, and they talk freely,, more so than the bureaucrats.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Glosson rose.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay. You going to have any more for me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We’ll just keep digging up there in Europe,
Buster,” said Barber. “We get any more hard-fact targets, we’ll pass them on.
They’ve buried a hell of a lot of stuff, you know. Deep under the desert. We’re
talking major construction projects.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You tell me where they’ve put ’em, and we’ll
blow the roof down on them,” said the general.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later, Glosson took the list to Chuck Horner.
The USAF chief was shorter than Glosson, a gloomy-looking, crumpled man with a
bloodhound face and all the diplomatic subtlety of a rhino with piles. But he
adored his aircrew and ground crew, and they responded in kind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was known that he would fight on their
behalf against the contractors, the bureaucrats, and the politicians right up
to the White House if he thought he had to, and never once moderate his
language. What you saw was what you got.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Visiting the Gulf States of Bahrain, Abu Dhabi,
and Dubai, where some of his crews were posted, he avoided the fleshpots of the
Sheratons and Hiltons where the good life flowed (literally) in order to chow
with the flight crews down at the base and sleep in a cot in the bunkhouse.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Servicemen and women have no appetite for
dissembling; they know quickly what they like and what they despise. The USAF
pilots would have flown string-and-wire biplanes against Iraq for Chuck Horner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Horner studied the list from the covert
intelligence people and grunted. Two of the sites showed up on the maps as bare
desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where did they get this from?” he asked
Glosson.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Interviewing the construction teams who built
them, so they say,” said Glosson.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bullshit,” said General Horner. “Those
cocksuckers have got themselves someone in Baghdad. Buster, we don’t say
anything about this—to anyone. Just take their goodies and rack ’em up on the
hit list.” He paused and thought, then added, “Wonder who the bastard is.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Steve Laing made it home to London on the eighteenth, a
London in frenzied turmoil over the crisis gripping the Conservative government
as a back-bench Member of Parliament sought to use the party rules to topple
Margaret Thatcher from the premiership.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Despite his tiredness, Laing took the message
on his desk from Terry Martin and called him at the school. Because of Martin’s
excitement, Laing agreed to see him for a brief drink after work, delaying
Laing’s return to his home in the outer suburbs by as little as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they were settled at a corner table in a
quiet bar in the West End, Martin produced from his attaché case a cassette
player and a tape. Showing them to Laing, he explained his request weeks ago to
Sean Plummer, and their meeting the previous weekend.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Shall I play it for you?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, if the chaps at GCHQ can’t understand
it, I know damned well I can’t,” said Laing. “Look, Sean Plummer’s got Arabs
like Al-Khouri on his staff. If <i>they</i> can’t work it out ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Still, he listened politely.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hear it?” asked Martin excitedly. “The ‘k’
sound after <i>have</i>? The man’s not invoking the help of Allah in Iraq’s
cause. He’s using a title. That’s what got the other man so angry. Clearly, no
one is supposed to use that title openly. It must be confined to a very tiny
circle of people.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But what does he actually say?” asked Laing in
complete bewilderment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin looked at him blankly. Didn’t Laing
understand anything?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He is saying that the vast American buildup
doesn’t matter, because ‘soon we shall have Qubth-ut-Allah.’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing still looked perplexed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A weapon,” urged Martin. “It must be.
Something to be available soon that will hold the Americans.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Forgive my poor Arabic,” said Laing, “but what
is Qubth-ut-Allah?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh,” said Martin. “It means ‘the Fist of God.’
”</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942763">Chapter 12</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>After eleven years in power and having won three general
elections, the British Prime Minister actually fell on November 20, although
she did not announce her decision to resign until two days later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her fall from power was triggered by an obscure
rule in the Conservative Party constitution requiring her nominal reelection as
Party leader at periodic intervals. Such an interval occurred that November.
Her reelection should have been just a formality, until an out-of-office former
minister chose to run against her. Unaware of her danger, she hardly took the
challenge seriously, conducting a lackluster campaign and actually attending a
conference in Paris on the day of the vote.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Behind her back a range of old resentments,
affronted egos, and nervous fears that she might even lose the forthcoming
general election coalesced into an alliance against her, preventing her from
being swept back into the Party leadership on the first ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Had she been so returned, there would have been
no second ballot, and the challenger would have disappeared into obscurity. In
the ballot of November 20 she needed a two-thirds majority; she was just four
votes short, forcing a runoff second ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within hours, what had started as a few
dislodged stones tumbling down a hill became a landslide. After consulting her
Cabinet, who told her she would now lose, she resigned. To head off the
challenger, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, ran for the top job
and won.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The news stunned the soldiers in the Gulf,
American and British alike. Down in Oman, American fighter pilots who were now
consorting daily with SAS men from the nearby base asked the British what was
going on and received helpless shrugs in return.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin heard the news when the Iraqi
chauffeur swaggered over and told him. Martin contemplated the news, looked
blank, and asked:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Who is she?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Fool,” snapped the chauffeur. “The leader of
the Beni Naji. Now we will win.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He went back to his car to resume listening to
Baghdad radio. In a few moments First Secretary Kulikov hurried from the house
and was driven straight back to his embassy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, Martin sent a long transmission to
Riyadh, containing the latest batch of answers from Jericho and an added
request from himself for further instructions. Crouched by the doorway of his
shack to ward off any intruders, for the satellite dish was positioned in the
doorway facing south, Martin waited for his reply. A low, pulsing light on the
console of the small transceiver told him at half past one in the morning that
he had his reply.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He dismantled the dish, stored it back beneath
the floor with the batteries and transceiver, slowed down the message, and
listened to it play back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a fresh list of demands for
information from Jericho and an agreement to the agent’s last demand for money,
which had now been transferred into his account. In under a month the renegade
on the Revolutionary Command Council had earned over a million dollars.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Added to the list were two further instructions
for Martin. The first was to send Jericho a message, not in the form of a
question, that it was hoped he could somehow filter into the thinking of the
planners in Baghdad. It was to the effect that the news from London probably
meant that the Coalition action to recover Kuwait would be called off if the Rais
stood firm.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Whether this disinformation reached the highest
councils of Baghdad will never be known, but within a week Saddam Hussein had
claimed that the toppling of Thatcher was due to the revulsion of the British
people at her opposition to him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The final instruction on Mike Martin’s tape
that night was to ask Jericho if he had ever heard of a weapon or weapon system
referred to as the Fist of God.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the light of a candle, Martin spent most of
the rest of the night writing the questions in Arabic onto two sheets of thin
airmail paper. Within twenty hours, the papers had been secreted behind the
loose brick in the wall close to the Imam Aladham shrine in Aadhamiya.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took a week for the answers to come back.
Martin read the spidery Arabic script of Jericho’s handwriting and translated
everything into English. From a soldier’s point of view, it was interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three Republican Guard divisions facing the
British and Americans along the border, the Tawakkulna and Medina, now joined
by the Hammurabi, were equipped with a mix of T-54/55, T-62, and T-72 main
battle tanks, all three Russian.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But on a recent tour, Jericho continued,
General Abdullah Kadiri of the Armored Corps had discovered to his horror that
most of the crews had removed their batteries and used them to power fans,
cookers, radios, and cassette players. It was doubtful if, in combat
conditions, any of them would now start. There had been several executions on
the spot, and two senior commanders had been relieved and sent home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saddam’s half-brother, Ali Hassan Majid, now
Governor-General of Kuwait, had reported that the occupation was becoming a
nightmare, with attacks on Iraqi soldiers still unquenchable and desertions
rising. The resistance showed no signs of abating, despite vigorous interrogations
and numerous executions by Colonel Sabaawi of the AMAM and two personal visits
by his boss, Omar Khatib.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Worse, the resistance had now somehow acquired
the plastic explosive called Semtex, which is much more powerful than
industrial dynamite.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Jericho had identified two more major military
command posts, both constructed in subterranean caverns and invisible from the
air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The thinking in the immediate circle around
Saddam Hussein was definitely that a seminal contribution to the fall of
Margaret Thatcher had been his own influence. He had twice reiterated his
absolute refusal even to consider pulling out of Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, Jericho had never heard of anything
code-named the Fist of God but would listen for such a phrase. Personally, he
doubted there existed any weapon or weapon system unknown to the Allies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin read the entire message onto tape,
speeded it up, and transmitted it. In Riyadh it was seized upon avidly and the
radio technicians logged its time of arrival: 2355 hours, November 30, 1990.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Leila Al-Hilla came out of the bathroom slowly, pausing in
the doorway with the light behind her to raise her arms to the doorframe on
each side and pose for a moment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bathroom light, shining through the
negligee, showed off her ripe and voluptuous silhouette to full advantage. It
should; it was black, of the sheerest lace, and had cost a small fortune, a
Paris import acquired from a boutique in Beirut.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The big man on the bed stared hungrily, ran a
furred tongue along a thick lower lip, and grinned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Leila liked to dawdle in the bathroom before a
session of sex. There were places to be washed and anointed, eyes to be
accentuated with mascara, lips to be etched in red, and perfumes to be applied,
different aromas for different parts of her body.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a good body at thirty summers, the sort
clients liked: not fat, but well-curved where it ought to be, full-hipped and
breasted, with muscle beneath the curves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She lowered her arms and advanced toward the
dim-lit bed, swinging her hips, the high-heeled shoes adding four inches to her
height and exaggerating the hip-swing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the man on the bed, on his back and naked,
covered like a bear in black fur from chin to ankles, had closed his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don’t go to sleep on me now, you oaf, she
thought, not tonight when I need you. Leila sat on the side of the bed and ran
sharp red fingernails up through the hair of the belly to the chest, tweaked
each nipple hard, then ran her hand back again, beyond the stomach to the
groin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She leaned forward and kissed the man on the
lips, her tongue prying an opening. But the man’s lips responded halfheartedly,
and she caught the strong odor of arak.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Drunk again, she thought—why can’t the fool
stay off the stuff. Still, it had its advantages, that bottle of arak every
evening. Oh well, to work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Leila Al-Hilla was a good courtesan, and she
knew it. The best in the Middle East, some said, and certainly among the most
expensive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She had trained years ago, as a child, in a
very private academy in Lebanon where the sexual wiles and tricks of the <i>ouled-nails</i>
of Morocco, of the <i>nautch</i> girls of India, and the subtle technocrats of <i>Fukutomi-cho</i>
were practiced by the older girls while the children watched and learned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After fifteen years as a professional on her
own, she knew that ninety percent of the skill of a good whore had nothing to
do with the problem of coping with insatiable virility. That was for porn
magazines and films.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her talent was to flatter, compliment, praise,
and indulge, but mainly to elicit a real male erection out of an endless
succession of jaded appetites and faded powers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She ran her probing hand out of the groin and
felt the man’s penis. Sighed inwardly. Soft as a marshmallow. General Abdullah
Kadiri, commander of the Armored Corps of the Army of the Republic of Iraq, was
going to need a little encouraging this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From beneath the bed where she had secreted it
earlier, she took a soft cloth bag and tipped its contents onto the sheet
beside her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Smearing her fingers with a thick, creamy
jelly, she lubricated a medium-size dildo-vibrator, lifted one of the general’s
thighs, and slipped it expertly into his anus.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Kadiri grunted, opened his eyes,
glanced down at the naked woman crouching beside his genitals, and grinned
again, the teeth flashing beneath the thick black moustache.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Leila pressed the disk on the base of the
vibrator, and the insistent pulsing throb began to fill the general’s lower
body. Beneath her hand the woman felt the limp organ begin to swell.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From a flask with a tube sticking through the seal
she half-filled her mouth with a swig of tasteless, odorless petroleum jelly,
then leaned forward and took the man’s stirring penis into her mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The combination of the oily smoothness of the
jelly and rapid probing of her skillful pointed tongue began to have an effect.
For ten minutes, until her jaw ached, she caressed and sucked until the general’s
erection was as good as it was ever going to be.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before he could lose it, she lifted her head,
swung an ample thigh across him, inserted him into her, and settled across his
hips. She had felt bigger and better ones, but it was working—just.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Leila leaned forward and swung her breasts over
his face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah, my big strong black bear,” she cooed, “you
are superb, as ever.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He smiled up at her. She began to rise and
settle, not too fast, rising until the helmet was just still between the labia,
settling slowly until she had enveloped everything he had. As she moved, she
used developed and practiced vaginal muscles to grip and squeeze, relax, grip
and squeeze.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She knew the effect of the double incitement.
General Kadiri began to grunt and then shout, short harsh cries forced out of
him by the sensation of the deep pulsing throb in his sphincter area and the
woman rising and falling on his shaft with steadily increasing rhythm.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, yes, oh yes, this is so good, keep going,
darling,” she panted into his face until finally he had his orgasm. While he
climaxed into her hips, Leila straightened her torso, towering over him,
jerking in spasm, screaming with pleasure, faking her own tremendous climax.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he was spent, he deflated at once and in
seconds she had removed herself and his dildo, tossing it to one side lest he
fall asleep too soon. That was the last thing she wanted after all her hard
work. There was yet more work to do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So she lay beside him and drew the sheet over
them both, propping herself on one elbow, letting her bosom press against the
side of his face, smoothing his hair and stroking his cheek with her free right
hand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Poor bear,” she murmured. “Are you very tired?
You work too hard, my magnificent lover. They work you too hard. What was it
today, eh? More problems on the Council, and always you who has to solve them?
Mmmmmm? Tell Leila, you know you can tell little Leila.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So before he slept, he did.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later, when General Kadiri was snoring away the
effects of arak and sex, Leila retired to the bathroom where, with the door
locked and seated on the toilet with a tray across her lap, she noted
everything down in a neat, crabbed Arabic script.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later still, in the morning, the sheets of
flimsy paper rolled into a hollowed-out tampon to avoid the security checks,
she would hand it over to the man who paid her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was dangerous, she knew, but it was
lucrative, double earnings for the same job, and one day she intended to be
rich—rich enough to leave Iraq forever and set up her own academy, perhaps in
Tangier, with a string of nice girls to sleep with and Moroccan houseboys to
whip whenever she felt the need.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>If Gidi Barzilai had been frustrated by the security
procedures of the Winkler Bank, two weeks of trailing Wolfgang Gemütlich were
driving him to distraction. The man was impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After the spotter’s identification, Gemütlich
had quickly been followed to his house out beyond the Prater Park. The next day,
while he was at work, the yarid team had watched the house until Frau Gemütlich
left to go shopping. The girl member of the team went after her, staying in
touch with her colleagues by personal radio so that she could warn them of the
lady’s return. In fact, the banker’s wife was away for two hours—more than
ample time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The break-in by the neviot experts was no
problem, and bugs were quickly planted in sitting room, bedroom, and telephone.
The search—quick, skilled, and leaving no trace—yielded nothing. There were the
usual papers: deeds to the house, passports, birth certificates, marriage
license, even a series of bank statements. Everything was photographed, but a
glance at the private bank account revealed no evidence of embezzlement from
the Winkler Bank—there was even a horrible chance that the man would turn out
to be completely honest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The wardrobe and bedroom drawers revealed no
sign of bizarre personal habits—always a good blackmail lever among the
respectable middle classes—and indeed the neviot team leader, having watched
Frau Gemütlich leave the house, was not surprised.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the man’s personal secretary was a mousy
little thing, his wife was like a scrap of discarded paper. The Israeli thought
he had seldom seen such a downcast little shrimp.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the time the yarid girl came on the radio
with a muttered warning that the banker’s wife was heading home, the neviot
break-in experts were finished and out. The front door was relocked by the man
in the telephone company uniform after the rest had scuttled out the back and
through the garden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From then on, the neviot team would man the
tape recorders in the van down the street to listen to the goings-on inside the
house.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two weeks later a despairing team leader told
Barzilai they had hardly filled one tape. On the first evening they had
recorded eighteen words. She had said: “Here’s your dinner, Wolfgang”—no reply.
She had asked for new curtains—refused. He had said, “Early day tomorrow, I’m
off to bed.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He says it every bloody night, it’s like he’s
been saying it for thirty years,” complained the neviot man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Any sex?” asked Barzilai.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You must be joking, Gidi. They don’t even
talk, let alone screw.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All other leads to a flaw in the character of
Wolfgang Gemütlich came up zero. There was no gambling, no small boys, no
socializing, no nightclubbing, no mistress, no scuttling through the red-light
district. On one occasion he left the house, and the spirits of the trailing
team rose. Gemütlich was in a dark coat and hat, on foot, after dark and after
supper, moving through the darkened suburb until he came to a private house
five blocks away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He knocked and waited. The door opened, he was
admitted, and it closed. Soon a ground-floor light came on, behind heavy
drapes. Before the door closed, one of the Israeli watchers caught a glimpse of
a grim-looking woman in a white nylon tunic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Aesthetic baths, perhaps? Assisted showers,
mixed sauna with two hefty wenches to handle the birch twigs? A check the next
morning revealed that the woman in the tunic was an elderly chiropodist who ran
a small practice from her own home. Wolfgang Gemütlich had been having his
corns trimmed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the first of December, Gidi Barzilai
received a rocket from Kobi Dror in Tel Aviv. This was not an operation without
a limit of time, he was warned. The United Nations had given Iraq till January
16 to get out of Kuwait. After that, there would be war. Anything might happen.
Get on with it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Gidi, we can follow this bastard till hell
freezes over,” the two team leaders told their controller. “There’s just no
dirt in his life. I don’t understand the bastard. Nothing—he does nothing we
can use on him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barzilai was in a dilemma. They could kidnap
the wife and threaten the husband that he had better cooperate or else. ...
Trouble was, the sleaze would trade her in rather than steal a luncheon
voucher. Worse, he would call the cops.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They could kidnap Gemütlich and work him over.
The trouble there was, the man would have to go back to the bank to make the
transfer to close down the Jericho account. Once inside the bank, he’d yell
blue murder. Kobi Dror had said, no miss and no traces.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let’s switch to the secretary,” Barzilai said.
“Confidential secretaries often know everything their boss knows.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So the two teams switched their attentions to
the equally dull-looking Fräulein Edith Hardenberg.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She took even less time, just ten days. They
tailed her to her home, a small apartment in a staid old house just off
Trautenauplatz far out in the Nineteenth District, the northwestern suburb of
Grinzing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She lived alone. No lover, no boyfriend, not
even a pet. A search of her private papers revealed a modest bank account, a
mother in retirement in Salzburg. The apartment itself had once been rented by
the mother, as the rent book showed, but the daughter had moved in seven years
earlier when the mother returned to her native Salzburg.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Edith drove a small Seat car, which she parked
on the street outside the flat, but she mainly commuted to work by public
transportation, no doubt due to the parking difficulties in the city center.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her pay stubs revealed a stingy salary—“mean
bastards,” exploded the neviot searcher when he saw the sum—and her birth
certificate revealed she was thirty-nine—“and looking fifty,” remarked the
searcher.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were no pictures of men in the flat, just
one of her mother, one of them both on vacation by some lake, and one of her
apparently deceased father in the uniform of the customs service.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If there was any man in her life, it appeared
to be Mozart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“She’s an opera buff, and that’s all,” the
neviot team leader reported back to Barzilai, after the flat had been left
exactly as they found it. “There’s a big collection of LP records—she hasn’t
gotten around to compact disks yet—and they’re all opera. Must spend most of
her spare cash on them. Books on opera, on composers, singers, and conductors.
Posters of the Vienna Opera winter calendar, though she couldn’t begin to
afford a ticket.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No man in her life, eh?” mused Barzilai.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“She might fall for Pavarotti, if you can get
him. Apart from that, forget it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But Barzilai did not forget it. He recalled a
case in London, long ago. A civil servant in Defence, real spinster type; then
the Sovs had produced this stunning young Yugoslav ... even the judge had been
sympathetic at her trial.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That evening Barzilai sent a long encrypted
cable to Tel Aviv.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>By the middle of December, the buildup of the Coalition
army south of the Kuwaiti border had become a great, inexorable tidal wave of
men and steel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Three hundred thousand men and women of thirty
nations stretched in a series of lines across the Saudi desert from the coast
and westward for over a hundred miles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the ports of Jubail, Dammam, Bahrain, Doha,
Abu Dhabi, and Dubai the cargo ships came in from the sea to disgorge guns and
tanks, fuel and stores, food and bedding, ammunition and spares in endless
succession.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the docks the convoys rolled west along
the Tapline Road to establish the vast logistic bases that would one day supply
the invading army.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A Tornado pilot from Tabuq, flying south from a
feint attack on the Iraqi border, told his squadron colleagues he had flown
over the nose of a convoy of trucks and then on to the tail of the line. At
five hundred miles per hour, it had taken him six minutes to reach the end of
the line of trucks fifty miles away, and they had been rolling nose to tail.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At Logistic Base Alpha one compound had oil
drums stacked three high on top of each other, on pallets six feet by six, with
lines between them the width of a forklift truck. The compound was forty
kilometers by forty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And that was just for fuel. Other compounds at
Log Alpha had shells, rockets, mortars, caissons of machine-gun rounds,
armor-piercing antitank warheads, and grenades. Others contained food and
water, machinery and spares, tank batteries and mobile workshops.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At that time the Coalition forces were confined
by General Schwarzkopf to the portion of desert due south of Kuwait. What
Baghdad could not know was that before he attacked, the American general
intended to send more forces across the Wadi al Batin and another hundred miles
farther west into the desert, to invade Iraq itself, pushing due north and then
east to take the Republican Guard in flank and destroy it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On December 13 the Rocketeers, the 336th
Squadron of the USAF Tactical Air Command, left their base at Thumrait in Oman
and transferred to Al Kharz in Saudi Arabia. It was a decision that had been
made on December 1.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Al Kharz was a bare-bones airfield, constructed
with runways and taxi tracks but nothing else. No control tower, no hangars, no
workshops, no accommodations for anyone—just a flat sheet in the desert with
strips of concrete.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But it <i>was</i> an airfield. With amazing
foresight, the Saudi government had commissioned and built enough air bases to
host an air power totaling more than five times the Royal Saudi Air Force.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After December 1 the American construction
teams moved in. In just thirty days a tented city capable of housing five
thousand people and five fighter squadrons had been built.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Principal among the builders were the heavy
engineers, the Red Horse teams, backed by forty huge electric generators from
the Air Force. Some of the equipment came by road on low-loaders, but most by
air. They built the clamshell hangars, workshops, fuel stores, ordnance depots,
flight and briefing rooms, operations rooms, control towers, store tents, and
garages.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For the aircrew and ground crew they erected
streets of tents with roadways between, latrines, bathhouses, kitchens, mess
halls, and a water tower to be replenished by convoys of trucks from the
nearest water source.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Al Kharz lies fifty miles southeast of Riyadh,
which turned out to be just three miles beyond the maximum range of the Scud
missiles in Iraq’s possession. It would be home for three months to five
squadrons: two of F-15E Strike Eagles—the 336th Rocketeers and the Chiefs, the
335th Squadron out of Seymour Johnson, who joined at this point; one of F-15C
pure-fighter Eagles; and two of F-16 Falcon fighters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a special street for the 250 female
personnel in the wing; these included the lawyer, ground-crew chiefs, truck
drivers, clerks, nurses, and two squadron intelligence officers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The aircrew flew themselves up from Thumrait;
the ground crew and other staff came by cargo airplane. The entire transshipment
took two days, and when they arrived, the engineers were still at work and
would remain so until Christmas.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker had enjoyed his time in Thumrait.
Living conditions were modern and excellent, and in the relaxed atmosphere of
Oman, alcoholic drinks were permitted within the base.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For the first time, he had met the British SAS,
who have a permanent training base there, and other “contract officers” serving
with the Omani forces of Sultan Qaboos. Some memorable parties were held,
members of the opposite sex were eminently datable, and flying the Eagles on
feint missions up to the Iraqi border had been great.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Of the SAS, after a trip into the desert with
them in light scout cars, Walker had remarked to the newly appointed squadron
commander, Lieutenant Colonel Steve Turner:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“These guys are certifiably insane.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Al Kharz would turn out to be different from
Thumrait. As the home of the two holy places, Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia
enforces strict teetotalism, as well as any exposure of the female form below
the chin, excluding hands and feet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In his General Order Number, One, General
Schwarzkopf had banned all alcohol for the entire Coalition forces under his
command. All American units abided by that order, and it strictly applied at Al
Kharz.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the port of Dammam, however, the American
off-loaders were bemused by the amount of shampoo destined for the British
Royal Air Force. Crate after crate of the stuff was unloaded, put onto trucks
or C-130 Hercules air-freighters, and brought to the RAF squadrons. They
remained puzzled that in a largely waterless environment, the British aircrew
could spend so much time washing their hair. It was an enigma that would
continue to puzzle them until the end of the war.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the other side of the peninsula, on the
desert base of Tabuq, which British Tornados shared with American Falcons, the
USAF pilots were even more intrigued to see the British at sundown, seated
beneath their awnings, decanting a small portion of shampoo into a glass and
topping it up with bottled water.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At Al Kharz the problem did not arise—there was
no shampoo. Conditions, moreover, were more cramped than at Thumrait. Apart
from the wing commander, who had a tent to himself, the others from colonel on
down shared on the basis of two, four, six, eight, or twelve to a tent,
according to rank.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even worse, the female personnel were out of
bounds, a problem made even more frustrating by the fact that the American
women, true to their culture and with no Saudi Mutawa—religious police—to see
them, took to sun-bathing in bikinis behind low fences that they erected around
their tents.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This led to a rush by the aircrew to commandeer
all the hilux trucks on the base, vehicles with their chassis set high above
the wheels. Only from the top of these, standing on tiptoe, could a real patriot
proceed from his tent to the flight lines, passing through an enormous
diversion to drive down the street between the female tents, and check that the
women were in good shape.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Apart from these civic obligations, for most it
was back to a creaking cot and the “happy sock.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was also a new mood for another reason.
The United Nations had issued its January 15 deadline to Saddam Hussein. The
declarations coming out of Baghdad remained defiant. For the first time it
became clear that they were going to go to war. The training missions took on a
new and urgent edge.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>For some reason, December 15 in Vienna was quite warm. The
sun shone, and the temperature rose. At the lunch hour Fräulein Hardenberg left
the bank as usual for her modest lunch and decided on a whim to buy sandwiches
and eat them in the Stadtpark a few blocks away from the Ballgasse.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was her habit to do this through the summer
and even into the autumn, and for this she always brought her sandwiches with
her. On December 15 she had none.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nevertheless, looking at the bright blue sky
above Franzis-kanerplatz and protected by her neat tweed coat, she decided that
if nature was going to offer, even for one day, a bit of <i>Altweibersommer</i>—old
ladies’ summer, to the Viennese—she would take advantage and eat in the park.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a special reason she loved the small
park across the Ring. At one end is the Hübner Kursalon, a glass-walled
restaurant like a large conservatory. Here during the lunch hour a small
orchestra is wont to play the melodies of Strauss, that most Viennese of
composers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Without being able to afford to lunch there,
others can sit outside the enclosure and enjoy the music for free. Moreover, in
the center of the park, protected by his stone arch, stands the statue of the
great Johann himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Edith Hardenberg bought her sandwiches at a
local lunch-bar, found a park bench in the sun, and nibbled away while she
listened to the waltz tunes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Entschuldigung</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She jumped, jerked out of her reverie by the
low voice saying “Excuse me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If there was one thing Miss Hardenberg would
have none of, it was being addressed by a complete stranger. She glanced to her
side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was young and dark-haired, with soft brown
eyes, and his voice had a foreign accent. She was about to look firmly away again
when she noticed the young man had an illustrated brochure of some kind in his
hand and was pointing at a word in the text. Despite herself she glanced down.
The brochure was the illustrated program notes for <i>The Magic Flute</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Please, this word—it is not German, no?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His forefinger was pointing at the word <i>portitura</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She should have left there and then, of course,
just gotten up and walked away. She began to rewrap her sandwiches.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No,” she said shortly, “it’s Italian.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah,” said the man apologetically. “I am
learning German, but I do not understand Italian. Does it mean the story,
please?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No,” she said, “it means the score, the music.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you,” he said with genuine gratitude. “It
is so hard to understand your Viennese operas, but I do love them so much.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her fingers slowed in their flutter to wrap the
remaining sandwiches and leave.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It is set in Egypt, you know,” the young man
explained. Such nonsense, to tell her that, she who knew every word of <i>Die
Zauberfl</i><i>öte</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Indeed it is,” she said. This had gone far
enough, she told herself. Whoever he was, he was a very impudent young man.
Why, they were almost in conversation. The very idea.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The same as <i>A</i><i>ïda</i>,” he remarked,
back to studying his program notes. “I like Verdi, but I think I prefer Mozart.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her sandwiches were rewrapped; she was ready to
go. She should just stand up and go. She turned to look at him, and he chose
that moment to look up and smile.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a very shy smile, almost pleading; brown
spaniel eyes topped by lashes a model would have killed for.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There is no comparison,” she said. “Mozart is
the master of them all.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His smile widened, showing even white teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He lived here once. Perhaps he sat here, right
on this bench, and made his music.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m sure he did no such thing,” she said. “The
bench was not here then.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She rose and turned. The young man rose too and
gave a short Viennese bow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I am sorry I disturbed you, Fräulein. But
thank you for your help.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was walking out of the park, back to her
desk to finish her lunch, furious with herself. Conversations with young men in
parks—whatever next? On the other hand, he was only a foreign student trying to
learn about Viennese opera. No harm in that, surely. But enough is enough. She
passed a poster. Of course; the Vienna Opera was staging <i>The Magic Flute </i>in
three days. Perhaps it was part of the young man’s study course.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Despite her passion, Edith Hardenberg had never
been to an opera in the Staatsoper. She had, of course, roamed the building
when it was open in the daytime, but an orchestra ticket had always been beyond
her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were almost beyond price. Season tickets
for the opera were handed down from generation to generation. A season’s <i>abonnement</i>
was for the seriously rich. Other tickets could be obtained only by influence,
of which she had none. Even ordinary tickets were beyond her means. She sighed
and returned to her work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That one day of warm weather had been the end.
The cold and the gray clouds came back. She returned to her habit of lunching
at her usual café and at her usual table. She was a very neat lady, a creature
of habit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the third day after the park she arrived at
her table at the usual hour, to the minute, and half-noticed that the one next
to her was occupied. There was a pair of student books—she did not bother with
the titles—and a half-drunk glass of water.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hardly had she ordered the meal of the day when
the occupant of the table returned from the men’s room. It was not until he sat
down that he recognized her and gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, <i>Gr</i><i>üss Gott</i>—again,” he said.
Her lips tightened into a disapproving line. The waitress arrived and put down
her meal. She was trapped. But the young man was irrepressible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I finished the program notes. I think I
understand it all now.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She nodded and began delicately to eat. “Excellent.
You are studying here?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now why had she asked that? What madness had
gotten into her? But the chatter of the restaurant rose all around her. What
are you worrying about, Edith? Surely a civilized conversation, even with a
foreign student, could do no harm? She wondered what Herr Gemütlich would
think. He would disapprove, of course.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The dark young man grinned happily.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. I study engineering. At the Technical
University. When I have my degree, I will go back home and help to develop my
country. Please, my name is Karim.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Fräulein Hardenberg,” she said primly. “And
where do you come from, Herr Karim?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I am from Jordan.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Oh, good gracious, an Arab. Well, she supposed
there were a lot of them at the Technical University, two blocks across the Kärntner
Ring. Most of the ones she saw were street vendors, awful people selling
carpets and newspapers at the pavement cafes and refusing to go away. The young
man next to her looked respectable enough. Perhaps he came from a better
family. But after all ... an Arab. She finished her meal and signaled for the
bill. Time to leave this young man’s company, even though he was remarkably
polite. For an Arab.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Still,” he said regretfully, “I don’t think I’ll
be able to go.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her bill came. She fumbled for some schilling
notes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Go where?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“To the opera. To see <i>The Magic Flute</i>.
Not alone—I wouldn’t have the nerve. So many people. Not knowing where to go,
where to applaud.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She smiled tolerantly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, I don’t think you’ll go, young man,
because you won’t get any tickets.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He looked puzzled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh no, it’s not that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He reached into his pocket and placed two
pieces of paper on the table. Her table. Beside her bill. Second row of the
orchestra. Within feet of the singers. Center aisle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I have a friend in the United Nations. They
get an allocation, you know. But he didn’t want them, so he gave them to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gave. Not sold, gave. Beyond price, and he gave
them away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Would you,” asked the young man pleadingly, “take
me with you? Please?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was beautifully phrased, as if she would be
taking him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She thought of sitting in that great, vaulted,
gilded, rococo paradise, her spirit rising with the voices of the basses,
baritones, tenors, and sopranos high into the painted ceiling above. ...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Certainly not,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, I am sorry, Fräulein. I have offended you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He reached out and took the tickets, one half
in one strong young hand, the other half in the other, and began to tear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No.” Her hand came down on his own before more
than half an inch of the priceless tickets had been torn in half. “You mustn’t
do that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was bright pink.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But they are of no use to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, I suppose ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His face lit up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then you will show me your Opera House? Yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent><i>Show</i> him the Opera. Surely that was
different. Not a date. Not the sort of dates people went on who ... accepted
dates. More like a tour guide, really. A Viennese courtesy, showing a student
from abroad one of the wonders of the Austrian capital. No harm in that ...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They met on the steps by arrangement at
seven-fifteen. She had driven in from Grinzing and parked without trouble. They
joined the bustle of the moving throng alive already with anticipatory
pleasure.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If Edith Hardenberg, spinster of twenty
loveless summers, were ever going to have an intimation of paradise, it was that
night in 1990 when she sat a few feet from the stage and allowed herself to
drown in the music. If she were ever to know the sensation of being drunk, it
was that evening when she permitted herself to become utterly intoxicated in
the torrent of the rising and falling voices.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the first half, as Papageno sang and
cavorted before her, she felt a dry young hand placed on top of her own.
Instinct caused her to withdraw her hand sharply. In the second half, when it
happened again, she did nothing and felt, with the music, the warmth seeping
into her of another person’s blood-heat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When it was over, she was still intoxicated.
Otherwise she would never have allowed him to walk her across the square to
Freud’s old haunt, the Café Landtmann, now restored to its former 1890 glory.
There it was the superlative headwaiter Robert himself who showed them to a
table, and they ate a late dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Afterward, he walked her back to her car. She
had calmed down. Her reserve was reasserting itself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I would so like you to show me the real
Vienna,” said Karim quietly. “Your Vienna, the Vienna of fine museums and concerts.
Otherwise, I will never understand the culture of Austria, not the way you
could show it to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What are you saying, Karim?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They stood by her car. No, she was definitely
not offering him a lift to his apartment, wherever it was, and any suggestion
that he come home with her would reveal exactly what sort of a wretch he really
was.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That I would like to see you again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If he tells me I am beautiful, I will hit him,
she thought.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because you are kind,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was bright pink in the darkness. Without a
further word he bent forward and kissed her on the cheek. Then he was gone,
striding away across the square. She drove home alone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, Edith Hardenberg’s dreams were
troubled. She dreamed of long ago. Once there had been Horst, who had loved her
through that long hot summer of 1970 when she was nineteen and a virgin. Horst,
who had taken her chastity and made her love him. Horst, who had walked out in
the winter without a note or an explanation or a word of farewell.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At first she had thought he must have had an
accident, and she called all the hospitals. Then that his employment as a
traveling salesman had called him away and he would call.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later, she learned he had married the girl in
Graz whom he had also been loving when his rounds took him there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She had cried until the spring. Then she took
all the memories of him, all the signs of his being there, and burned them. She
burned the presents and the photos they had taken as they walked in the grounds
and sailed on the lakes of the Schlosspark at Laxenburg, and most of all she
burned the picture of the tree under which he had loved her first, really loved
her and made her his own.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She had had no more men. They just betray you
and leave you, her mother had said, and her mother was right. There would be no
more men, ever, she vowed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, a week before Christmas, the dreams
ebbed away before the dawn, and she slept with the program of <i>The Magic
Flute</i> clutched to her thin little bosom. As she slept, some of the lines
seemed to ease away from the corners of her eyes and the edges of her mouth.
And as she slept, she smiled. Surely there was no harm in that.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942764">Chapter 13</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The big gray Mercedes was having trouble with the traffic.
Hammering furiously on the horn, the driver had to force a passage through the
torrent of cars, vans, market stalls, and pushcarts that create the tangle of
life between the streets called Khulafa and Rashid.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This was old Baghdad, where traders and
merchants, sellers of cloth, gold, and spices, hawkers and vendors of most
known commodities, had plied their trades for ten centuries.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The car turned down Bank Street, where both
sides of the road were jammed with parked cars, and finally nosed into Shurja
Street. Ahead of it, the street market of spice sellers was impenetrable. The
driver half-turned his head.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This is as far as I can go.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Leila Al-Hilla nodded and waited for the door
to be opened for her. Beside the driver sat Kemal, General Kadiri’s hulking
personal bodyguard, a lumbering sergeant of the Armored Corps who had been
attached to Kadiri’s staff for years. She hated him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After a pause, the sergeant opened his door,
straightened his great frame on the sidewalk, and opened the rear passenger
door. He knew she had humiliated him once again, and it showed in his eyes. She
alighted from the car and gave him not a glance or word of thanks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One reason she hated the bodyguard was that he
followed her everywhere. It was his job, of course, assigned to him by Kadiri,
but that did not make her dislike him less. When he was sober, Kadiri was a
tough professional soldier; in matters sexual he was also insanely jealous.
Hence his rule that she should never be alone in the city.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other reason for her dislike of the
bodyguard was his evident lust for her. A woman of long-degraded tastes, she
could well understand that any man might lust for her body, and if the price
was right she would indulge any such lust, no matter how bizarre its
fulfillment. But Kemal committed the ultimate insult: As a sergeant, he was
poor. How dare he entertain such thoughts? Yet he clearly did—a mixture of
contempt for her and brutish desire. It showed when he knew General Kadiri was
not looking.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For his part he knew of her revulsion, and it
amused him to insult her with his glances while verbally maintaining an
attitude of formality.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She had complained to Kadiri about his dumb
insolence, but he had merely laughed. He could suspect any man of desiring her,
but Kemal was allowed many liberties because Kemal had saved his life in the
marshes of Al Fao against the Iranians, and Kemal would die for him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bodyguard slammed the door and was at her
side as they continued on foot down Shurja Street.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This zone is called Agid al Nasara, the Area of
the Christians. Apart from St. George’s Church across the river, built by the
British for themselves and their Protestant faith, there are three Christian
sects in Iraq, representing among them some seven percent of the population.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The largest is the Assyrian or Syriac sect,
whose cathedral lies within the Area of the Christians, off Shurja Street. A
mile away stands the Armenian church, close to another tangled web of small
streets and alleys whose history goes back many centuries called the Camp el
Arman, the old Armenian Quarter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Cheek by jowl with the Syriac cathedral stands
St. Joseph’s, the church of the Chaldean Christians, the smallest sect. If the Syriac
rite resembles Greek Orthodox, the Chaldeans are an offshoot of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The most notable Iraqi of the Chaldean
Christians was then Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, although his doglike devotion
to Saddam Hussein and his policies of genocide might indicate that Mr. Aziz had
somehow gone adrift from the teachings of the Prince of Peace. Leila Al-Hilla
had also been born a Chaldean, and now the link was proving useful.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The ill-assorted couple reached the
wrought-iron gate giving onto the cobbled yard in front of the arched door of
the Chaldean church. Kemal stopped. As a Moslem, he would not go a step
farther. She nodded to him and walked through the gate. Kemal watched her as
she bought a small candle from a stall by the door, drew her heavy black lace
shawl over her head, and entered the dark, incense-heavy interior.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bodyguard shrugged and sauntered away a few
yards to buy a can of Coke and find a place to sit and watch the doorway. He
wondered why his master permitted this nonsense. The woman was a whore; the
general would tire of her one day, and he, Kemal, had been promised that he
could have his pleasure before she was dismissed. He smiled at the prospect,
and a dribble of cola ran down his chin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside the church Leila paused to light her
candle from one of the hundreds that burned adjacent to the door, then, head
bowed, made her way to the confessional boxes on the far side of the nave. A
black-robed priest passed but paid her no attention.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was always the same confessional box. She
entered at the precise hour, dodging ahead of a woman in black who also sought
a priest to listen to her litany of sins, probably more banal than those of the
younger woman who pushed her aside and took her place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Leila closed the door behind her, turned, and
sat on the penitent’s seat. To her right was a fretted grille. She heard a
rustle behind it. He would be there; he was always there at the appointed hour.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Who was he? she wondered. Why did he pay so
handsomely for the information she brought him? He was not a foreigner—his
Arabic was too good for that, the Arabic of one born and raised in Baghdad. And
his money was good, very good.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Leila?” The voice was a murmur, low and even.
She always had to arrive after him and leave before him. He had warned her not
to loiter outside in the hopes of seeing him, but how could she have done that
anyway, with Kemal lurking at her shoulder? The oaf would see something and
report to his master. It was more than her life was worth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Identify yourself, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Father, I have sinned in matters of the flesh
and am not worthy of your absolution.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was he who had invented the phrase, because
no one else would say that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What have you for me?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She reached between her legs, pulled aside the
crotch of her panties, and abstracted the phony tampon he had given her weeks
ago. One end unscrewed. From the hollow interior she withdrew a thin roll of
paper formed into a tube no larger than a pencil. This she passed through the
fret of the grille.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Wait.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She heard the rustle of the onionskin paper as
the man ran a skilled eye over the notes she had made—a report on the
deliberations and conclusions of the previous day’s planning council chaired by
Saddam Hussein himself, at which General Abdullah Kadiri had been present.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good, Leila. Very good.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Today the money was in Swiss francs, very
high-denomination notes, passed through the grille from him to her. She
secreted them all in the place she had stored her information, a place she knew
most Moslem men deemed unclean at a certain time. Only a doctor or the dreaded
AMAM would find them there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How long must this go on?” she asked the
grille.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not long now. War is coming soon. By the end
of it, the Rais will fall. Others will take the power. I shall be one of them.
Then you will be truly rewarded, Leila. Stay calm, do your job, and be patient.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She smiled. Really rewarded. Money, lots of
money, enough to go far away and be wealthy for the rest of her days.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Go now.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She rose and left the booth. The old woman in
black had found someone else to hear her confession. Leila recrossed the nave
and emerged into the sunshine. The oaf Kemal was beyond the wrought-iron gate,
crumpling a tin can in one great fist, sweating in the heat. Good, let him
sweat. He would sweat much more if only he knew. ...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Without glancing at him, she turned down Shurja
Street, through the teeming market, toward the parked car. Kemal, furious but
helpless, lumbered behind her. She took not the slightest bit of notice of a
poor <i>fellagha</i> pushing a bicycle with an open wicker basket on the
pillion, and he took not the slightest notice of her. The man was only in the
market at the behest of the cook in the household where he worked, buying mace,
coriander, and saffron.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Alone in his confessional, the man in the black
cassock of a Chaldean priest sat awhile longer to ensure that his agent was clear
of the street. It was extremely unlikely that she would recognize him, but in
this game even outside chances were excessive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had meant what he said to her. War was
coming. The Americans had the bit between their teeth and would not now back
off.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So long as that fool in the palace by the river
at the Tamuz Bridge did not spoil it all and pull back unilaterally from
Kuwait. Fortunately, he seemed hell-bent on his own destruction. The Americans
would win the war, and then they would come to Baghdad to finish the job.
Surely they would not just win Kuwait and think that was the end of it? No
people could be so powerful and so stupid.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they came, they would need a new regime.
Being Americans, they would gravitate toward someone who spoke fluent English,
someone who understood their ways, their thoughts, and their speech, and who
would know what to say to please them and become their choice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The very education, the very cosmopolitan
urbanity that now militated against him, would be in his favor. For the moment,
he was excluded from the highest counsels and innermost decisions of the Rais—because
he was not of the oafish Al-Tikriti tribe, or a lifetime fanatic of the Ba’ath
Party, or a full general, or a half-brother of Saddam.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But Kadiri was Tikrit—and trusted. Only a
mediocre general of tanks and with the tastes of a rutting camel, he had once
played in the dust of the alleys of Tikrit with Saddam and his clan, and that
was enough. Kadiri was present at every decision-making meeting and knew all
the secrets. The man in the confessional needed to know these things in order
to make his preparations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he was satisfied that the coast was clear,
the man rose and left. Instead of crossing the nave, he slipped through a side
door into the vestry, nodded at a real priest who was robing for a service, and
left the church by a back door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man with the bicycle was only twenty feet
away. He happened to glance up as the priest emerged in his black cassock into
the sunlight and whirled away just in time. The man in the cassock glanced
about him, noticed but thought nothing of the <i>fellagha</i> bent over his
bicycle adjusting the chain, and walked quickly down the alley toward a small
unmarked car.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The spice-shopper had sweat running down his
face and his heart pounded. Close, too damn close. He had deliberately avoided
going anywhere near the Mukhabarat headquarters in Mansour just in case he ran
into that face. What the hell was the man doing as a priest in the Christian
quarter?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>God, it had been years—years since they played
together on the lawn of Mr. Hartley’s Tasisiya prep school, since he had
punched the boy on the jaw for insulting his kid brother, since they had
recited poetry in class, always excelled by Abdelkarim Badri. It had been a
long time since he had seen his old friend Hassan Rahmani, now head of Counterintelligence
for the Republic of Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was approaching Christmas, and in the deserts of
northern Saudi Arabia, three hundred thousand Americans and Europeans turned
their thoughts to home as they prepared to sit out the festival in a deeply
Moslem land. But despite the approaching celebration of the birth of Christ,
the buildup of the greatest invasion force since Normandy rolled on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The portion of desert in which the Coalition
forces lay was still due south of Kuwait. No hint had been given that
eventually half those forces would sweep much farther west.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the coastal ports the new divisions were
still pouring in. The British Fourth Armoured Brigade had joined the Desert
Rats, the Seventh, to form the First Armoured Division. The French were
boosting their contribution up to ten thousand men, including the Foreign
Legion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Americans had imported, or were about to,
the First Cavalry Division, Second and Third Armored Cavalry Regiments, the
First Mechanized Infantry Division and First and Third Armored, two divisions
of Marines, and the 82nd and 101st Airborne.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Right up on the border, where they wanted to
be, were the Saudi Task Force and Special Forces, aided by Egyptian and Syrian
divisions and other units drawn from a variety of smaller Arab nations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The northern waters of the Arabian Gulf were
almost plated with warships from the Coalition navies. Either in the Gulf or
the Red Sea on the other side of Saudi Arabia, the United States had positioned
five carrier groups, headed by the <i>Eisenhower, Independence, John F.
Kennedy, Midway</i>, and <i>Saratoga</i>, with the <i>America, Ranger</i>, and <i>Theodore
Roosevelt </i>still to come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The air power of these alone, with their
Tomcats, Hornets, Intruders, Prowlers, Avengers, and Hawkeyes, was impressive
to behold.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the Gulf the American battleship <i>Wisconsin</i>
was on station, to be joined by the <i>Missouri</i> in January.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Throughout the Gulf States and across Saudi
Arabia, every airfield worth the name was crammed with fighter, bomber, tanker,
freighter, and early-warning aircraft, all of which were already flying around
the clock, though not yet invading Iraqi air space, with the exception of the
spy planes that cruised overhead unseen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In several cases the United States Air Force
was sharing airfield space with squadrons of the British Royal Air Force. As
the aircrews shared a common language, communication was easy, informal, and
friendly. Occasionally, however, misunderstandings did occur. A notable one
concerned a secret British location known only as MMFD.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On an early training mission, a British Tornado
had been asked by the air traffic controller whether it had reached a certain
turning point. The pilot replied that he had not, he was still over MMFD.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As time went by, many American pilots heard of
this place and scoured their maps to find it. It was a puzzle for two reasons:
The British apparently spent a lot of time over it, and it was not located on
any American air map. The theory was floated that it might be a mishearing of
KKMC, which stood for King Khaled Military City, a large Saudi base. This was
discounted, and the search went on. Finally the Americans gave up. Wherever
MMFD was located, it was simply not to be found on the war maps supplied to
USAF squadrons by their planners in Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eventually the Tornado pilots admitted the
secret of MMFD. It stood for “miles and miles of fucking desert.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the ground, the soldiers were living in the
heart of MMFD. For many, sleeping under their tanks, mobile guns, and armored
cars, life was hard and, worse, boring.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were distractions, however, and one was
visiting neighboring units as the time dragged by. The Americans were equipped
with particularly good cots, for which the British lusted. By chance, the
Americans were also issued singularly revolting prepacked meals, probably
devised by a Pentagon civil servant who would have died rather than eat them
three times a day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were called MREs, meaning
Meals-Ready-to-Eat. The U.S. soldiery denied this quality in them and decided
that MRE really stood for Meals Rejected by Ethiopians. By contrast, the Brits
were eating much better, so true to the capitalist ethic, a brisk trade was
soon established between American beds and British rations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Another piece of news from the British lines
that bemused the Americans was the order placed by London’s Ministry of Defence
for half a million condoms for the soldiers in the Gulf. In the bleak deserts
of Arabia such a purchase was deemed to indicate the Brits must know something
the GIs did not.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The mystery was resolved the day before the
ground war started. The Americans had spent a hundred days cleaning their
rifles over and over again to purge them of the all-pervasive sand, dust, grit,
and gravel that endlessly blew into the ends of the barrels. The Brits whipped
off their condoms to reveal nice shiny barrels gleaming with gun oil.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other principal development that occurred
just before Christmas was the reintegration of the French contingency into the
heart of Allied planning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the early days, France had had a disaster of
a Defense Minister called Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who appeared to enjoy a keen
sympathy with Iraq and ordered the French commander to pass all Allied planning
decisions on to Paris. When this was made plain to General Schwarzkopf, he and
Sir Peter de la Billière almost burst out laughing. Monsieur Chevenement was at
that time also a leading light of the France-Iraq Friendship Society. Although
the French contingent was commanded by a fine soldier in the form of General
Michel Roquejoffre, France had to be excluded from all planning councils.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the end of the year, Pierre Joxe was
appointed French Defense Minister and at once rescinded the order. From then
on, General Roquejoffre could be taken into the confidence of the Americans and
British.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Two days before Christmas, Mike Martin received from
Jericho the answer to a question posed a week earlier. Jericho was adamant:
There had been within the previous few days a crisis cabinet meeting containing
only the inner core of Saddam Hussein’s cabinet, the Revolutionary Command
Council, and the top generals.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the meeting the question of Iraq leaving
Kuwait voluntarily had been raised. Obviously it had not been raised as a
proposal by anyone at the meeting—no one was that stupid. All recalled too well
the earlier occasion when, during the Iran-Iraq war, an Iranian suggestion that
if Saddam Hussein stepped down there could be peace had been broached. Saddam
had asked for opinions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Health Minister had suggested such a move
might be wise—as a purely temporary ploy, of course. Saddam invited the
minister into a side room, pulled out his sidearm, shot him dead, and returned
to resume the cabinet meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The matter of Kuwait had been raised in the
form of a denunciation of the United Nations for even daring to suggest the
idea. All had waited for Saddam to give a lead. He declined, sitting as he so
often did at the head of the table like a watching cobra, eyes moving from man
to man in an attempt to smoke out some hint of disloyalty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Not unnaturally, without a lead from the Rais,
the conversation had petered out. Then Saddam had begun to speak very quietly,
which was when he was at his most dangerous.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Anyone, he said, who let the thought of
admitting to such a catastrophic humiliation of Iraq in the face of the
Americans cross his mind was a man prepared to play the role of lickspittle to
America for the rest of his life. For such a man there could be no place at
this table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That had been the end of it. Everyone present
bent over backward to explain that such a thought would never, under any
circumstances, occur to any of them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then the Iraqi dictator had added something
else: Only if Iraq could win and be seen to win would it be possible to
withdraw from Iraq’s nineteenth province, he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Everyone around the table then nodded sagely,
though none could see what he was talking about.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a long report, and Mike Martin
transmitted it to the villa outside Riyadh that same night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Chip Barber and Simon Paxman pored over it for
hours. Each had decided to take a brief break from Saudi Arabia and fly home
for several days, leaving the running of Mike Martin and Jericho from the
Riyadh end in the hands of Julian Gray for the British and the local CIA Head
of Station for the Americans. There were only twenty-four days to go until the
expiration of the United Nations deadline and the start of General Chuck Horner’s
air war against Iraq. Both men wanted a short home leave, and Jericho’s
powerful report gave them the chance. They could take it with them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you think he means, ‘win and be seen
to win’?” asked Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No idea,” said Paxman. “We’ll have to get some
analysts who are better than we are to have a look at it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We too. I guess nobody will be around for the
next few days except the shop-minders. I’ll give it the way it is to Bill
Stewart, and he’ll probably have some eggheads try to add an in-depth analysis
before it goes on to the Director and the State Department.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know an egghead I’d like to have a look at
it,” said Paxman, and on that note they left for the airport to catch their
respective flights home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On Christmas Eve, seated in a discreet wine bar
in London’s West End with Simon Paxman, Dr. Terry Martin was shown the whole
text of the Jericho message and asked if he would try to work out what, if
anything, Saddam Hussein could mean by winning against America as a price for
leaving Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“By the way,” he asked Paxman, “I know it
breaks the rules of need-to-know, but I really am worried. I do these favors
for you—give me one in return. How is my brother Mike doing in Kuwait? Is he
still safe?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman stared at the doctor of Arabic studies
for several seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I can only tell you that he is no longer in
Kuwait,” he said. “And that’s more than my job is worth.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin flushed with relief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s the best Christmas present I could have.
Thank you, Simon.” He looked up and waved a waggish finger. “Just one thing—don’t
even think of sending him into Baghdad.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman had been in the business fifteen years.
He kept his face immobile, his tone light. The scholar was clearly just joking.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Really? Why not?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin was finishing his glass of wine and
failed to notice the flicker of alarm in the intelligence officer’s eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“My dear Simon, Baghdad’s the one city in the
world he mustn’t set foot in. You remember those tapes of Iraqi radio
intercepts Sean Plummer let me have? Some of the voices have been identified. I
recognized one of the names. A hell of a fluke, but I know I’m right.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Really?” said Paxman smoothly. “Tell me more.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s been a long time, of course, but I know
it was the same man. And guess what? He’s now head of Counterintelligence in
Baghdad, Saddam’s number-one spy-hunter.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hassan Rahmani,” murmured Paxman. Terry Martin
should stay off booze, even before Christmas. He can’t carry it. His tongue’s
running away with him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the one. They were at school together,
you know. We all were. Good old Mr. Hartley’s prep school. Mike and Hassan were
best mates. See? That’s why he can never be seen around Baghdad.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman left the wine bar and stared at the
dumpy figure of the Arabist heading down the street.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh shit,” he said. “Oh bloody, bloody hell.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Someone had just ruined his Christmas, and he
was about to ruin Steve Laing’s.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Edith Hardenberg had gone to Salzburg to spend the festive
season with her mother, a family tradition that went back many years.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Karim, the young Jordanian student, was able to
visit Gidi Barzilai at his safe-house apartment, where the controller for
Operation Joshua was dispensing drinks to the off-duty members of the yarid and
neviot teams working under him. Only one unfortunate was up in Salzburg,
keeping an eye on Miss Hardenberg in case she should return suddenly to the
capital.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Karim’s real name was Avi Herzog, a
twenty-nine-year-old who had been seconded to the Mossad several years earlier
from Unit 504, a branch of Army Intelligence specializing in cross-border
raids, which accounted for his fluent Arabic. Because of his good looks and the
deceptively shy and diffident manner he could affect when he wished, the Mossad
had twice used him for honeytrap operations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So how’s it going, loverboy?” asked Gidi as he
passed around the drinks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Slowly,” said Avi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t take too long. The old man wants a
result, remember.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This is one very uptight lady,” replied Avi. “Only
interested in a meeting of minds—yet.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In his cover as a student from Amman, he had
been set up in a small flat shared with one other Arab student, in fact a
member of the neviot team, a phone-tapper by trade who also spoke Arabic. This
was in case Edith Hardenberg or anyone else took it into their head to check
out where and how he lived and with whom.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The shared flat would pass any inspection—it
was littered with textbooks on engineering and strewn with Jordanian newspapers
and magazines. Both men had genuinely been enrolled in the Technical University
in case a check were made there also. It was Herzog’s flat-mate who spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Meeting of minds? Screw that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the point,” said Avi. “I can’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the laughter died down, he added:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“By the way, I’m going to want danger money.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why?” asked Gidi. “Think she’s going to bite
it off when you drop your jeans?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nope. It’s the art galleries, concerts,
operas, recitals. I could die of boredom before I get that far.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You just carry on the way you know how,
boychick. You’re only here because the Office says you’ve got something we don’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes,” said the woman member of the yarid
tracking team. “About nine inches.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s enough of that, young Yael. You can be
back on traffic duty in Hayarkon Street any time you like.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The drink, the laughter, and the banter in
Hebrew flowed. Late that evening, Yael discovered she was right. It was a good
Christmas for the Mossad team in Vienna.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“So what do you think, Terry?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Steve Laing and Simon Paxman had invited Terry
Martin to join them in one of the Firm’s apartments in Kensington. They needed
more privacy than they could get in a restaurant. It was two days before the
New Year.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Fascinating,” said Martin. “Absolutely
fascinating. This is for real? Saddam really said all this?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, if you’ll forgive my saying so, it’s a
strange telephone tap. The narrator seems to be reporting to someone else on a
meeting he attended. ... The other man on the line doesn’t seem to say a thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was simply no way the Firm was going to
tell Terry Martin how they had come by the report.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The other man’s interventions were
perfunctory,” said Laing smoothly. “Just grunts and expressions of interest.
There seemed no point in including them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But this <i>is</i> the language Saddam used?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So we understand, yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Fascinating. The first time I’ve ever seen
anything he said that was not destined for publication or a wider audience.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had in his hands not the handwritten
report by Jericho, which had been destroyed by his own brother in Baghdad as
soon as it had been read, word for word, into the tape recorder. It was a
typewritten transcript in Arabic of the text that had reached Riyadh in the
burst transmission before Christmas. He also had the Firm’s own English
translation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That last phrase,” said Paxman, who would be
heading back to Riyadh the same evening, “where he says ‘win and be seen to win’—does
that tell you anything?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course. But you know, you’re still using
the word win in its European or North American connotation. I would use the
word succeed in English.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, Terry, how does he think he can
succeed against America and the Coalition?” asked Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“By humiliation. I told you before, he must
leave America looking like a complete fool.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But he won’t pull out of Kuwait in the next
twenty days? We really need to know, Terry.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, Saddam went in there because his claims
would not be met,” said Martin. “He demanded four things: takeover of Warba and
Bubiyan Islands to have access to the sea, compensation for the excess oil he
claims Kuwait snitched from the shared oil field, an end to Kuwait’s
overproduction, and a writeoff of the fifteen-billion-dollar war debt. If he
can get these, he can pull back with honor, leaving America hanging in the
breeze. That’s winning.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Any hint that he thinks he might get them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He thinks the United Nations peacemongers
could pull the rug. He’s gambling that time is on his side, that if he can keep
spinning things out, the resolve of the UN will ebb away. He could be right.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The man doesn’t make sense,” snapped Laing. “He
has the deadline. January fifteenth, not twenty days away. He’s going to be
crushed.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Unless,” suggested Paxman, “one of the
permanent members of the Security Council comes up with a last-minute peace
plan to put the deadline on hold.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing looked gloomy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Paris or Moscow, or both,” he predicted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If it comes to war, does he still think he
could win? Beg your pardon, ‘succeed’?” asked Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes,” said Terry Martin. “But it’s back to
what I told you before—American casualties. Don’t forget, Saddam is a
back-street gunman. His constituency is not the diplomatic corridors of Cairo
and Riyadh. It’s all those alleys and bazaars crammed with Palestinians and other
Arabs who resent America, the backer of Israel. Any man who can leave America
bleeding, whatever the damage to his own country, will be the toast of those
millions.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But he can’t do it,” insisted Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He thinks he can,” Martin countered. “Look, he’s
smart enough to have worked out that in America’s eyes, America cannot lose,
must not lose. It is simply not acceptable. Look at Vietnam. The veterans came
home, and they were pelted with garbage. For America, terrible casualties at
the hands of a despised enemy are a form of loss. Unacceptable loss. Saddam can
waste fifty thousand men anytime, anyplace. He doesn’t care. Uncle Sam does. If
America takes that kind of loss, she’ll be shaken to the core. Heads have to
roll, careers to be smashed, governments to fall. The recriminations and the
self-blame would last a generation.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He can’t do that,” said Laing again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He thinks he can,” repeated Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s the gas weapon,” muttered Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe. By the bye, did you ever find out what
that phrase on the phone intercept meant?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing glanced across at Paxman. Jericho again.
There must be no mention of Jericho.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. Nobody we asked had ever heard of it. No
one could work it out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It could be important, Steve. Something else—not
gas.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Terry,” said Laing patiently, “in less than
twenty days the Americans, with us, the French, Italians, Saudis, and others,
are going to throw at Saddam Hussein the biggest air armada the world has ever
seen. Enough firepower to exceed in a further twenty days all the tonnage dropped
in the Second World War. The generals down in Riyadh are kind of busy. We
really can’t go down there and say ‘Hold everything, guys. We have a phrase in
a phone intercept we can’t work out.’ Let’s face it, it was just an excitable
man on a phone suggesting that God was on their side.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s nothing strange in that, Terry,” said
Paxman. “People going to war have claimed they had God’s support since time
began. That was all it was.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The other man told the speaker to shut up and
get off the line,” Martin reminded them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So he was busy and irritable.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He called him the son of a whore.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So he didn’t like him much.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Terry, please, leave it alone. It was just a
phrase. It’s the gas weapon. That’s what he’s counting on. All the rest of your
analysis we agree with.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin left first, the two intelligence
officers twenty minutes later. Shrugged into their coats, collars up, they went
down the sidewalk looking for a taxi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You know,” said Laing, “he’s a clever little
bugger, and I quite like him. But he really is a terrible fusspot. You’ve heard
about his private life?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A cab went by, empty, its light off. Tea break
time. Laing swore at it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, of course, the Box ran a check.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Box, or Box 500, is slang for the Security
Service, MI-5. Once, long ago, the address of MI-5 really was P.O. Box 500,
London.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, there you are then,” said Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Steve, I really don’t think that’s got
anything to do with it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing stopped and turned to his subordinate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Simon, trust me. He’s got a bee in his bonnet,
and he’s just wasting our time. Take a word of advice. Just drop the professor.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“It will be the poison gas weapon, Mr. President.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Three days after the New Year, such festivities
as there had been in the White House—and for most there had been no pause at
all—had long died away. The whole West Wing, the heart of the Bush
administration, was humming with activity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the quiet of the Oval Office, George Bush
sat behind the great desk, backed by the tall narrow windows, five inches of
pale green bulletproof glass, and beneath the seal of the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Facing him was Lieutenant General Brent
Scowcroft, the National Security Adviser.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The President glanced down at the digest of the
analyses that had just been presented to him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Everyone is agreed on this?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, sir. The stuff that just came in from
London shows their people completely concur with ours. Saddam Hussein will not
pull out of Kuwait unless he is given an out, a face-saver, which we will
ensure he does not get. For the rest, he will rely on mass gas attacks on the
Coalition ground forces, either before or during their invasion across the
border.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>George Bush was the first American President
since John F. Kennedy who had actually been in combat. He had seen American
bodies killed in action. But there was something particularly hideous,
especially foul, in the thought of young combat soldiers writhing through their
last moments of life as gas tore at their lung tissues and crippled their
central nervous systems.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And how will he launch this gas?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We believe there are four options, Mr.
President. The obvious one is by canisters launched from fighters and strike
bombers, Colin Powell has just been on the line to Chuck Horner in Riyadh.
General Horner says he needs thirty-five days of unceasing air war. After day
twenty, no Iraqi airplane will reach the border. By day thirty, no Iraqi plane
will take off for more than sixty seconds. He says he guarantees it, sir. You
can have his stars on it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the rest?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Saddam has a number of MLRS batteries. That
would seem to be the second line of possibility.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Iraq’s multilaunch rocket systems were
Soviet-built and based on the old Katyushkas used with devastating effect by
the Soviet Army in the Second World War. Now much updated, these rockets,
launched in rapid sequence from a rectangular “pack” on the back of a truck or
from a fixed position, had a range of one hundred kilometers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Naturally, Mr. President, because of their
range, they would have to be launched from within Kuwait or the Iraqi desert to
the west. We believe the J-STARs will find them on their radars and they will
be taken out. The Iraqis can camouflage them all they like, but the metal will
show up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“For the rest, Iraq has stockpiles of
gas-tipped shells for use by tanks and artillery. Range, under thirty-seven
kilometers—nineteen miles. We know the stockpiles are already on site, but at
that range it’s all desert—no cover. The Air boys are confident they can find
them and destroy them. And then there are the Scuds—they’re being taken care of
even as we speak.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the preventive measures?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They’re completed, Mr. President. In case of
an anthrax attack, every man is being inoculated. The Brits have done it too.
We are increasing production of the anti-anthrax vaccine every hour. And every
man and woman has a gas mask and a coverall gas cape. If he tries it ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The President rose, turned, and stared up at
the seal. The bald eagle, clutching its arrows, stared back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Twenty years earlier, there had been those
awful zip-up body bags coming back from Vietnam, and he knew that a supply was
even now stored in discreet unmarked containers under the Saudi sun. Even with
all the precautions, there would be patches of exposed skin, masks that could
not be reached and pulled on in time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The following year would be the reelection
campaign. But that was not the point. Win or lose, he had no intention of going
down in history as the American President who consigned tens of thousands of
soldiers to die, not as in Vietnam over nine years, but over a few weeks or
even days.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Brent ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mr. President.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“James Baker is due to see Tariq Aziz shortly.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In six days in Geneva.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ask him to come and see me, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the first week of January, Edith Hardenberg began to
enjoy herself, really enjoy herself, for the first time in years. There was a
thrill in exploring and explaining to her eager young friend the wonders of
culture that lay within her city.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Winkler Bank was permitting its staff a
four-day break to include New Year’s Day; after that, they would have to
confine their cultural outings to the evenings, which still gave the promise of
theater, concerts, and recitals, and weekends, when the museums and galleries
were still open.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They spent half a day at the Jugendstil,
admiring the Art Nouveau, and another half-day in the Sezession, where hangs
the permanent exhibition of the works of Klimt.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young Jordanian was delighted and excited,
a fund of questions pouring from him, and Edith Hardenberg caught the
enthusiasm, her eyes alight as she explained that there was another wonderful
exhibition at the Künstlerhaus that was definitely a must for the next weekend.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After the Klimt viewing, Karim took her to dine
at the Rotisserie Sirk. She protested at the expense, but her new friend explained
that his father was a wealthy surgeon in Amman and that his allowance was
generous.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Amazingly, she allowed him to pour her a glass
of wine and failed to notice when he refilled it. Her talk became more
animated, and there was a small flush on each pale cheek.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Over coffee, Karim leaned forward and placed
his hand on hers. She looked flustered and glanced hastily around to see if
anyone had noticed, but no one bothered. She withdrew her hand, but quite
slowly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the end of the week, they had visited four
of the cultural treasures she had in mind, and when they walked back through
the cold darkness toward her car after an evening at the Musikverein, he took
her gloved hand in his and kept it there. She did not pull it away, feeling the
warmth seep through the cotton glove.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are very kind to do all this for me,” he
said gravely. “I am sure it must be boring for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, no, it’s not at all,” she said earnestly. “I
enjoy seeing and hearing all these beautiful things. I’m so glad you do too.
Quite soon, you’ll be an expert on European art and culture.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they reached her car, he smiled down at
her, took her wind-chilled face between both his bare but surprisingly hot
hands, and kissed her lightly on the lips.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Danke</i>, Edith.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then he walked away. She drove herself home as
usual, but her hands were trembling and she nearly hit a tram.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Secretary of State James Baker met Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz in Geneva on January 9. It was not a long meeting, and it was not a
friendly one. It was not intended to be. There was a single English-Arabic
interpreter present, though Tariq Aziz’s English was perfectly up to the task
of understanding the American, who spoke slowly and with great clarity. His
message was quite simple.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If, during the course of any hostilities that
may occur between our countries, your government chooses to employ the
internationally banned weapon of poison gas, I am authorized to inform you and
President Hussein that my country will use a nuclear device. We will, in short,
nuke Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The dumpy, gray-haired Iraqi took in the sense
of the message but at first could not believe it. For one thing, no man in his
senses would dare convey such a barefaced threat to the Rais. He had a habit,
in the manner of former Babylonian kings, of taking out his displeasure on the
message-bearer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For another, he was not sure at first that the
American was serious. The fallout, the collateral damage of a nuclear bomb,
would not be confined to Baghdad, surely? It would devastate half the Middle
East, would it not?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Tariq Aziz, as he headed home for Baghdad a
deeply troubled man, did not know three things.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One was that the so-called “theater” nuclear
bombs of modern science are a far cry from the Hiroshima bomb of 1945. The new,
limited-damage “clean” bombs are called thus because although their
heat-and-blast damage is as appalling as ever, the radioactivity they leave
behind is of extremely short duration.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second thing was that within the hull of
the battleship <i>Wisconsin</i>, then stationed in the Gulf and joined by the <i>Missouri</i>,
were three very special steel-and-concrete caissons, strong enough, if the ship
went down, not to degrade for ten thousand years. Inside them were three
Tomahawk cruise missiles the United States hoped never to have to use.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The third was that the Secretary of State was
not joking at all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>General Sir Peter de la Billière walked alone in the
darkness of the desert night, accompanied only by the crunch of sand beneath
his feet and his troubled private thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A lifelong professional soldier and a combat
veteran, his tastes were as ascetic as his frame was spare. Unable to take much
pleasure in the luxury offered by cities, he felt more at home and at ease in
camps and bivouacs and the company of fellow soldiers. Like others before him, he
appreciated the Arabian desert—its vast horizons, blazing heat, and numbing
cold, and many times its awesome silence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, on a visit to the front lines—one
of the treats he permitted himself as often as possible—he had walked away from
St. Patrick’s Camp, leaving behind him the brooding Challenger tanks beneath
their nets, crouching animals patiently waiting for their time, and the hussars
preparing the evening meal beneath them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By then a close friend of General Schwarzkopf
and privy to all the planning staff’s innermost councils, the general knew that
war was coming. Less than a week before the expiration of the United Nations
deadline, there was not a hint that Saddam Hussein had any intention of pulling
out of Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What worried him that night under the stars of
the Saudi desert was that he could not understand what the tyrant of Baghdad
thought he was up to. As a soldier, the British general liked to understand his
enemy, to plumb his intentions, his motivations, his tactics, his overall strategy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Personally, he had nothing but contempt for the
man in Baghdad. The amply documented files depicting genocide, torture, and
murder revolted him. Saddam was not a soldier, never had been, and what real
military talent he had had in his army he had largely wasted by overruling his
generals or having the best of them executed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That was not the problem; the problem was that
Saddam Hussein had clearly taken overall command of every aspect—political and
military—and nothing he did made a fraction of sense.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had invaded Kuwait at the wrong time and for
the wrong reasons. That done, he had blown away his chances of reassuring his
fellow Arabs that he was open to diplomacy, susceptible to reason, and that the
problem could be resolved within the ambit of inter-Arab negotiations. Had he
taken that road, he could probably have counted quite rightly on the oil
continuing to flow, and the West gradually losing interest as the inter-Arab
conferences bogged down for years.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was the dictator’s own stupidity that had
brought in the West, and to cap it, the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, with its
multiple rapes and brutality and its attempt to use Westerners as human
shields, had guaranteed his utter isolation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the early days Saddam Hussein had had the
rich oil fields of northeastern Saudi Arabia at his mercy, and he had hung
back. With his army and air force under good generalship, he could even have
reached Riyadh and dictated his terms. He had failed, and Desert Shield had
been put in place while he masterminded one public relations disaster after
another in Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He might be streetwise, but in all other
matters he was a strategic buffoon. And yet, reasoned the British general, how
could any man be so stupid?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even in the face of the air power now ranged
against him, Saddam Hussein was making every single wrong move, politically and
militarily. Had he no idea what rage from the skies was about to be visited on
Iraq? Did he really not comprehend the level of the firepower that was about to
set his armory back by ten years in five weeks?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The general stopped and stared across the
desert toward the north. There was no moon that night, but the stars in the
desert are so bright that dim outlines can be seen by their light alone. The
land was flat, running away to the labyrinth of sand walls, fire ditches,
minefields, barbed-wire entanglements, and gullies that made up the Iraqi
defensive line, through which the American engineers of the Big Red One would
blast a path to let the Challengers roll.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And yet the tyrant of Baghdad had one single
ace of which the general knew and which he feared: Saddam could simply pull out
of Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Time was not on the Allies’ side; it belonged
to Iraq. On March 15 the Moslem feast of Ramadan would begin. For a month no
food or water should pass the lips of any Moslem between sunrise and sunset.
The nights were for eating and drinking. That made going to war, for a Moslem
army in Ramadan, almost impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After April 15, the desert would become an
inferno, with temperatures rising to 130 degrees. Pressure would build up back
home to bring the boys out; by summer, the pressure at home and the misery of
the desert would become irresistible. The Allies would have to pull out and,
having done so, would never come back again like this. The Coalition was a
one-time-only phenomenon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So March 15 was the limit. Working backward,
the ground war might last up to twenty days. It would have to start, if at all,
by February 23. But Chuck Horner needed his thirty-five days of air war to
smash the Iraqi weapons, regiments, and defenses. January 17—that was the
latest possible date.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Supposing Saddam pulled out? He would leave
half a million Allies looking like fools, strung out in the desert, hanging in
the wire, with nowhere to go but back. Yet Saddam was adamant—he would not pull
out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What was that crazy man up to? the general
asked himself again. Was he waiting for something, some divine intervention of
his own imagining, that would crush his enemies and leave him triumphant?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a yell out of the tank camp behind
him. He turned. The commanding officer of the Queen’s Royal Irish Hussars,
Arthur Denaro, was calling him to supper. Burly, jovial Arthur Denaro, who
would be in the first tank through that gap one day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He smiled and began to walk back. It would be
good to squat in the sand with the men, shoveling baked beans and bread out of
a mess tin, listening to the voices in the glow of the fire, the flat twang of
Lancashire, the rolling burr of Hampshire, and the soft brogue of Ireland; to
laugh at the leg-pulling and the jokes, the crude vocabulary of men who used
blunt English to say exactly what they meant, and with good humor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lord rot that man in the north. What the hell
was he waiting for?</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942765">Chapter 14</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The answer to the British general’s puzzlement lay on a
padded trolley under the fluorescent lights of the factory, eighty feet beneath
the desert of Iraq, where it had been built.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An engineer stepped rapidly back to stand at
attention as the door to the room opened. Only five men came in before the two
armed guards from the presidential security detail, the Amn-al-Khass, closed
the door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Four of the men deferred to the one in the
center. He wore, as usual, his combat uniform over gleaming black calf-boots,
his personal sidearm at his waist, green cotton kerchief covering the triangle
between jacket and throat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of the other four was the personal
bodyguard who, even in here, where everyone had been checked five times for
concealed weapons, would not leave his side. Between the Rais and his bodyguard
stood his son-in-law, Hussein Kamil, head of the Ministry of Industry and
Military Industrialization, the MIMI. As in so many things, it was the MIMI
that had taken over from the Ministry of Defense.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the other side of the President stood the
mastermind of the program, Dr. Jaafar Al-Jaafar, Iraq’s nuclear genius. Beside
him, but a bit to the rear, stood Dr. Salah Siddiqui. Where Jaafar was the
physicist, Siddiqui was the engineer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The steel of their baby gleamed dully in the
white light. It was fourteen feet long and just over three feet in diameter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the rear, four feet were taken up by an
elaborate impact-absorbing device that would be shed as soon as the projectile
had been launched. Even the remainder of the ten-foot-long casing was in fact a
sabot, a sleeve in eight identical sections. Tiny explosive bolts would cause
this to break away as the projectile departed on its mission, leaving the
slimmer, two-foot-diameter core to carry on alone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sabot was only there to fill out the
twenty-four-inch projectile to the thirty-nine inches needed to occupy the bore
of the launcher, and to protect the four rigid tail fins it concealed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Iraq did not possess the telemetry necessary to
operate movable fins by radio signals from the earth, but the rigid fins would
serve to stabilize the projectile in flight and prevent it from wobbling or
tumbling.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the front, the nose cone was on ultratough
maraging steel and needle-pointed. This too would eventually become
dispensable.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When a rocket, having entered inner space on its
flight, reenters the earth’s atmosphere, the air becoming denser on the
downward flight creates a friction heat enough to melt the nose cone away. That
is why reentering astronauts need that heat shield—to prevent their capsule
from being incinerated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The device the five Iraqis surveyed that night
was similar. The steel nose cone would ease its flight upward but could not
survive reentry. Were it retained, the melting metal would bend and buckle,
causing the falling body to sway, swerve, turn broadside onto the rushing air,
and burn up. The steel nose was designed to blow apart at the apogee of flight,
revealing beneath it a reentry cone, shorter, blunter, and made of carbon
fiber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the days when Dr. Gerald Bull was alive, he
had tried to buy, on behalf of Baghdad, a British firm in Northern Ireland
called LearFan. It was an aviation company gone bust. It had tried to build
executive jets with many components made of carbon fiber. What interested Dr.
Bull and Baghdad was not executive airplanes, but the carbon-fiber
filament-winding machines at LearFan.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Carbon fiber is extremely heat-resistant, but
it is also very hard to work. The carbon is first reduced to a sort of wool,
from which a thread or filament is spun. The thread is laid and cross-plaited
many times over a mold, then bonded into a shell to create the desired shape.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because carbon fiber is vital in rocket
technology, and that technology is classified, great care is taken in
monitoring the export of such machines. When the British intelligence people
learned where the LearFan equipment was destined and consulted Washington, the
deal had been killed. It was then assumed that Iraq would not acquire her
carbon-filament technology.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The experts were wrong. Iraq tried another
tack, which worked. An American supplier of air-conditioning and insulation
products was unwittingly persuaded to sell to an Iraqi front company the
machinery for spinning rock-wool. In Iraq this was modified by Iraqi engineers
to spin carbon fiber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Between the impact-absorber at the back and the
nose cone rested the work of Dr. Siddiqui—a small, workaday, but perfectly
functioning atomic bomb, to be triggered on the gun-barrel principle, using the
catalysts of lithium and polonium to create the blizzard of neutrons necessary
to start the chain reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside the engineering of Dr. Siddiqui was the
real triumph, a spherical ball and a tubular plug, between them weighing
thirty-five kilograms and produced under the aegis of Dr. Jaafar. Both were of
pure enriched uranium-235.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A slow smile of satisfaction spread beneath the
thick black moustache. The President advanced and ran a forefinger down the
burnished steel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It will work? It will really work?” he
whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, <i>Sayid Rais</i>,” said the physicist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The head in the black beret nodded slowly
several times.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are to be congratulated, my brothers.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beneath the projectile, on a wooden stand, was
a simple plaque. It read: Qubth-ut-Allah.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Tariq Aziz had contemplated long and hard as to how, if at
all, he could convey to his President the American threat so brutally put
before him in Geneva.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Twenty years they had known each other, twenty
years during which the Foreign Minister had served his master with doglike
devotion, always taking his side during those early struggles within the Ba’ath
Party hierarchy when there had been other claimants for power, always following
his personal judgment that the utter ruthlessness of the man from Tikrit would
triumph, and always being proved right.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had climbed the greasy pole of power in a Middle
East dictatorship together, the one always in the shadow of the other. The
gray-haired, stubby Aziz had managed to overcome the initial disadvantage of
his higher education and grasp of two European languages by sheer blind
obedience.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Leaving the actual violence to others, he had
watched and approved, as all must do in the court of Saddam Hussein, as purge
after purge had seen columns of Army officers and once-trusted Party men
disgraced and taken away for execution, a sentence often preceded by agonized
hours with the tormentors at Abu Ghraib.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had seen good generals removed and shot for
trying to stand up for the men under their command, and he knew that real
conspirators had died more horribly than he cared to imagine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had watched the Al-Juburi tribe, once so
powerful in the Army that no one dared to offend them, stripped and humbled,
the survivors brought to heel and obedience. He had stayed silent as Saddam’s
half-brother Ali Hassan Majid, then Interior Minister, had masterminded the
genocide of the Kurds, not simply at Halabja but at fifty other towns and
villages, wiped away with bombs, artillery, and gas.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Tariq Aziz, like all those in the entourage of
the Rais, knew that there was nowhere else for him to go. If anything happened
to his master, he too would be finished for all time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Unlike some around the throne, he was too smart
to believe that this was a popular regime. His real fear was not the foreigners
but the awful revenge of the people of Iraq if ever the veil of Saddam’s
protection were removed from him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His problem that January 11, as he waited for
the personal appointment to which he had been summoned on his return from
Europe, was how to phrase the American threat without attracting the inevitable
rage onto himself. The Rais, he knew, could easily suspect that it was he, the
Foreign Minister, who had really suggested the threat to the Americans. There
is no logic to paranoia, only gut instinct, sometimes right and sometimes
wrong. Many innocent men had died, and their families with them, on the basis
of some inspirational suspicion by the Rais.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two hours later, returning to his car, he was
relieved, smiling and puzzled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The reason for his relief was easy; his
President had proved to be relaxed and genial. He had listened with approval to
Tariq Aziz’s glowing report of his mission to Geneva, of the widespread
sympathy he detected in all those he spoke to with regard to Iraq’s position,
and of the general anti-American feeling that appeared to be growing in the
West.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had nodded understandingly as Tariq heaped
blame on the American warmongers, and when, finally consumed with his own sense
of outrage, he mentioned what James Baker had actually said to him, the awaited
explosion of rage from the Rais had not come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While others around the table glowered and
fumed, Saddam Hussein had continued to nod and smile.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Foreign Minister was smiling as he left
because at the last his Rais had actually congratulated him on his European
mission. The fact that, by any normal diplomatic standards, that mission had
been a disaster—rebuffed on every side, treated with freezing courtesy by his
hosts, unable to dent the resolve of the Coalition ranged against his country—did
not seem to matter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His puzzlement stemmed from something the Rais
had said at the end of the audience. It had been an aside, a muttered remark to
the Foreign Minister alone as the President had seen him to the door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Rafeek</i>, dear Comrade, do not worry.
Soon I shall have a surprise for the Americans. Not yet. But if the Beni el
Kalb ever try to cross the border, I shall respond not with gas, but with the
Fist of God.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Tariq Aziz had nodded in agreement, even though
he did not know what the Rais was talking about. With others, he found out
twenty-four hours later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The morning of January 12 saw the last meeting of the full
Revolutionary Command Council to be held in the Presidential Palace, at the
corner of July 14 Street and Kindi Street. A week later it was bombed to
rubble, but the bird inside was long flown.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As usual, the summons to the meeting came at
the last moment. No matter how high one rose in the hierarchy, no matter how
trusted one might be, no one but a tiny handful of family, intimates, and
personal bodyguards ever knew exactly where the Rais would be at a given hour
on any day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If he was still alive at all after seven major,
serious attempts at assassination, it was because of his obsession with
personal security.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Neither Counterintelligence nor the Secret
Police of Omar Khatib, and certainly not the Army; not even the Republican
Guard were entrusted with that security. That task fell to the Amn-al-Khass.
Young they might be, most barely out of their teens, but their loyalty was
fanatical and absolute. Their commander was the Rais’s own son Kusay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No conspirator could ever know upon what road
the Rais would be traveling, when, or in what vehicle. His visits to army bases
or industrial installations were always surprises, not only to the visited but
also to those around him. Even in Baghdad he flitted from location to location on
a whim, sometimes spending a few days in the palace, at other times retiring to
his bunker behind and beneath the Rashid Hotel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Every plate set before him had to be tasted
first, and the food-taster was the first-born son of the chef. Every drink came
from a bottle with an unbroken seal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That morning the summons to the meeting at the
palace came to each member of the RCC by special messenger one hour before the
meeting. No time was thus left for preparations for an assassination.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The limousines swerved through the gate,
deposited their charges, and went away to a special parking garage. Each member
of the RCC passed through a metal-detecting arch; no personal sidearms were
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they were assembled in the large
conference room with its T-shaped table, there were thirty-three of them. Eight
sat at the top of the T, flanking the empty throne at the center. The rest
faced each other down the length of the stem of the T.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Seven of those present were related to the Rais
by blood and three more by marriage. These plus eight more were from Tikrit or
its immediate surroundings. All were long-standing members of the Ba’ath Party.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ten of the thirty-three were cabinet ministers
and nine were Army or Air Force generals. Saadi Tumah Abbas, former commander
of the Republican Guard, had been promoted to Defense Minister that very
morning and sat beaming on the top table. He had replaced Abd Al-Jabber
Shenshall, the renegade Kurd who had long since thrown in his lot with the
butcher of his own people.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Among the Army generals were Mustafa Radi for
the Infantry, Farouk Ridha of the Artillery, Ali Musuli of the Engineers, and
Abdullah Kadiri of the Armored Corps.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the far end of the table were the three men
controlling the intelligence apparatus: Dr. Ubaidi of the Foreign Intelligence
arm of the Mukhabarat, Hassan Rahmani of Counterintelligence, and Omar Khatib
of the Secret Police.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the Rais entered, everyone rose and
clapped. He smiled, took his chair, bade them be seated, and began his
statement. They were not here to discuss anything; they were here to be told
something.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only the son-in-law, Hussein Kamil, showed no
surprise when the Rais made his peroration. When, after forty minutes of speech
invoking the unbroken series of triumphs that had marked his leadership, he
gave them his news, the immediate reaction was of stunned silence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That Iraq had been trying for years, they knew.
That fruition in this one area of technology that alone seemed capable of
inspiring a thrill of fear throughout the world and awe even among the mighty
Americans had been achieved—now, on the very threshold of war—seemed
unbelievable. Divine intervention. But the Divinity was not in heaven above; he
sat right here, with them, smiling quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was Hussein Kamil, forewarned, who rose and
led the ovation. The others scrambled to follow, each fearing to be last to his
feet or most subdued in his applause. Then no one was prepared to be first to
stop.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he returned to his office two hours later,
Hassan Rahmani, the urbane and cosmopolitan head of Counterintelligence,
cleared his desk, ordered no interruptions, and sat at his desk with a strong
black coffee. He needed to think, and think deeply.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As with everyone else in that room, the news
had shaken him. At a stroke the balance of power in the Middle East had
changed, even though no one else yet knew. After the Rais, who with raised
hands called with admirable self-deprecation for the ovation to cease, had
resumed his chairmanship, every man in the room had been sworn to silence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This Rahmani could understand. Despite the
raging euphoria that had enveloped them all as they left and in which he had
unstintingly joined, he could foresee major problems.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No device of this kind was worth a jot unless
your friends—and more important, your enemies—knew that you had it. Then only
did potential enemies come crawling as friends.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Some nations who had developed the weapon had
simply announced the fact with a major test and let the rest of the world work
out the consequences. Others, like Israel and South Africa, had simply hinted
at what they possessed but never confirmed, leaving the world and particularly
the neighbors to guess. Sometimes that worked better; imaginations ran riot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But that, Rahmani became convinced, would
simply not work for Iraq. If what he had been told was true—and he was not
convinced that the whole exercise was not another ploy, counting on an eventual
leak to gain another stay of execution—then no one outside Iraq would believe
it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The only way for Iraq to deter would be to
prove it. This the Rais apparently now refused to do. There were, of course,
major problems to proving any such claim.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To test on home territory would be out of the
question, utter madness. To send a ship deep into the southern Indian Ocean,
abandon it, and let the test happen there might have been possible once, but
not now. All ports were firmly blockaded. But a team from the United Nations
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna could be invited to examine and
satisfy themselves that this was no lie. After all, the IAEA had been visiting
almost yearly for a decade and had always been consummately fooled as to what
was going on. Given visual evidence, they would have to believe their own eyes
and tests, eat humble pie over their past gullibility, and confirm the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Yet he, Rahmani, had just heard that that route
was formally forbidden. Why? Because it was all a lie? Because the Rais had
something else in mind? And more important, what was in it for him, Rahmani?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For months he had counted on Saddam Hussein to
bluster his way into a war he could not win; now he had done it. Rahmani had
counted on the defeat culminating in the American-engineered downfall of the
Rais and his own elevation in the American-sponsored successor regime. Now
things had changed. He needed, he realized, time to think, to work out how best
to play this amazing new card.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That evening, when darkness had fallen, a chalk sign
appeared on a wall behind the Chaldean Church of St. Joseph in the Area of the
Christians. It resembled a figure eight on its side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The citizens of Baghdad trembled that night.
Despite the ceaseless blast of propaganda on the local Iraqi radio and the
blind faith of many that it was all true, there were others who quietly
listened to the BBC World Service in Arabic, prepared in London but broadcast
out of Cyprus, and knew that the Beni Naji were telling the truth. War was
coming.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The assumption in the city was that the
Americans would start with the carpet-bombing of Baghdad, an assumption that went
right up to the Presidential Palace itself. There would be massive civilian
casualties.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The regime assumed this but did not mind. In
high places the calculation was that the global effect of such massive
slaughter of civilians in their homes would cause a worldwide revulsion against
the United States, forcing her to desist and depart. That was why such a heavy
foreign press contingent was still allowed and indeed encouraged to occupy the
Rashid Hotel. Guides were on standby to hurry the foreign TV cameras to the
scenes of the genocide as soon as it started.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The subtlety of this argument somehow escaped
those who were actually living in the homes of Baghdad. Many had already fled,
the non-Iraqis heading for the Jordanian border to swell the five-month-long
tide of refugees from Kuwait, the Iraqis seeking sanctuary in the countryside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No one suspected, including the millions of
couch potatoes glued to their screens across the United States and Europe, the
true level of sophistication that was now within the grasp of the lugubrious
Chuck Horner down in Riyadh. Nobody then could envisage that most of the
targets would be selected from a menu prepared by the cameras of satellites in
space and demolished by laser-guided bombs that rarely hit what they were not
aimed at.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What the citizens of Baghdad did know, as the
truth gleaned from the BBC filtered through the bazaars and markets, was that
four days from midnight January 12, the deadline to quit Kuwait would expire
and the American warplanes would come. So the city was quiet in expectation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin pedaled his bicycle slowly out of
Shurja Street and around the back of the church. He saw the chalk mark on the
wall as he pedaled by, and went on. At the end of the alley he paused, stepped
off the bicycle, and spent some time adjusting the chain while he looked back
the way he had come to see if there was any movement behind him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>None. No shifting of the feet of the Secret
Police in their doorways, no heads poking over the skyline of the roofs. He
pedaled back, reached out with the damp cloth, erased the mark, and rode away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The figure eight meant that a message awaited
him under the flagstone in the abandoned courtyard off Abu Nawas Street, down
by the river barely half a mile away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As a boy he had played down there, running
along the quaysides with Hassan Rahmani and Abdelkarim Badri, where the vendors
cooked the delicious <i>mosgouf</i> over beds of camelthorn embers, selling the
tender portions of the Tigris river carp to passersby.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now the shops were closed, the tea houses
shuttered; few people wandered along the quays as they used to. The silence
served him well. At the top of Abu Nawas he saw a group of AMAM plainclothes
guards, but they took no notice of the <i>fellagha</i> pedaling on his master’s
business. He was heartened by the sight of them; the AMAM was nothing if not
clumsy. If they were going to stake out a dead-letter box, they would not put a
group of men so obviously at the head of the street. Their stake-out would be
an attempt at sophistication, but flawed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The message was there. The brick went back into
its place in a second, the folded paper into the crotch of his underpants.
Minutes later, he was crossing the Ahrar Bridge over the Tigris, back from
Risafa into Karch, and on to the Soviet diplomat’s house in Mansour.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In nine weeks his life had settled down in the
walled villa. The Russian cook and her husband treated him fairly, and he had
picked up a smattering of their language. He shopped every day for fresh
produce, which gave him good reason to service all his dead-letter boxes. He
had transmitted fourteen messages to the unseen Jericho and had received
fifteen from him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eight times he had been stopped by the AMAM,
but each time his humble demeanor, his bicycle and basket of vegetables, fruit,
coffee, spices, and groceries, plus his letter from the diplomatic household
and his visible poverty had caused him to be sent on his way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He could not know what war plans were shaping
up in Riyadh, but he had to write all the questions and queries for Jericho in
his own Arabic script after listening to them on the incoming tapes, and he had
to read Jericho’s answers in order to send them back in burst transmissions to
Simon Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As a soldier, he could only estimate that
Jericho’s information, political and military, had to be invaluable to a
commanding general preparing to attack Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had already acquired an oil heater for his
shack and a kerosene lamp to light it. Hessian sacks from the market now made
curtains for all the windows, and the crunch of feet on the gravel warned him
if anyone approached the door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, he returned gratefully to the
warmth of his home, bolted the door, made sure all the curtains covered every
square inch of the windows, lit his lamp, and read Jericho’s latest message. It
was shorter than usual, but that did not lessen its impact. Martin read it
twice to make sure that even he had not suddenly lost his grasp of Arabic,
muttered “Jesus Christ,” and removed his loose tiles to reveal the tape
recorder.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lest there be any misunderstanding, he read the
message slowly and carefully in both Arabic and English into the tape machine
before switching the controls to speed-wind and reducing his five-minute
message to one and a half seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He transmitted it at twenty minutes after
midnight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Because he knew there was a transmission window between
fifteen and thirty minutes after twelve that night, Simon Paxman had not
bothered to go to bed. He was playing cards with one of the radio men when the
message came in. The second radio operator brought the news from the
communications room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’d better come and listen to this <i>now</i>,
Simon,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Although the SIS operation in Riyadh involved a
lot more than four men, the running of Jericho was regarded as so secret that
only Paxman, the Head of Station Julian Gray, and two radio men were involved.
Their three rooms had been virtually sealed off from the rest of the villa.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Simon Paxman listened to the voice on the big
tape machine in the radio shack, which was in fact a converted bedroom. Martin
spoke in Arabic first, giving the literal handwritten message from Jericho
twice, then his own translation twice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As he listened, Paxman felt a great cold hand
moving deep in his stomach. Something had gone wrong, badly wrong. What he was
hearing simply could not be. The other two men stood in silence beside him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Is it him?” asked Paxman urgently as soon as
the message had finished. His first thought was that Martin had been taken and
the voice was that of an impostor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s him—I checked the ossy. There’s no doubt
it’s him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Speech patterns have varying tones and rhythms,
highs and lows, cadences that can be recorded on an oscilloscope that reduces
them to a series of lines on a screen, like a heart monitor in a cardiac unit.
Every human voice is slightly different, no matter how good the mimic. Before
leaving for Baghdad, Mike Martin’s voice had been recorded on such a machine.
Later transmissions out of Baghdad had endured the same fate, in case the
slowing-down and speeding-up, together with any distortion by tape machine or satellite
transmission, caused distortions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The voice that came from Baghdad that night
checked with the recorded voice. It was Martin speaking and no one else.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman’s second fear was that Martin had been
caught, tortured, and turned, that he was now broadcasting under duress. He
rejected the idea as very unlikely.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were preagreed words, a pause, a
hesitation, a cough, that would warn the listeners in Riyadh if ever he were
not transmitting as a free agent. Besides, his previous broadcast had been only
three days earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Brutal the Iraqi Secret Police might be, but
they were not quick. And Martin was tough. A man broken and turned at such
speed would be shattered, a tortured wreck, and it would show in the speech
delivery.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That meant Martin was on the level—the message
he had read was precisely what he had received that night from Jericho. Which
left more imponderables. Either Jericho was right, mistaken, or lying.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Get Julian,” Paxman told one of the radio men.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While the man went to fetch the British Head of
Station from his bed upstairs, Paxman rang the private line of his American
counterpart, Chip Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Chip, better get your backside over here—fast,”
he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The CIA man came awake fast. Something in the
Englishman’s voice told him this was no time for sleepy banter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Problem, ol’ buddy?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the way it looks from here,” admitted
Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber was across the city and into the SIS
house in thirty minutes, sweater and trousers over his pajamas. It was one <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By then, Paxman had the tape in English and
Arabic, plus a transcript in both languages. The two radio men, who had worked
for years in the Middle East, were fluent and confirmed Martin’s translation
was quite accurate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He has to be joking,” breathed Barber when he
heard the tape.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman ran through the checks he had already
made for authenticity of Martin’s speaking voice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, Simon,” said Barber, “this is just
Jericho reporting what he <i>claims</i> he heard Saddam say this morning—sorry,
yesterday morning. Chances are, Saddam’s lying. Let’s face it, he lies like he
breathes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lie or not, this was no matter to be dealt with
in Riyadh. The local SIS and CIA stations might supply their generals with
tactical and even strategic military information from Jericho, but politics
went to London and Washington. Barber checked his watch: seven <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> in Washington.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They’ll be mixing their cocktails by now,” he
said. “Better make ’em strong, boys. I’ll get this to Langley right away.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Cocoa and biscuits in London,” said Paxman. “I’ll
have this to Century. Let them sort it out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber left to send his copy of the
transmission in heavily encrypted code to Bill Stewart, with an urgency rating
of “flash,” the highest known. That would mean that wherever he was, the cipher
people would find him and tell him to go to a secure line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman did the same for Steve Laing, who would
be awakened in the middle of the night and told to leave his warm bed to step
into a freezing night and head back to London.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was one last thing Paxman could do, which
he did. Martin had a transmission window for listening only, and it was at four
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> Paxman waited up and sent his man in
Baghdad a very short but very explicit message. It said Martin should make no
attempt until further notice to approach any of his six dead-letter boxes. Just
in case.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Karim, the Jordanian student, was making slow but steady
progress in his courtship of Fräulein Edith Hardenberg. She allowed him to hold
her hand when they walked through the streets of Old Vienna, the sidewalks
crackling with frost beneath their feet. She even admitted to herself that she
found the hand-holding pleasant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the second week of January she obtained
tickets at the Burgtheater—Karim paid. The performance was of a play by
Grillparzer, <i>Gygus und sein Ring</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She explained excitedly before they went in
that it was about an old king with several sons, and the one to whom he
bequeathed his ring would be the successor. Karim sat through the performance
entranced and asked for several explanations in the text, to which he referred constantly
during the play.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During the intermission Edith was happy to
answer them. Later, Avi Herzog would tell Barzilai it was all as exciting as
watching paint dry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re a philistine,” said the Mossad man. “You
have no culture.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m not here for my culture,” said Avi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then get on with it, boy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On Sunday Edith, a devout Catholic, went to
morning mass at the Votivkirche. Karim explained that as a Moslem he could not
accompany her but would wait at a café across the square.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Afterward, over coffee that he deliberately
laced with a slug of schnapps that brought a pink flush to her cheeks, he
explained the differences and similarities between Christianity and Islam—the
common worship of the one true God, the line of patriarchs and prophets, the
teachings of the holy books and the moral codes. Edith was fearful but
fascinated. She wondered if listening to all this might imperil her immortal
soul, but she was amazed to learn that she had been wrong in thinking Moslems
bowed down to idols.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I would like dinner,” said Karim three days
later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, yes, but you spend too much on me,” said
Edith. She found she could gaze into his young face and his soft brown eyes
with pleasure, while constantly warning herself that the ten-year age gap
between them made anything more than a platonic friendship quite ridiculous.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not in a restaurant.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where then?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Will you cook a meal for me, Edith? You can
cook? Real Viennese food?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She went bright red at the thought. Each
evening, unless she was going alone to a concert, she prepared herself a modest
snack that she ate in the small alcove of her flat that served as a dining
area. But yes, she thought, she <i>could</i> cook. It had been so long.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Besides, she argued with herself, he had taken
her to several expensive meals in restaurants ... and he was an extremely
well-brought-up and courteous young man. Surely there could be no harm in it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>To say that the Jericho report of the night of January
12-13 caused consternation in certain covert circles in London and Washington
would be an understatement. Controlled panic would be nearer the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of the problems was the tiny circle of
people who knew of Jericho’s existence, let alone the details. The need-to-know
principle may sound persnickety or even obsessive, but it works for a reason.
All agencies feel an obligation to an asset working for them in a very
high-risk situation, no matter how ignoble that asset may be as a human being.
The fact that Jericho was clearly a mercenary and no high-minded ideologue was
not the point. The fact that he was cynically betraying his country and its
government was irrelevant. The government of Iraq was perceived to be repulsive
anyway, so one rogue was playing traitor to another bunch.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The point was, apart from his obvious value and
the fact that his information might well save Allied lives on the battlefield,
Jericho was a high-value asset, and both the agencies running him had kept his
very existence known only to a tiny circle of initiates. No government
ministers, no politicians, no civil servants, and no soldiers had been formally
told that any Jericho existed. His product therefore had been disguised in a
variety of ways. A whole range of cover stories had been devised to explain
where this torrent of information was coming from.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Military dispositions were supposed to stem
from a series of defections by Iraqi soldiers from the Kuwait theater,
including a nonexistent major being extensively debriefed at a secret
intelligence facility in the Middle East but outside Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Scientific and technical information regarding
weapons of mass destruction was said to have been gleaned from an Iraqi science
graduate who had defected to the British after studying at Imperial College,
London, and falling in love with an English girl, and an intensive second
run-through of European technicians who had worked inside Iraq between 1985 and
1990.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Political intelligence was attributed to a mix
of refugees pouring out of Iraq, covert radio messages from occupied Kuwait,
and brilliant signals intelligence and electronic intelligence—sigint and elint—listening-in,
and aerial surveillance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But how to explain a direct report of Saddam’s
own words, however bizarre their claim, conducted within a closed meeting
inside his own palace, without admitting to an agent in the highest circles of
Baghdad?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The dangers of making such an admission were
appalling. For one thing, there are leaks. There are leaks all the time.
Cabinet documents leak, civil service memoranda leak, and interdepartmental
messages leak.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Politicians, so far as the covert community is
concerned, are the worst. To believe the nightmares of the master spooks, they
talk to their wives, girlfriends, boyfriends, hairdressers, drivers, and
bartenders. They even talk confidentially to each other with a waiter bending
over the table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Add to that the fact that Washington and London
have press and other media veterans whose investigative talents make the FBI
and Scotland Yard seem slow on the uptake, and one has a problem explaining
away Jericho’s product without admitting to a Jericho.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, London still had hundreds of Iraqi
students—some certainly agents of Dr. Ismail Ubaidi’s Foreign Intelligence arm
of the Mukhabarat—prepared to report back anything they saw or heard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not just a question of someone denouncing
Jericho by name; that would be impossible. But one hint that information had
come out of Baghdad that should not have come, and Rahmani’s
counterintelligence net would go into overdrive to detect and isolate the
source. At best, that could ensure Jericho’s future silence as he clammed up to
protect himself; at worst, his capture.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As the countdown for the start of the air war
rolled on, the two agencies recontacted all their former experts in the matter
of nuclear physics and asked for a rapid reassessment of the information
already given. Was there, after all, any conceivable possibility that Iraq
might have a greater and faster isotope separation facility than previously
thought?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In America experts at Sandia, Lawrence
Livermore, and Los Alamos were consulted again and in Britain experts at
Harwell and Aldermaston. Department Z at Livermore, the people who constantly
monitor Third World nuclear proliferation, was especially pressed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The experts came back, rather testily, to
reconfirm their advice. Even taking a worst-case scenario, they said—assuming
not one but two entire gas diffusion centrifuge cascades operating not for one
but for two years—there was no way in creation Iraq could have more than half
the uranium-235 she would need for a single medium-yield device.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That left the agencies with a menu of options.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saddam was mistaken because he had been lied to
himself. Conclusion: unlikely. Those responsible would pay with their lives for
such an outrage against the Rais.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saddam had said it, but he was lying.
Conclusion: quite feasible—to boost morale among his flagging and apprehensive
supporters. But why confine the news to the innermost fanatics, who were not
flagging and who were not apprehensive? Morale-boosting propaganda is for the
masses and abroad. Unanswerable.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saddam did not say it. Conclusion: the whole
report was a farrago of lies. Secondary conclusion: Jericho lied because he is
greedy for money and thinks with the war coming his time will soon be over. He
had put a million-dollar price tag on his information.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Jericho lied because he has been unmasked and
has revealed all. Conclusion: also possible, and this option posed horrendous
personal hazard to the man in Baghdad to maintain the link.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At this point the CIA moved firmly into the
driver’s seat. Langley, being the paymaster, had a perfect right to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll give you the bottom line, Steve,” said
Bill Stewart to Steve Laing on a secure line from the CIA to Century House on
the evening of January 14. “Saddam’s wrong or he’s lying; Jericho’s wrong or he’s
lying. Whatever, Uncle Sam is not going to pay a million greenbacks into an
account in Vienna for this kind of trash.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s no way the unconsidered option might
be right after all, Bill?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Which one’s that?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That Saddam said it and he’s right.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No way. It’s a three-card trick. We’re not
going to swallow it. Look, Jericho’s been great for nine weeks, even though we’re
now going to have to recheck what he gave us. Half has already been proved, and
it’s good stuff. But he’s blown it with this last report. We think that’s the
end of the line. We don’t know why, but that’s the wisdom from the top of the
mountain.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Creates problems for us, Bill.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know, pal, and that’s why I’m calling within
minutes of the end of the conference with the Director. Either Jericho has been
taken and has told the goon squad everything, or he’s up and running. But if he
gets to know we’re not sending him any million dollars, I guess he’ll turn
nasty. Either way, that’s bad news for your man in there. He’s a good man,
right?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The best. Hell of a nerve.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So get him out of there, Steve. Fast.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think that’s what we’ll have to do, Bill.
Thanks for the tip. Pity—it was a good op.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The best, while it lasted.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stewart hung up. Laing went upstairs to see Sir
Colin. The decision was made within an hour.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>By the hour of breakfast on the morning of January 15 in
Saudi Arabia, every aircrew member, American, British, French, Italian, Saudi,
and Kuwaiti, knew that they were going to war. The politicians and the
diplomats, they believed, had failed to prevent it. Through the day all air
units moved to prebattle alert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The nerve centers of the campaign were located
in three establishments in Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the outskirts of Riyadh military air base
was a collection of huge air-conditioned tents, known because of the green
light that suffused them through the canvas as the Barn. This was the first
filter for the tidal wave of air intelligence photographs that had been flowing
in for weeks and that would double and triple in the weeks to come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The product of the Barn—a synthesis of the most
important photographic information pouring in from so many reconnaissance
sorties—went a mile up the road to the headquarters of the Royal Saudi Air
Force, a great chunk of which had been made over to Central Air Force, or
CENTAF.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A giant building of gray mottled concrete and
glass built on piles a hundred fifty meters long, the headquarters has a
basement running its full length, and it was here, one level below ground, that
CENTAF was based.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Despite the size of the basement, there was
still not enough space, so the parking lot had been crammed with an array of
more green tents and prefab buildings, where further interpretation took place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the basement was the focal point of it all,
the Joint Imagery Production Center, a warren of interconnecting rooms in which
worked throughout the war two hundred and fifty analysts, American and British,
of all three armed forces, and of all ranks. This was the Black Hole.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The overall air commander, General Chuck
Horner, was technically in charge, but as he was often called to the Defense
Ministry a mile farther up the road, the more usual presence was that of his
deputy, General Buster Glosson.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The air war planners in the Black Hole
consulted on a daily and even hourly basis a document called the Basic Target
Graphic, a list and map of everything in Iraq that was targeted for a hit. From
this they derived the daily bible of every air commander, squadron intelligence
officer, planning ops officer, and aircrew in the Gulf Theater—the Air Tasking
Order.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Each day’s ATO was an immensely detailed
document, running to over a hundred pages of typescript. It took three days to
prepare.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>First came Apportionment—the decision on the
percentages of the target types in Iraq that could be struck in a single day
and the available aircraft suitable for such a strike.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Day two saw Allocation—the conversion of the
percentage of Iraqi targets into actual numbers and locations. Day three was
for Distribution—the “who gets what” decision. It was in the distribution
process that it might be decided, for example, that this one is for the British
Tornados, this for the American Strike Eagles, this one for the Navy Tomcats,
this for the Phantoms, and that one for the B-52 Stratofortresses.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only then would each squadron and wing be sent
its menu for the following day. After that, it was up to them to do it—find the
target, work out the route, link up with the air-refueling tankers, plan the
strike direction, calculate the secondary targets in case of a no-go, and work
out their way home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The squadron commander would choose his crews—many
squadrons had multiple targets designated in a single day—and pick his flight
leaders and their wingmen. The weapons officers, of which Don Walker was one,
would select the ordnance—“iron” or “dumb” bombs, which are unguided bombs,
laser-guided bombs, laser-guided rockets, and so forth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A mile down Old Airport Road was the third
building. The Saudi Defense Ministry is immense, five linked main buildings of
shimmering white cement, seven stories high, with fluted columns up to the
fourth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was on this fourth floor that General Norman
Schwarzkopf had been allocated a handsome suite that he hardly ever saw,
frequently bunking down on a cot in the subbasement where he could be near his
command post.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In all, the Ministry is four hundred meters
long and a hundred feet high, a lavishness that paid dividends in the Gulf War,
when Riyadh had to play host to so many unexpected foreigners.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Belowground are two more floors of rooms
running the length of the building, and of the four hundred meters, Coalition
Command was allocated sixty. It was here that the generals sat in conclave
throughout the war, watching on a giant map as staff officers pointed out what
had been done, what had been missed, what had shown up, what had moved, and
what the Iraqi response and dispositions had been.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shielded from the hot sun that January day, a
British squadron leader stood before the wall map showing the seven hundred
targets listed in Iraq, 240 primaries and the rest secondary, and remarked:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, that’s about it,”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Alas, that was not it. Unbeknownst to the
planners, for all the satellites and all the technology, sheer human ingenuity
in the form of camouflage and <i>maskirovka</i> had deceived them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In hundreds of emplacements across Iraq and
Kuwait, Iraqi tanks sat and brooded under their netting, well-targeted by the
Allies due to their metal content, picked up by overhead radars. They were in
many cases made of matchboard, plywood, and tinplate, the drums of scrap iron
inside giving the appropriate metallic response to the sensors. Scores of old
truck chassis now mounted replica launching tubes for Scud missiles. These
mobile “launchers” would all be solemnly blown apart by the Allies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But more seriously, seventy primary targets
concerned with weapons of mass destruction had not been spotted because they
were buried deep or cunningly disguised as something else. Only later would
planners puzzle over how the Iraqis had managed to reconstitute entire
destroyed divisions with such unbelievable speed; only later would United
Nations inspectors discover plant after plant and store after store that had
escaped, and come away knowing there were yet more buried underground.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But that hot day in 1990 no one knew these
things. What the young men out on the flight lines from Tabuq in the west to
Bahrain in the east and down to the ultrasecret Khamis Mushait in the south
knew was that in forty hours they would go to war and some of them would not
come back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the last full day before final briefings
began, most of them wrote home. Some chewed on their pencils and wondered what
to say. Others thought of their wives and children and cried as they wrote;
hands accustomed to controlling many tons of deadly metal sought to craft
inadequate words into saying what they felt; lovers tried to express what they
should have whispered before, fathers urged their sons to look after their
mothers if the worst should happen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Captain Don Walker heard the news with all the
other pilots and aircrew of the Rocketeers of the 336th TFS in a terse
announcement from the wing commander at Al Kharz. It was just before nine in
the morning, and the sun was already beating down on the desert like a
sledgehammer on a waiting anvil.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was none of the usual banter as the men
filed out of the tented briefing hall, each plunged in his private thoughts.
For each, these thoughts were much the same: the last attempt to avoid a war
had been tried and had failed; the politicians and the diplomats had shuttled
from conference to conference, postured and declaimed, urged, bullied, pleaded,
threatened, and cajoled in order to avoid a war—and had failed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So at least they believed, those young men who
had just learned that the talking was over at last, failing to understand that
they had for months past been destined for this day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker watched Squadron Commander Steve Turner
stump away to his tent to write what he genuinely believed might be his last
letter to Betty Jane back in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Randy Roberts had a
brief, muttered few words with Boomer Henry, then they parted and walked away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young Oklahoman looked at the pale blue
vault of sky where he had lusted to be since he was a small boy in Tulsa and
where he soon might die in this thirtieth year, and turned his steps toward the
perimeter. Like the others, he wanted to be alone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was no fence to the base at Al Kharz,
just the ochre sea of sand, shale, and gravel stretching away to the horizon
and beyond that to the next and the next. Walker passed the clamshell hangars
grouped around the concrete apron, where the mechanics were by then working on
their charges and the crew chiefs were passing among each team, conferring and
checking to ensure that when each of their babies finally went to war, they
would be machines as perfect as the hand of man could make them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker spotted his own Eagle among them and was
awed as always when he contemplated the F-15E from afar by its air of quiet
menace. It crouched silently amid the teeming swarm of men and women in
coveralls who crawled all over its burly frame, immune to love or lust, hate or
fear, patiently waiting for the moment when it would finally do what it had
been designed to do all those years ago on the drawing board—bring flame and death
to the people designated as its target by the President of the United States.
Walker envied his Eagle; for all its myriad complexity, it could not feel
anything, it could never be afraid.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He left the city of canvas behind him and
walked across the plain of shale, his eyes shaded by the peak of his baseball
cap and the aviator glasses, hardly feeling the heat of the sun on his
shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For eight years he had flown the aircraft of
his country and done so because he loved it. But never once had he really,
truly contemplated the prospect that he might die in battle. Part of every
combat pilot muses with the notion of testing his skill, his nerve, and the
excellence of his airplane against another man in a real rather than a dummy
contest. But another part always assumes that it will never happen. It will
never really come to killing other mothers’ sons, or being killed by them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That morning, like all the others, he realized
at last that it truly had come to this: that all those years of study and training
had finally led to this day and this place; that in forty hours he would take
his Eagle into the sky again, and that this time he might not come back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Like the others, he thought of home. Being an
only child and a single man, he thought of his mother and father. He remembered
all the times and places of his boyhood in Tulsa, the things he and his parents
had done together in the yard behind the house, the day he had been given his
first catcher’s mitt and forced his father to pitch to him until the sun went
down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His thoughts strayed back to the vacations they
had shared before he left home to go to college and then to the Air Force. The
one he recalled best was the time his father took him on a men-only fishing
trip to Alaska the summer he was twelve.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ray Walker had been almost twenty years younger
then, leaner and fitter, stronger than his son, before the years reversed the
difference. They had taken a kayak, with a guide and other vacationers, and
skimmed the icy waters of Glacier Bay, watched the black bears gathering
berries on the mountain slopes, the harbor seals basking on the last remaining
floes of August, and the sun rising over the Mendenhall Glacier behind Juneau.
Together they had hauled two seventy-pound monsters out of Halibut Hole and
taken the deep-running king salmon out of the channel off Sitka.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now he found himself walking across a sea of
baking sand in a land far from home with tears running down his face, unwiped,
drying in the sun. If he died, he would never marry or have children of his
own. Twice he had almost proposed; once to a girl in college, but that was when
he was very young and infatuated, the second time to a more mature woman he had
met off-base near McConnell, who let him know she could never be the wife of a
jet jockey.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now he wanted, as he had never wanted before,
to have children of his own; he wanted a woman to come home to at the end of
the day, and a daughter to tuck up in her crib with a bedtime story, and a son
to teach how to catch a spinning football, to bat and pitch, to hike and fish,
the way his father had taught him. More than that, he wanted to go back to
Tulsa and embrace his mother again, who had worried so much over the things he
had done and had bravely pretended not to. ...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young pilot finally returned to the base,
sat down at a rickety table in his shared tent, and sought to write a letter
home. He was not a good letter writer. Words did not come easily. He usually
tended to describe the things that had happened recently in the squadron, his
friends, the state of the weather. This was different.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He wrote two pages to his parents, like so many
sons that day. He sought to explain what was going on in his head, which was
not easy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He told them about the news that had been
announced that morning and what it meant, and he asked them not to worry about
him. He had had the best training in the world and flew the best fighter in the
world for the best air force in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He wrote that he was sorry for all the times he
had been a pain, and he thanked them for all they had done for him over the
years, from the first day they had had to wipe his bottom to the time they had
come to be present when the general pinned those coveted flier’s wings on his
chest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In forty hours, he explained., he would take
his Eagle off the runway again, but this time it would be different. This time,
for the first time, he would seek to kill other human beings, and they would
seek to kill him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He would not see their faces or sense their
fear, as they would not know his, for that is not the way of modern war. But if
they succeeded and he failed, he wanted his parents to know how much he had
loved them, and he hoped he had been a good son.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he had finished, he sealed his letter.
Many other letters were sealed mat day across the length and breadth of Saudi
Arabia. Then the military postal services took them, and they were delivered to
Trenton and Tulsa and London and Rouen and Rome.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That night Mike Martin received a burst from his
controllers in Riyadh. When he played the tape back, it was Simon Paxman speaking.
It was not a long message, but it was clear and to the point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In his previous message, Jericho had been
wrong, completely and utterly wrong. Every scientific check proved there was no
way he could be right.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had been wrong either deliberately or
inadvertently. In the first case he must have turned, lured by the lust for
money, or been turned. In the second he would be aggrieved because the CIA
absolutely refused to pay him a further dollar for this sort of product.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That being so, there was no choice but to
believe either that, with Jericho’s cooperation, the whole operation had been
blown to Iraqi Counterintelligence, now in the hands of “your friend Hassan
Rahmani”; or that it soon would be, if Jericho sought revenge by sending
Rahmani an anonymous tip.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All six dead-letter boxes must now be assumed
to be compromised. Under no circumstances were they to be approached. Martin
should make his own preparations to escape Iraq at the first safe opportunity,
perhaps under the mantle of the chaos that would ensue in twenty-four hours.
End of message.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin thought it through for the remainder of
the night. He was not surprised that the West disbelieved Jericho. That the
mercenary’s payments were now to cease was a blow. The man had only reported
the contents of a conference at which Saddam had spoken. So Saddam had lied—nothing
new in that. What else was Jericho to do—ignore it? It was the cheek of the man
in asking for a million dollars that had done it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beyond that, Paxman’s logic was impeccable.
Within four days, maybe five, Jericho would have checked and found no more
money. He would become angry, resentful. If he were not himself blown away and
in the hands of Omar Khatib the Tormentor, he might well respond by making an
anonymous tipoff.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Yet it would be foolish for Jericho to do that.
If Martin were caught and broken—and he was uncertain how much pain he could
take at the hands of Khatib and his professionals in the Gymnasium—his own
information could point the finger at Jericho, whoever he was.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Still, people do foolish things. Paxman was
right, the drops might be under surveillance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As for escaping Baghdad, that was easier said
than done. From gossip in the markets, Martin had heard that the roads out of
town were thick with patrols of the AMAM and the Military Police, looking for
deserters and draft-dodgers. His own letter from the Soviet diplomat Kulikov
authorized him only to serve the man as gardener in Baghdad. Hard to explain to
a patrol checkpoint what he was doing heading west into the desert, where his
motorcycle was buried.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On balance he decided to stay inside the Soviet
compound for a while. It was probably the safest place in Baghdad.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942766">Chapter 15</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The deadline for Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait expired at
midnight on January 15. In a thousand rooms, huts, tents, and cabins across
Saudi Arabia, and in the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, men glanced at their
watches and then at each other. There was very little to say.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two floors beneath the Saudi Defense Ministry,
behind the steel doors that would have protected any bank vault in the world,
there was almost a sense of anticlimax. After all that work, all that planning,
there was nothing more to do—for a couple of hours. Now it was down to the
younger men. They had their tasks, and they would carry them out in the pitch
blackness far above the generals’ heads.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At 2:15 <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>,
General Schwarzkopf entered the war room. Everyone stood. He read aloud a
message to the troops, the chaplain said a prayer, and the commander-in-chief
said, “Okay, let’s get to work.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Far out across the desert, men were already at
work. First across the border were not the warplanes but a flight of eight
Apache helicopters belonging to the Army’s 101st Airborne Division. Their task
was limited but crucial.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>North of the border but short of Baghdad were
two powerful Iraqi radar bases, whose dishes commanded all the skies from the
Gulf in the east to the western desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The helicopters had been chosen, despite their
slow speed compared with supersonic jet fighters, for two reasons. Skimming the
desert, they could pass under the radar and approach the bases unseen; further,
the commanders wanted human-eyeball confirmation that the bases were really
wrecked, and from close range. Only the choppers could give that. It would cost
a lot of lives if those radars were left functioning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Apaches did all that was asked. They had
still not been noticed when they opened fire. All their crew had night-vision
helmets, which look as if they have short binoculars sticking out the front.
They give the pilot complete night vision, so that in utter darkness to the
naked eye he can see everything as if it were illuminated by a brilliant moon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>First they shattered the electrical generators
that powered the radars, then the communications facilities from which their
presence could be reported to missile sites farther inland; finally, they blew
away the radar dishes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In less than two minutes they had loosed
twenty-seven Hellfire laser-guided missiles, a hundred 70-mm. rockets, and four
thousand rounds of heavy-duty cannon fire. Both radar sites were left
smoldering ruins.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The mission opened a huge hole in the air
defense system of Iraq, and through this hole poured the remainder of the night’s
attack.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Those who saw General Chuck Horner’s air-war
plan later suggested it was probably one of the most brilliant ever devised. It
contained a surgical, step-by-step precision and enough flexibility to cope
with any contingency that required a variation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stage one was quite clear in its objectives and
led on to the other three stages. It was to destroy all Iraq’s air defense
systems and convert the Allies’ air superiority, with which they started, into
air supremacy. For the other three stages to succeed within the self-imposed
thirty-five-day time limit, Allied aircraft had to have the absolute run of
Iraqi air space without hindrance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In suppressing the air defense of Iraq, the key
was radar. In modern warfare, radar is the single most important and most used
tool, despite the brilliance of all the others in the armory.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Radar detects incoming warplanes; radar guides
your own fighters to intercept; radar guides the antiaircraft missiles; and
radar aims the guns.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Destroying the radar makes the enemy blind,
like a heavyweight boxer in the ring with no eyes. He may be big and powerful
still, he may pack a fearsome punch, but his enemy can move around the
sightless Samson, jabbing and slashing at the helpless giant until the foregone
conclusion is reached.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With the great hole punched in the forward
radar cover of Iraq, the Tornados and Eagles, the F-111 Aardvarks and F-4G Wild
Weasels powered through the gap, going for the radar sites farther inland,
heading for the missile bases guided by those radars, aiming for the command
centers where the Iraqi generals sat, and blowing away the communications posts
through which the generals were trying to talk to their outlying units.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the battleships <i>Wisconsin </i>and <i>Missouri</i>
and the cruiser <i>San Jacinto</i> out in the Gulf, fifty-two Tomahawk cruise
missiles were launched that night. Guiding themselves by a combination of
computerized memory bank and television nose camera, Tomahawks hug the contours
of the landscape, swerving on preordained courses to where they have to go.
When in the area, they “see” the target, compare it with the one in their
memory, identify the exact building, and home in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Wild Weasel is a version of the Phantom,
but specializing in radar-destruction. It carries HARMs, High-speed
Anti-Radiation Missiles. When a radar dish lights up or “illuminates,” it emits
electromagnetic waves, including infrared. It can’t help it. The HARM’s job is
to find those waves with its sensors and go straight to the heart of the radar
before exploding.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Perhaps strangest of all the warplanes slipping
northward through the sky that night was the F-117A, known as the Stealth
fighter. All black, created in such a shape that its multiple angles reflect
most of the radar waves directed at it and absorb the rest into its own body,
the Stealth fighter refuses to bounce hostile radar waves back to the receiver
and thereby betray its existence to the enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Thus invisible, the American F-117As that night
simply slid unnoticed through Iraqi radar screens to drop their
two-thousand-pound laser-guided bombs precisely onto thirty-four targets
associated with the national air defense system. Thirteen of those targets were
in and around Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the bombs landed, the Iraqis fired blindly
upward but could see nothing and missed. In Arabic, the Stealths were called <i>shabah</i>;
it means “ghost.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They came from the secret base of Khamis
Mushait deep in the south of Saudi Arabia, where they had been transferred from
their equally secret home at Tonopah, Nevada. While less fortunate American
airmen had to live in tents, Khamis Mushait had been built miles from anywhere
but with hardened aircraft shelters and air-conditioned accommodation, which
was why the prized Stealths had been put there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because they flew so far, theirs were among the
longest missions of the war, up to six hours from takeoff to landing, and all
under strain. They threaded their way undetected through some of the most
intense air defense systems in the world—those of Baghdad—and not one was ever
touched, on that or any other night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they had done what they came to do, they
slipped away again, cruising like stingrays in a calm sea, and went back to
Khamis Mushait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The most dangerous job of the night went to the
British Tornados. Their task then, and for the next week until it was
discontinued, was “airfield denial,” using their big, heavy JP-233
runway-busting bombs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Their problem was twofold. The Iraqis had built
their military airfields to be absolutely vast. Tallil was four times the size
of Heathrow, with sixteen runways and taxi tracks that could be used for
takeoff and landing as well. It was simply impossible to destroy it all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second problem was one of height and speed.
The JP-233s had to be launched from a Tornado in stabilized straight and level
flight. Even after bomb launch, the Tornados had no choice but to overfly the
target. Even if the radars were knocked out, the gunners weren’t; antiaircraft
artillery, known as triple-A, came up at them in rolling waves as they
approached, so that one pilot described those missions as “flying through tubes
of molten steel.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Americans had abandoned tests on the JP-233
bomb, judging it to be a pilot-killer. They were right. But the RAF crews
pressed on, losing planes and crews until they were called off and given other
duties.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bomb-droppers were not the only planes
aloft that night. Behind them and with them flew an extraordinary array of
backup services.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Air superiority fighters flew cover on and over
the strike bombers. The Iraqi ground controllers’ instructions to their own
pilots—the few who managed to take off that night—were jammed by the American
Air Force Ravens and the Navy equivalent Prowlers. Iraqi pilots aloft got no
verbal instructions and no radar guidance. Most, wisely, went straight back
home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Circling south of the border were sixty
tankers: American KC-135s and KC-10s, U.S. Navy KA-6Ds, and British Victors and
VC-10s. Their job was to receive the warplanes coming up from Saudi Arabia,
refuel them for the mission, then meet them on the way back to give them more
fuel to get home. This may sound routine, but actually doing it in pitch
darkness was described by one flier as “trying to shove spaghetti up a wildcat’s
backside.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And out over the Gulf, where they had been for
five months, the U.S. Navy’s E-2 Hawkeyes and the USAF’s E-3 Sentry AWACS
circled around and around, their radars picking up every friendly and every
enemy aircraft in the sky, warning, advising, guiding, and watching.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By dawn, Iraq’s radars had mostly been crushed,
her missile bases blinded, and her main command centers ruined. It would take
four more days and nights to complete the job, but air supremacy was already in
sight. Later would come the power-generating stations, telecommunications
towers, telephone exchanges, relay stations, aircraft shelters, control towers,
and all those known facilities for the production and storage of weapons of
mass destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later still would come the systematic “degradation”
to less than fifty percent of its fighting power of the Iraqi Army south and
southwest of the Kuwaiti border, a condition on which General Schwarzkopf
insisted before he would attack with ground troops.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two then-unknown factors would later cause
changes to the course of the war. One was Iraq’s decision to launch a barrage
of Scud missiles at Israel; the other would be triggered by an act of sheer
frustration on the part of Captain Don Walker of the 336th Tactical Fighter
Squadron.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Dawn broke on the morning of January 17 over a Baghdad
that was very badly shaken.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The ordinary citizens had not slept a wink from
three <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> on, and when daylight came,
some of them ventured out to peer curiously at the rubble of a score of major
sites across their city. That they had survived the night seemed to many
miraculous, for they were simple folk who did not realize that the twenty
smoking mounds of rubble had been carefully selected and hit with such
precision that the citizenry had been in no mortal danger.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the real sense of shock was among the
hierarchs. Saddam Hussein had left the Presidential Palace and was lodged in
his extraordinary multistory bunker behind and beneath the Rashid Hotel, which
was still full of Westerners, mainly from the media.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bunker had been built years earlier inside
a vast crater dug by earth-movers, with mainly Swedish technology. So
sophisticated were its security measures that it was in fact a box within a
box, and beneath and around the inner box were springs of such strength as to
protect the inhabitants from a nuclear bomb, reducing shock waves that would
flatten the city above into a minor tremor down below.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Although access was via a hydraulically
operated ramp set in waste ground behind the hotel, the main structure was
beneath the Rashid, which had deliberately been built on the ground above as a
specific repose for Westerners in Baghdad. Any enemy wishing to attempt a
deep-penetration bombing of the bunker would have to obliterate the Rashid
first.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Try as they might, the sycophants surrounding
the Rais were hard put to create a gloss over the night’s disasters. Slowly,
the level of the catastrophe penetrated all their minds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had all counted on a blanket bombing of
the city, which would have left residential areas flattened and thousands of
innocent civilians dead. This carnage would then be shown to the media, who
would film it all and show it to the sickened audiences back home. Thus would
begin the global wave of revulsion against President Bush and the United
States, culminating in an emergency session of the UN Security Council and the
veto of China and Russia against further massacre.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By midday, it was plain that the Sons of Dogs
from across the Atlantic were not obliging. So far as the Iraqi generals were
aware, the bombs fell approximately where they had been aimed, but that was
all. With every major military installation in Baghdad deliberately sited in
densely populated housing areas, it should have been impossible for massive
civilian casualties to be avoided. Yet while a tour of the city revealed twenty
command posts, missile sites, radar bases, and communication centers blasted to
rubble, those not in the targeted buildings had sustained little more than
broken windows and were even now gaping at the mess.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The authorities had to be satisfied with
inventing a civilian death toll and claims that American aircraft had been shot
out of the skies like autumn leaves. Most Iraqis, stultified by years of
propaganda, believed these first reports—for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The generals in charge of air defense knew
better. By midday, it was clear to them that they had lost almost all their
radar warning ability, that their SAMs—surface-to-air missiles—were blind, and
that communication with the outlying units was all but cut. Worse, the radar
operators who had survived kept insisting the damage had been done by bombers
that simply had not shown up on their screens. The liars were at once put under
arrest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Some civilian casualties had indeed occurred.
At least two Tomahawk cruise missiles, their fins damaged by conventional triple-A
gunfire rather than SAMs, had crashed off-target. One had demolished two houses
and blown tiles off a mosque, an outrage that the press corps was shown during
the afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other had fallen on waste ground and made a
large crater. During the late afternoon the body of a woman was found at the
bottom of it, badly smashed by the impact that apparently killed her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bombing raids continued throughout the day, so
that the ambulance crews were not prepared to do more than wrap the corpse
hastily in a blanket, bring it to the morgue of the nearest hospital, and leave
it there. The hospital happened to be close to a major Air Force command center
that had been demolished, and all beds were occupied by service personnel
wounded in the attack. Several scores of bodies were taken to the same morgue,
all dead from bomb blasts. The woman’s was just one of them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With his resources at the breaking point, the
pathologist worked fast and cursorily. Identification and cause of death were
his principal priorities, and he had no time for leisured examination. Across
the city the crump of more bombs could be heard, and the blast of counterfire
was unceasing. He had no doubt the evening and night would bring him more
bodies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What surprised the doctor was that all his dead
bodies were service personnel, except the woman. She seemed to be about thirty
and had once been comely. The concrete dust clinging to the blood of her
smashed face, coupled with the place she had been found, gave cause for no
other explanation than that she had been running away when the missile struck
the waste ground and killed her. The body was so tagged, then wrapped for
burial.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her handbag had been found next to the body,
and it contained a powder compact, lipstick, and her identity cards. Having
established that one Leila Al-Hilla was undoubtedly a civilian victim of a bomb
blast, the harassed pathologist had her taken away for hasty burial.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The more elaborate post-mortem for which he did
not have time that January 17 would have shown the woman had been repeatedly
and savagely raped before being systematically beaten to death. The dumping in
the crater had come several hours later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Abdullah Kadiri had moved from his
sumptuous office in the Defense Ministry two days earlier. There was no point
in staying to be blown to bits by an American bomb, and he was sure the
Ministry would be hit and destroyed before the air war was many days old. He
was right.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had established himself in his villa, which
he was reasonably certain was anonymous enough—albeit luxurious—not to be on
any American target map. In this too he was right.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The villa had long since been provided with its
own communications room, which staff from the Ministry were now manning. All
his communications to the various command headquarters of the Armored Corps
around Baghdad were by buried fiber-optic cable, which was also out of reach of
the bombers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only the farther units had to be contacted by
radio, with a threat of intercept—plus, of course, those in Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His problem, as darkness fell over Baghdad that
night, was not how to contact his Armored Corps commanders or what orders to
give them. They could take no part in the air war, being tasked to disperse
their tanks as widely as possible among the rows of dummies or bury them in the
subterranean bunkers and wait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His problem, rather, was his personal security,
and it was not the Americans he feared.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two nights earlier, rising from his bed with a
bursting bladder, bleary with arak as usual, he had stumbled to the bathroom.
Finding the door, as he thought, stuck, he had pushed hard. His two hundred
pounds of body weight had torn the inner bolt from its screws, and the door
flew open.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bleary he might have been, but Abdullah Kadiri
had not come from a back street near Tikrit to command all Iraq’s tanks outside
the Republican Guard, had not climbed the slippery ladder of Ba’ath Party
internal feuding, and had not sustained a trusted place on the Revolutionary
Command Council without ample reserves of animal cunning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had stared in silence at his mistress,
sitting wrapped in a robe on the toilet seat, her paper sustained by the back
of a Kleenex box, her mouth in a round O of horror and surprise, her pen still
poised in midair. Then he had hauled her to her feet and hit her on the point
of the jaw.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When she came to, with a jug of water dashed in
the face, he had had time to read the report she was preparing and to summon
the trusty Kemal from his quarters across the yard. It was Kemal who had taken
the whore down to the basement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kadiri had read and reread the report she had
almost finished. Had it concerned his personal habits and preferences, a lever
for future blackmail, he would have dismissed it and simply had her killed. In
any case, no blackmail would ever have worked. The personal baseness of some of
the entourage of the Rais was greater than his own, he knew. He also knew that
the Rais did not care.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This was worse. Apparently he had talked of
things that had happened within the government and the Army. That she was
spying was obvious. He needed to know for how long and what she had reported
already, but most of all, for whom.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kemal took his long-awaited pleasures first,
with his master’s permission. No man would lust after what remained when Kemal
had finished the interrogation. It had taken several hours. Then, Kadiri knew,
Kemal had gotten it all—at least, all the courtesan knew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After that, Kemal had continued for his own
amusement until she was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Kadiri was convinced that she had not known the
real identity of the man who had recruited and ran her to spy on him, but the
picture had to fit Hassan Rahmani.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The description of the
information-against-money exchanges in the confessional of St. Joseph’s showed
the man was professional, and Rahmani was certainly that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That he should be watched did not worry Kadiri.
All those around the Rais were watched; indeed, they watched each other. The
rules of the Rais were simple and clear. Every figure of high rank was watched
and reported on by three of his peers. A denunciation for treachery could and
probably would lead to ruin. Thus, few conspiracies could get very far. One of those
confided in would report the matter, and it would come to the ears of the Rais.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To complicate matters, each member of the
entourage was occasionally provoked, to see what his reaction would be. A
colleague, briefed to do so, would take his friend aside and propose treason.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the friend agreed, he was finished. If he
failed to report the proposer, he was finished. So any approach could be a
provocation—it was simply too unsafe to assume otherwise. Thus, each reported
on the others.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But this was different. Rahmani was head of Counterintelligence.
Had he taken the initiative on his own, and if so, why? Was it an operation
with the knowledge and approval of the Rais himself, and if so, why?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What had he said? the general wondered. Things
indiscreet, no doubt. But traitorous?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The body had stayed in the basement until the
bombs fell, then Kemal had found a crater on a patch of waste ground to dump
it. The general had insisted the handbag be placed nearby. Let that bastard
Rahmani know what had happened to his slut.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As midnight passed, General Abdullah Kadiri
sweated alone, tipping a few drops of water into his tenth tumbler of arak. If
it was Rahmani alone, he would finish the bastard. But how could he know how
far up the ladder he was distrusted? He would have to be careful henceforth,
more careful than he had ever been before. Those late-night trips into the city
would end. In any case, with the air war started, it was time to cease.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Simon Paxman had flown back again to London. There was no
point in staying in Riyadh. Jericho had been kicked firmly into touch by the
CIA, although the unseen renegade in Baghdad would not know it yet, and Mike
Martin was confined to quarters until he could escape to the desert and find
his way to safety across the border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later, Paxman could swear with his hand on his
heart the meeting on the evening of the eighteenth with Dr. Terry Martin had
been a true coincidence. He knew Martin lived in Bayswater, as he did himself,
but it is a large borough with many shops.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With his wife away at the bedside of her sick
mother and his own return unforeseen, Paxman had come home to an empty flat and
an empty fridge, so he went shopping at an open-late supermarket on Westbourne
Grove.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Terry Martin’s cart nearly crashed into his own
as he came around the corner of pastas and pet food. Both men were startled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Am I allowed to know you?” asked Martin with
an embarrassed grin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was no one else in that aisle at the
time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why not?” said Paxman. “I’m just a humble
civil servant shopping for his evening meal.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They finished their purchases together and
agreed to adjourn to an Indian restaurant for a meal rather than cook at home
alone. Hilary, it seemed, was also away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman should, of course, not have done it. He
should never have felt uncomfortable that Terry Martin’s elder brother was in a
situation of appalling danger and that he, with others, had sent him into it.
It should not have worried him that the trusting scholar should really believe
that his adored sibling was safe inside Saudi Arabia. All tradecraft insists
that one does not worry about that sort of thing. But he did.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was another worry. Steve Laing was his
superior at Century House, but Laing had never been to Iraq. His background was
in Egypt and Jordan. Paxman knew Iraq—and Arabic. Not like Terry Martin, of
course, but Martin was exceptional. Paxman knew enough, from several visits
before he had been made head of the Iraq Desk, to form a sincere respect for
the quality of Iraqi scientists and the ingenuity of their engineers. It was no
secret that most British technical institutes considered their graduates from
Iraq the best in the Arab world.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The worry that had nagged at him since he was
told by his superiors that the last Jericho report could be none other than a
load of nonsense was simply the fear that, despite all the odds, Iraq might
actually be further ahead than the Western scientists were prepared to credit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He waited until the two meals had arrived,
surrounded by small pots of the accessories without which no Indian meal is
complete, then made up his mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Terry,” he said, “I am going to do something
which, if it ever got out, would mean the end of my career in the Service.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin was startled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That sounds drastic. Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because I have been officially warned off you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The scholar was about to spoon some mango
chutney onto his plate, then stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I am not thought to be reliable anymore? It
was Steve Laing who pulled me into all this.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s not that. The view is that—you worry too
much.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman was not prepared to use Laing’s word <i>fusspot</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Perhaps I do. It’s the training. Academics do
not like puzzles that seem to have no answer. We have to go on worrying at it
until the jumbled hieroglyphic makes sense. Was it that business of the phrase
in the intercept?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, that and other things.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman had chosen chicken khorma; Martin liked
his hotter—vindaloo. Because he knew his eastern food, Martin drank hot black
tea, not ice-cold beer, which only makes things worse. He blinked at Paxman
over the edge of his mug.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right. So what is the great confession?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Will you give me your word that this goes no
further?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s been another intercept.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman had not the slightest intention of
revealing the existence of Jericho. The group who knew of that asset in Iraq was
still tiny and would stay that way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can I listen to it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. It’s been suppressed. Don’t approach Sean
Plummer. He’d have to deny it, and that would reveal where you got the
information.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin helped himself to more raita to cool
down the flaming curry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What does it say, this new intercept?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman told him. Martin put down his fork and
wiped his face, which was bright pink beneath the ginger thatch of his hair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can it—could it, under any circumstances, be
true?” asked Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t know. I’m not a physicist. The brass
has given it a no-no?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Absolutely. The nuclear scientists all agree
it simply cannot be true. So Saddam was lying.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Privately, Martin thought it was a very odd
radio intercept. It sounded more like information from inside a closed meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Saddam lies,” Martin said, “all the time. But
usually for public consumption. This was to his own inner core of confidants? I
wonder why? Morale booster on the threshold of war?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s what the powers think,” said Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Have the generals been told?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. The reasoning is, they are extremely busy
right now and do not need to be bothered by something that simply has to be
rubbish.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So what do you want from me, Simon?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Saddam’s mind. No one can figure it out.
Nothing he does makes sense in the West. Is he certifiably insane or crazy like
a fox?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In his world, the latter. In his world, what
he does makes sense. The terror that revolts us has no moral downside for him,
and it makes sense. The threats and the bluster make sense to him. Only when he
tries to enter our world—with those ghastly PR exercises in Baghdad, ruffling
that little English boy’s hair, playing the benign uncle, that sort of thing—only
when he tries that does he look a complete fool. In his own world he is not a
fool. He survives, he stays in power, he keeps Iraq united, his enemies fail
and perish.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Terry, as we sit here, his country is being
pulverized.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It doesn’t matter, Simon. It’s all
replaceable.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But why did he say what he is supposed to have
said?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do the powers think?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That he lied.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No,” said Martin, “he lies for public
consumption. To his inner core, he doesn’t have to. They are his, anyway.
Either the source of the information lied and Saddam never said that; or he
said it because he believed it was true.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then he was himself lied to?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Possibly. Whoever did that will pay dearly
when he finds out. But then, the intercept could be phony. A deliberate bluff,
designed to be intercepted.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman could not say what he knew: that it was
not an intercept. It came from Jericho. And in two years under the Israelis and
three months under the Anglo-Americans, Jericho had never been wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’ve got doubts, haven’t you?” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I suppose I have,” admitted Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Straws in the wind, Simon. A phrase in an
intercept, a man told to shut up and called a son of a whore, a phrase from
Saddam about succeeding and being seen to succeed—in the hurting of America—and
now this. We need a piece of string.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“String?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Straw only makes up a bale when you can wrap
it around with string. There has to be something else as to what he really has
in mind. Otherwise, the powers are right, and he will go for the gas weapon he
already has.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right. I’ll look for a piece of string.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And I,” said Martin, “did not meet you this
evening, and we have not spoken.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you,” said Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Hassan Rahmani heard of the death of his agent Leila two
days after it happened, on January 19. She had not appeared for a scheduled
handover of information from General Kadiri’s bed, and fearing the worst, he
had checked morgue records.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The hospital in Mansour had produced the
evidence, though the corpse had been buried, with many others from the
destroyed military buildings, in a mass grave.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hassan Rahmani no more believed that his agent
had been hit by a stray bomb while crossing a piece of waste ground in the
middle of the night than he believed in ghosts. The only ghosts in the skies
above Baghdad were the invisible American bombers of which he had read in
Western defense magazines, and they were not ghosts but logically contrived
inventions. So was the death of Leila Al-Hilla.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His only logical conclusion was that Kadiri had
discovered her extramural activities and put a stop to them. Which meant she
would have talked before she died.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That meant, for him, that Kadiri had become a
powerful and dangerous enemy. Worse, his principal conduit into the inner
councils of the regime had been closed down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Had he known that Kadiri was as worried as he
himself, Rahmani would have been delighted. But he did not know. He only knew
that from thenceforward he was going to have to be extremely careful.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On the second day of the air war, Iraq launched its first
battery of missiles against Israel. The media at once announced them as being
Soviet-built Scud-Bs, and the title stuck throughout the rest of the war. In
fact, they were not Scuds at all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The point of the onslaught was not foolish.
Iraq recognized quite clearly that Israel was not a country prepared to accept
large numbers of civilian casualties. As the first rocket warheads fell into
the suburbs of Tel Aviv, Israel reacted by going on the warpath. This was
exactly what Baghdad wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within the fifty-nation Coalition ranged
against Iraq were seventeen Arab states, and if there was one thing they all
shared apart from the Islamic faith, it was a hostility to Israel. Iraq
calculated, probably rightly, that if Israel could be provoked into joining the
war by a strike against her, the Arab nations in the Coalition would pull out.
Even King Fahd, monarch of Saudi Arabia and Keeper of the Two Holy Places,
would be in an impossible position.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first reactions to the fall of the rockets
on Israel was that they might be loaded with gas or germ cultures. Had they
been, Israel could not have been restrained. It was quickly proved that the
warheads were of conventional explosives. But the psychological effect inside
Israel was still enormous.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The United States immediately brought massive
pressure on Jerusalem not to respond with a counterstrike. The Allies, Itzhak
Shamir was told, would take care of it. Israel actually launched a
counterstrike in the form of a wave of her own F-15 fighter-bombers but called
them back while still in Israeli air space.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The real Scud was a clumsy, obsolete Soviet
missile of which Iraq had bought nine hundred several years earlier. It had a
range of under three hundred kilometers and carried a warhead of close to a
thousand pounds. It was not guided, and even in its original form it would, at
full range, land anywhere within half a mile of its target.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From Iraq’s point of view, it had been a
virtually useless purchase. It could not reach Teheran in the Iran-Iraq war,
and it certainly could not reach Israel, even if fired from the extreme western
border of Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What the Iraqis had done in the meantime, with
German technical help, was bizarre. They had cut up the Scuds into chunks and
used three of them to create two new rockets. To put not too fine a point on
it, the new Al-Husayn rocket was a mess.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By adding extra fuel tanks the Iraqis had
increased the range to 620 kilometers so that it could (and did) reach Teheran
and Israel. But its payload was cut to a pathetic 160 pounds. Its guidance,
always erratic, was now chaotic. Two of them, launched at Israel, not only
missed Tel Aviv, they missed the entire republic and fell in Jordan.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But as a terror weapon it almost worked. Even
though all the Al-Husayns that fell on Israel had less payload than one
American two-thousand-pound bomb falling on Iraq, they sent the Israeli
population into something approaching panic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The United States responded in three ways.
Fully a thousand sorties were flown to shoot down the incoming rockets and the
even more elusive mobile launchers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Batteries of American Patriot missiles were
sent into Israel within hours in an attempt to shoot down the incoming rockets
but mainly to persuade Israel to stay out of the war.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And the SAS, and later the American Green
Berets, were sent into the western deserts of Iraq to find the mobile rocket
launchers and either destroy them with their own Milan missiles or call in air
strikes by radio.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Patriots, although hailed as the saviors of
all creation, had limited success—but that was not their fault. Raytheon had
designed the Patriot to intercept airplanes, not rockets, and they had been
hastily adapted to a new role. The reason they hardly ever hit an incoming
warhead was never disclosed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fact was, in extending the Scud’s range by
turning it into the Al-Husayn, the Iraqis had also increased its altitude. The
new rocket, entering inner space on its parabolic flight, was getting red-hot
as it came back down, something the Scud was never designed to do. As it
reentered earth’s atmosphere, it just broke up. What descended on Israel was
not an entire rocket but a falling trash can.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Patriot, doing its job, went up to
intercept and found itself with not one piece of metal coming toward it but a
dozen. So its tiny brain told it to do what it was programmed to do—go for the
biggest one. This was usually the spent fuel tank, tumbling downward out of
control. The warhead, much smaller and detached in the breakup, just fell free.
Many failed to explode at all, and most of the battering sustained by Israeli
buildings was impact-damage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the so-called Scud was a psychological
terror, the Patriot was a psychological savior. But the psychology worked,
inasmuch as it was part of the solution to keeping Israel out of the war.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Another part was the promise of the
much-improved Arrow rocket when it was ready—installed by 1994. Section three
was the right of Israel to choose up to one hundred extra targets that the
Allied air forces would obliterate. The choices were made—mainly targets in
Western Iraq that affected Israel, roads, bridges, airfields, anything pointing
west at her. None of these targets by their geographical location had anything
to do with the liberation of Kuwait on the other side of the peninsula.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fighter-bombers of the American and British
air forces assigned to Scud-hunting claimed numerous successes, claims regarded
with immediate skepticism by the CIA, to the rage of General Chuck Horner and
General Schwarzkopf.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two years after the war, Washington officially
denied that a single mobile Scud-launcher had been destroyed by air power—a
suggestion still capable today of reducing any pilot involved to incandescent
rage. The fact was, the pilots had largely been deceived again by <i>maskirovka</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the southern desert of Iraq is a featureless
billiard table, the western and northwestern deserts are rocky, hilly, and riven
by a thousand wadis and gullies. This was the land over which Mike Martin had
driven on his infiltration to Baghdad. Before launching its rocket attacks,
Baghdad had created scores of dummy Scud mobile launchers, and these were
hidden, along with the real ones, across the landscape.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The habit was to produce them in the night, a
tube of sheet metal mounted on an old flatbed truck, and at dawn torch a drum
of oil and cotton waste inside the tube. Far away, the sensors in the AWACS
picked up the heat source and logged a missile launch. The fighters vectored
onto the location did the rest and claimed a kill.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The men who could not be fooled this way were
the SAS. Although only a handful in number, they swarmed into the western
deserts in their Land-Rovers and motorbikes, lay up in the blistering days and
freezing nights, and watched. At two hundred yards, they could see what was a
real mobile launcher and what was a dummy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As the real rocket launchers came out from the
culverts and beneath the bridges where they were hidden from aerial
observation, the silent men in the crags watched through binoculars. If there
were too many Iraqis around, they quietly called in air strikes by radio. If
they could get away with it, they used their own Milan antitank rockets, which
made a very nice bang when hitting the fuel tank of a real Al-Husayn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was soon realized there was an invisible
north-south line running down the desert. West of that line, the Iraqi rockets
could hit Israel; east of it, they were out of range. The job was to terrorize
the Iraqi crews into not daring to venture west of that line but to fire from
east of it and lie to their superiors. It took eight days, and then the rocket
attacks on Israel stopped. They never started again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later, the Baghdad-to-Jordan road was used as a
divider. North of it was Scud Alley North, terrain of the American Special
Forces, who went in by long-range helicopter. Below the road was Scud Alley
South, bailiwick of the British Special Air Service. Four good men died in
those deserts, but they did the job they had been sent in to do, where billions
of dollars of technology had been deceived.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On day four of the air war, January 20, the
336th Squadron out of Al Kharz was one of the units that had not been diverted
to the western deserts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Its assignment that day included a big SAM
missile site northwest of Baghdad. The SAMs were controlled by two large radar
dishes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The air attacks in General Horner’s plan were
now rolling northward. With just about every missile base and radar dish south
of a horizontal line through southern Baghdad wiped out, the time had come to
clear the air space east, west, and north of the capital.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With twenty-four Strike Eagles in the squadron,
January 20 was going to be a multimission day. The squadron commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Steve Turner, had allocated a twelve-plane detail for the
missile base. A swarm of Eagles that large was known as a “gorilla.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The gorilla was led by one of the two senior
flight commanders. Four of the twelve planes were packing HARMs, the
radar-busting missiles that home in on infrared signals from a radar dish. The
other eight carried two long, gleaming, stainless-steel-cased laser-guided
bombs known as GBU-10-I’s. When the radars were dead and the missiles blind,
they would follow the HARMs and blow away the rocket batteries.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It did not seem as if things were going to go
wrong. The twelve Eagles took off in three groups of four, established
themselves in a loose echelon formation, and climbed to an altitude of
twenty-five thousand feet. The sky was a brilliant blue, and the ochre desert
below clearly visible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The weather report over the target indicated a
stronger wind than over Saudi Arabia but made no mention of a <i>shamal</i>, one
of those rapid dust storms that can wipe out a target in seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>South of the border, the twelve Eagles met
their tankers, two KC-10s. Each tanker could suckle six hungry fighters, so one
by one the Eagles drifted onto station behind the tankers and waited as the
boom operator, gazing at them through his Perspex window only a few feet away, “swam”
his boom arm to lock onto their waiting fuel nozzles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, the twelve Eagles refueled for their
mission and turned north toward Iraq. An AWACS out over the Gulf told them
there was no hostile air activity ahead of them. Had there been Iraqi fighters
in the air, the Eagles carried, apart from their bombs, two kinds of air-to-air
rockets: the Air Interception Missile 7 and the AIM-9, better known as the
Sparrow and the Sidewinder.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The missile base was there, all right. But its
radars were not active. If the radar dishes were not operating on their
arrival, they should have illuminated immediately to guide the SAMs in their
search for the oncoming intruders. As soon as the radars went active, the four
Strike Eagles carrying the HARMs would simply take them out or, in USAF
parlance, ruin their whole day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Whether the Iraqi commander was afraid for his
skin or just extremely smart, the Americans never did work out. But those
radars refused to come alive. The first four Eagles, led by the flight
commander, dropped down and down to provoke the radars into switching on. They
refused.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It would have been foolish for the
bomb-carriers to go in with the radars still intact—had they suddenly
illuminated without warning, the SAMs would have had the Eagles cold.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After twenty minutes over the target, the
attack was called off. Components of the gorilla were assigned to their
secondary targets.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker had a quick word with Tim Nathanson,
his wizzo, sitting behind him. The secondary target for the day was a fixed
Scud site south of Samarra, which was in any case being visited by other
fighter-bombers because it was a known poison gas facility.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The AWACS confirmed there was no takeoff
activity out of the two big Iraqi air bases at Samarra East and Balad
Southeast. Don Walker called up his wingman, and the two-plane element headed
for the Scud site.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All communications between the American
aircraft were coded by the Have-quick system, which garbles the speech to
anyone trying to listen in who is not carrying the same system. The codings can
be changed daily but were common to all Allied aircraft.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker glanced around. The sky was clear; half
a mile away his wingman, Randy “R-2” Roberts, rode astern and slightly above
him, with wizzo Jim “Boomer” Henry sitting behind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Over the Scud fixed-launcher position, Walker
dropped down to identify the target properly. To his rage, it was obscured by
swirling clouds of desert dust, a <i>shamal</i> that had sprung up, created by
the strong desert wind down there on the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His laser-guided bombs would not miss, so long
as they could follow the beam projected at the target from his own aircraft. To
project the guiding beam, he had to see his target.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Furious and running short of fuel, he turned
away. Two frustrations in the same morning were too much. He hated to land with
a full rack of ordnance. But there was nothing for it, the road home lay south.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Three minutes later, he saw an enormous
industrial complex beneath him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What’s that?” he asked Tim. The WSO checked
his briefing maps.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s called Tarmiya.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Jesus, it’s big.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yeah.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Although neither man knew it, the Tarmiya
industrial complex contained 381 buildings and covered an area of ten miles by
ten miles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Listed?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nope.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Going down anyway. Randy, cover my ass.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Got it,” came over the air from his wingman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker dropped his Eagle clean down to ten
thousand feet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The industrial spread was huge. In the center
was one enormous building, the size of a covered sports stadium.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Going in.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don, it’s nontarget.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dropping to eight thousand feet, Walker
activated his laser-guidance system and lined up on the vast factory below and
in front of him. His head-up display ran off the distance as it shortened and
gave him a seconds-to-fire reading. As the latter hit zero, he released his
bombs, keeping his nose still on the approaching target.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The laser-sniffer in the nose of the two bombs
was the PAVEWAY system. Under his fuselage was the guidance module, called
LANTIRN. The LANTIRN threw an invisible infrared beam at the target, where the
beam rebounded to form a sort of funnel-shaped electronic basket pointing back
toward him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The PAVEWAY nose cones sensed this basket,
entered it, and followed the funnel down and inward until they impacted
precisely where the beam was aimed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Both bombs did their job. They blew up under
the lip of the roof of the factory. Seeing them explode, Don Walker hauled
back, lifted the nose of the Eagle, and powered it back to twenty-five thousand
feet. An hour later, he and his wingman, after another refuel in midair, were
back at Al Kharz.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before he lifted his nose, Walker had seen the
blinding flash of the two explosions and the great column of smoke that had
arisen, and he had caught a glimpse of the dust cloud that would follow the
bombing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What he did not see was that those two bombs
tore out one end of the factory, lifting a large section of roof up into the
air like the sail of a ship at sea.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nor did he observe that the strong desert wind
that morning—the same one that had created the dust storm to blot out the Scud
site—did the rest. It tore the roof off the factory, peeling it back like the
lid of a sardine can, as sheets of roofing steel flew lethally in all
directions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Back at base, Don Walker, like every other
pilot, was extensively debriefed. It was a tiresome process for weary pilots,
but it had to be done. In charge was the squadron intelligence officer, Major
Beth Kroger.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No one pretended the gorilla had been a
success, but every pilot had taken out his secondary target, except one. Their
hotshot weapons officer had flunked his secondary target and picked a tertiary
one at random.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What the hell did you do that for?” Kroger
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because it was huge and looked important.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It wasn’t even on the Tasking Order,” she
complained. She logged the target he had chosen, its exact location and
description, and his own bomb-damage report and filed it for the attention of
TACC—the Tactical Air Control Center, which shared the basement of CENTAF
beneath the Saudi Air Force headquarters with the Black Hole analysts in
Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If this turns out to be a water-bottling plant
or a baby-food factory, they’re gonna can your ass,” she warned Walker.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You know, Beth, you’re beautiful when you’re
angry,” he teased her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beth Kroger was a good career officer. If she
was going to be flirted with, she preferred colonels and up. As the three of
those on the base were seriously married, Al Kharz was turning out to be a
pain.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re out of line, <i>Captain</i>,” she told
him, and went off to file her report.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker sighed and went off to his cot to rest.
She was right, though. If he had just totaled the world’s biggest orphanage,
General Horner would personally have his captain’s bars for toothpicks. As it
happened, they never did tell Don Walker just what he had hit that morning. But
it was not an orphanage.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942767">Chapter 16</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Karim came to dine with Edith Hardenberg at her flat in
Grinzing that same night. He found his own way out to the suburbs by public
transportation, and he brought with him gifts: a pair of aromatically scented
candles, which he placed on the small table in the eating alcove and lit; and
two bottles of fine wine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Edith let him in, pink and embarrassed as ever,
then returned to fuss over the Wiener schnitzel she was preparing in her tiny
kitchen. It had been twenty years since she had prepared a meal for a man; she
was finding the ordeal daunting but, to her surprise, exciting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Karim had greeted her with a chaste peck on the
cheek in the doorway, which had made her even more flustered, then found Verdi’s
<i>Nabucco</i> in the library of her records and put it on the player.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Soon the aroma of the candles, musk and
patchouli, joined the gentle cadences of the “Slaves’ Chorus” to drift through
the apartment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was just as he had been told to expect it by
the neviot team that had broken in weeks before: very neat, very tidy,
extremely clean. The flat of a fussy woman who lived alone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the meal was ready, Edith presented it
with copious apologies. Karim tried the meat and pronounced it the best he had
ever tasted, which made her even more flustered, yet immensely pleased.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They talked as they ate, of things cultural; of
their projected visit to the Schönbrunn Palace and to see the fabulous Lipizzaner
horses at the Hofreitschule, the Spanish Riding School inside the Hofburg on
Josefsplatz.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Edith ate as she did everything else—precisely,
like a bird pecking at a morsel. She wore her hair scraped back as always,
gripped into a severe bun behind her head.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the light of the candles, for he had
switched off the too-bright lamp above the table, Karim was darkly handsome and
courteous as ever. He refilled her wineglass all the time, so that she consumed
far more than the occasional glass that she normally permitted herself from
time to time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The effect of the food, the wine, the candles,
the music, and the company of her young friend slowly corroded the defenses of
her reserve.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Over the empty plates, Karim leaned forward and
gazed into her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Edith?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“May I ask you something?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If you wish.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why do you wear your hair drawn back like
that?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was an impertinent question, personal. She
blushed more deeply.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I ... have always worn it like this.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No, that was not true. There was a time, she
recalled, with Horst, when it had flowed about her shoulders, thick and brown,
in the summer of 1970. There was a time when it had blown in the wind on the
lake at the Schlosspark in Laxenburg.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Karim rose without a word and walked behind
her. She felt a rising panic. This was preposterous. Skillful fingers eased the
big tortoiseshell comb out of her bun. This must stop. She felt the bobby pins
withdrawn, her hair coming undone, falling down her back. She sat rigid at her
place. The same fingers lifted her hair and drew it forward to fall on either
side of her face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Karim stood beside her, and she looked up. He
held out two hands and smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s better. You look ten years younger and
prettier. Let’s sit on the sofa. You pick your favorite piece for the record
player and I’ll make coffee. Deal?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Without permission, he took her small hands and
lifted her up from her seat. Letting one hand drop, he led her out of the
alcove into the sitting room. Then he turned into the kitchen, releasing her
other hand as he did so.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Thank God he had done that. She was shaking
from head to toe. Theirs was supposed to be a platonic friendship. But then, he
had not touched her, not really touched her. She would, of course, never permit
<i>that sort of thing</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She caught sight of herself in a mirror on the
wall, pink and flushed, hair about her shoulders, covering her ears, framing
her face. She thought she caught half a glimpse of a girl she had known twenty
years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She took a grip on herself and chose a record.
Her beloved Strauss, the waltzes every note of which she knew, “Roses from the
South,” “Vienna Woods,” “Skaters,” “Danube” ... Thank goodness he was in the
kitchen and did not see her nearly drop it as she placed it on the turntable.
He seemed to have great ease in finding the coffee, the water, the filters, the
sugar.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She sat at one far end of the sofa when he
joined her, knees together, coffee on her lap. She wanted to talk about the
concert scheduled for the Musikverein next week, but the words did not come.
She sipped her coffee instead.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Edith, please don’t be frightened of me,” he
murmured. “I am your friend, no?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t be silly. Of course I’m not frightened.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good. Because I will never hurt you, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Friend. Yes, they were friends, a friendship
born of a mutual love of music, art, opera, culture. Nothing more, surely. Such
a small gap, friend to boyfriend. She knew that the other secretaries at the
bank had husbands and boyfriends, watched them excited before going out on a
date, giggling in the hall the morning after, pitying her for being so alone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s ‘Roses from the South,’ isn’t it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think it’s my favorite of all the waltzes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mine too.” That was better—back to music.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He took her coffee cup from her lap and put it
beside his own on a side table. Then he rose, took her hands, and pulled her to
her feet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What ...?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She found her right hand taken in his left, a
strong and persuasive arm around her waist, and she was turning gently on the
strip-pine flooring of the small space between the furniture, dancing a waltz.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gidi Barzilai would have said, go for it, boychick,
don’t waste any more time. What did he know? Nothing. First the trust, then the
fall. Karim kept his right hand well up Edith’s back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As they turned, several inches of space between
them, Karim brought their locked hands closer to his shoulder, and with his
right arm he eased Edith nearer to his body. It was imperceptible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Edith found her face against his chest and had
to turn her face sideways. Her small bosom was against his body, and she could
sense that man-smell again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She pulled away. He let her, released her right
hand, and used his left to tilt her chin upward. Then he kissed her, as they
danced.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not a salacious kiss. He kept his lips
together, made no effort to force hers apart. Her mind was a rush of thoughts
and sensations, an airplane out of control, spinning, falling, protests rising
to fight and failing. The bank, Gemütlich, her reputation, his youth, his
foreignness, their ages, the warmth, the wine, the odor, the strength, the
lips. The music stopped. If he had done anything else, she would have thrown
him out. He took his lips from hers and eased her head forward until it rested
against his chest. They stayed motionless like that in the silent apartment for
several seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was she who pulled away. She turned to the
sofa and sat down, staring ahead of her. She found him on his knees in front of
her. He took both her hands in his.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Are you angry with me, Edith?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You shouldn’t have done that,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I didn’t mean to. I swear it. I couldn’t help
it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think you should go.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Edith, if you are angry and you want to punish
me, there is only one way you can. By not letting me see you again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, I’m not sure.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Please say you’ll let me see you again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If you say no, I’ll abandon the study course
and go home. I couldn’t live in Vienna if you won’t see me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t be silly. You must study.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then you will see me again?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was gone five minutes later. She put out the
lights, changed into her prim cotton nightdress, scrubbed her face and brushed
her teeth, and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the darkness she lay with her knees drawn
close to her chest. After two hours she did something she had not done for
years: She smiled in the darkness. There was a mad thought going through her
mind over and over again, and she did not mind. I have a boyfriend. He is ten
years younger, a student, a foreigner, an Arab, and a Moslem. And I don’t mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Colonel Dick Beatty of the USAF was on the graveyard shift
that night, deep below Old Airport Road in Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Black Hole never stopped, it never
slackened, and in the first days of the air war, it was working harder and
faster than ever.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Chuck Horner’s master plan for the air
war was experiencing the dislocation caused by the diversion of hundreds of his
warplanes to hunt Scud launchers instead of taking out the targets preassigned
to them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Any combat general will confirm that a plan can
be worked out to the last nut and bolt, but when the balloon goes up, it is
never quite like that. The crisis caused by the rockets dropping onto Israel
was proving a serious problem. Tel Aviv was screaming at Washington, and
Washington was screaming at Riyadh. The diversion of all those warplanes to
hunt the elusive mobile launchers was the price Washington had to pay to keep
Israel out of retaliatory action, and Washington’s orders did not brook
argument. Everyone could see that Israel losing patience and its entering the
war would prove disastrous for the frail Coalition now ranged against Iraq, but
the problem was still major.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Targets originally slated for day three were
being deferred for lack of aircraft, and the effect was like dominoes. A
further problem was that there could still be no Bomb Damage Assessment, or
BDA. It was essential, and it had to be done. The alternative could be appalling.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>BDAs were crucial because the Black Hole had to
know the level of the success, or lack of it, of each day’s wave of air
strikes. If a major Iraqi command center, radar emplacement, or missile battery
were on the Air Tasking Order, it would duly be attacked. But had it been
destroyed? If so, to what degree? Ten percent, fifty percent, or a pile of
smoking rubble? Simply to assume that the Iraqi base had been wiped out was no
good. The next day, unsuspecting Allied planes might be sent over that site on
another mission. If the place were still functioning, pilots could die.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So each day the missions were flown, and the
tired pilots described exactly what they had done and what they had hit. Or
thought they had hit. The next day, other airplanes flew over the targets and
photographed them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Thus, each day as the Air Tasking Order began
its three-day passage to preparation, the original menu of designated targets
had to include the second visit missions, to finish the jobs only partly done.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>January 20, the fourth day of the air war, the
Allied air forces had not officially gotten around to wasting the industrial
plants tagged as those making weapons of mass destruction. They were still
concentrating on SEAD—Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, Colonel Beatty was preparing the
list of the next day’s photoreconnaissance missions on the basis of the harvest
of all those debriefing sessions with squadron intelligence officers. By
midnight, he was nearly through, and the early orders were already speeding
their way to the various squadrons assigned to photorecon missions at dawn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then there’s this, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a chief petty officer, U.S. Navy, by his
side. The colonel glanced at the target.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you mean, Tarmiya?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s what it says, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So where the hell’s Tarmiya anyway?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Here, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The colonel glanced at the air map. The
location meant nothing to him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Radar? Missiles, air base, command post?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, sir. Industrial facility.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The colonel was tired. It had been a long
night, and it would go on until dawn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“For chrissake, we haven’t gotten to
industrials yet. Give me the list anyway.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He ran his eye down the list. It included every
industrial facility known to the Allies that was dedicated to the production of
weapons of mass destruction; it had factories known to produce shells,
explosives, vehicles, gun parts, and tank spares.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the first category were listed Al Qaim,
As-Sharqat, Tuwaitha, Fallujah, Al-Hillah, Al-Atheer, and Al-Furat. The colonel
could not know that missing from the list was Rashadia, where the Iraqis had
installed their second gas centrifuge cascade for producing refined uranium,
the problem that had eluded the experts on the Medusa Committee. That plant,
discovered by the United Nations much later, was not buried but disguised as a
water-bottling enterprise.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nor could Colonel Beatty know that Al-Furat was
the buried location of the first uranium cascade, the one visited by the
German, Dr. Stemmler, “somewhere near Tuwaitha,” and that its exact position
had been given away by Jericho.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t see any Tarmiya,” he grunted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, sir. It’s not there,” said the CPO.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Give me the grid reference.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No one could expect the analysts to memorize
hundreds of confusing Arab place names, the more so as in some cases a single
name covered ten separate targets, so all targets were given a grid reference
by the Global Positioning System, which pinned them down to twelve digits, a
square fifty yards by fifty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he bombed the huge factory at Tarmiya, Don
Walker had noted that reference, which was attached to his debriefing report.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s not here,” protested the colonel. “It’s
not even a goddam target. Who zapped it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Some pilot from the 336th at Al Kharz. Missed
out on his first two assigned targets through no fault of his own. Didn’t want
to come home with full racks, I guess.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Asshole,” muttered the colonel. “Okay, give it
to BDA anyway. But low priority. Don’t waste film on it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Lieutenant Commander Darren Cleary sat at the controls of
his F-14 Tomcat. He was a very frustrated man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beneath him the great gray bulk of the carrier
USS <i>Ranger</i> had her nose into the light breeze and was making
twenty-seven knots through the water. The sea of the northern Gulf was dead
calm in the predawn, and the sky would soon be bright and blue. It ought to
have been a day of pleasure for a young Navy pilot flying one of the world’s
best fighter planes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nicknamed “the Fleet Defender,” the twin-finned
two-man Tomcat had come to a wider audience when it starred in the film <i>Top
Gun</i>. Its cockpit is probably the most sought-after chair in American combat
aviation, certainly in Navy flying, and to be at the controls of such an
airplane on such a lovely day just a week after arriving on station in the Gulf
should have made Darren Cleary very happy. The reason for his misery was that
he was assigned not to a combat mission but to BDA, “taking happy snapshots,”
as he had complained the night before. He had beseeched the squadron operations
officer to let him go hunting MiGs, but to no avail.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Someone’s got to do it,” was his answer. Like
all air-superiority combat pilots among the Allies in the Gulf War, Cleary
feared that the Iraqi jets would leave the skies after a few days, putting an
end to any chance to tangle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So to his chagrin, he had been “fragged”—assigned—to
a TARPS mission.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Behind him and his flight officer, two General
Electric jet engines rumbled away as the deck crew hooked him up the steam
catapult on the angled flight deck, pointing his nose slightly off the
centerline of the <i>Ranger</i>. Cleary waited, throttle in his left hand,
control column steady and neutral in his right, as the last preparations were
made. Finally the terse inquiry, the nod, and that great blast of power as the
throttle went forward, right through the gate into afterburn, and the catapult
threw him and 68,000 pounds of warplane from zero to 150 knots in three
seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The gray steel of the <i>Ranger</i> vanished
behind him, and the dark sea flashed below. The Tomcat felt for the rushing air
around her, sensed its support, and climbed smoothly away for the lightening
sky.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It would be a four-hour mission with two
refuels. He had twelve targets to photograph, and he would not be alone.
Already up ahead of him was an A-6 Avenger with laser-guided bombs in case they
should run into antiaircraft artillery, in which eventuality the Avenger would
teach the Iraqi gunners to be quiet. An EA-6B Prowler was coming on the same
mission, armed with HARMs in case they ran into a SAM missile site guided by
radar. The Prowler would use its HARMs to blow away the radar, and the Avenger
would employ its bombs on the missiles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In case the Iraqi Air Force showed up, two more
Tomcats would be riding shotgun, above and to either side of the photographer,
their powerful AWG-9 in-air radars capable of discerning the Iraqi pilot’s
inside leg measurement before he got out of bed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All this metal and technology was to protect
what hung below and behind Darren Cleary’s feet, a Tactical Air Reconnaissance
Pod System, or TARPS. Hanging slightly right of the Tomcat’s centerline, the
TARPS resembled a streamlined coffin seventeen feet long. It was rather more
complicated than a tourist’s Pentax.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In its nose was a powerful frame camera with
two positions: forward-and-down, or straight down. Behind it was the panoramic
camera looking outward, sideways, and down. Behind that was the infrared
Reconnaissance Set, designed to record thermal (heat) imaging and its source.
In a final twist, the pilot could see on his Head-Up Display inside his cockpit
what he was photographing while still overhead.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Darren Cleary climbed to fifteen thousand feet,
met up with the rest of his escorts, and they proceeded to link with their
assigned KC-135 tanker just south of the Iraqi border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Without being troubled by Iraqi resistance,
Cleary photographed the eleven principal targets he had been assigned, then
turned back over Tarmiya for the secondary-interest twelfth location.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As he went over Tarmiya, he glanced at his
display and muttered, “What the fuck is that?” This was the moment the last of
the 750 frames in each of his main cameras chose to run out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After a second refuel the mission landed back
on the <i>Ranger</i> without incident. The deck crew downloaded the cameras and
took them off to the photo lab for development to negatives.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Cleary was debriefed on an uneventful mission,
then went down to the light table with the intelligence officer. As the
negatives came up on the screen with the white-light underneath, Cleary
explained what each frame was and where it had come from. The intel officer
made notes for his own report, which would be attached to Cleary’s, plus the
photos.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they came to the last twenty frames, the
intel officer asked, “What are these?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t ask me,” said Cleary. “They come from
that target at Tarmiya. You remember—the one Riyadh tacked on at the last
moment?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yeah. So what are those things inside the
factory?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look like Frisbees for giants,” suggested
Cleary dubiously.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a phrase that stuck. The intel officer
used it in his own report, coupled with an admission that he had not the slightest
idea what they were. When the package was complete, a Lockheed S-3 Viking was
thrown off the <i>Ranger</i>’s deck and took the whole package to Riyadh.
Darren Cleary went back to air combat missions, never tangled with the elusive
MiGs, and left the Gulf with the USS <i>Ranger</i> in late April 1991.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Wolfgang Gemütlich was becoming more and more worried,
through that morning, by the state of his private secretary.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was as polite and formal as ever and as
efficient as he could have demanded—and Herr Gemütlich demanded much. Not a man
of excessive sensitivity, he saw nothing out of the ordinary at first, but by
her third visit into his private sanctum to take a letter, he observed there
was something unusual about her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nothing lighthearted, of course, and certainly
not frivolous—he would never have tolerated that. It was an air that she
carried with her. On her third visit he observed her more closely as, head bent
over her note pad, she took down his dictation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>True, the dowdy business suit was in place, hem
below the knees. The hair was still scraped back into a bun behind her head.
... It was on the fourth visit that he realized with a start of horror that
Edith Hardenberg was wearing a touch of face powder. Not a lot, just a hint. He
checked quickly to ensure that there was no lipstick on her mouth and was
relieved to see not a trace.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Perhaps, he reasoned, he was deluding himself.
It was January, the freezing weather outside might have caused chapping to her
skin; no doubt the powder was to ease the soreness. But there was something
else.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The eyes. Not mascara—<i>um Gotteswillen</i>,
let it not be mascara. He checked again, but there was none. He had been
deluded, he reassured himself. It was in the lunch hour as he spread his linen
napkin on his blotter and ate the sandwiches dutifully prepared by Frau Gemütlich,
as on every day, that the solution came to him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They sparkled. Fräulein Hardenberg’s eyes
sparkled. It could not be the winter weather—she had been indoors for four
hours by then. The banker put down his half-eaten sandwich and realized he had
seen the same syndrome among some of the younger secretaries just before
going-home time on a Friday evening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was happiness. Edith Hardenberg was actually
happy. It showed, he realized now, in the way she walked, the way she talked,
and the way she looked. She had been like that all morning—that, and the hint
of powder. It was enough to trouble Wolfgang Gemütlich deeply. He hoped she had
not been spending money.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The snapshots taken by Lieutenant Commander Darren Cleary
came into Riyadh in the afternoon, part of a blizzard of fresh images that
poured into CENTAF headquarters every day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Some of those images were from the KH-11 and
KH-12 satellites high above the earth, giving the big-dimension picture, the
wide angle, the whole of Iraq. If they showed no variation from the previous
day, they were stacked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Others were from the constant photorecon
missions flown at lower levels by the TR-1s. Some showed Iraqi activity,
military or industrial, that was new—troop movements, war-planes taxiing where
they had not been before, missile launchers in new locations. These went to
Target Analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The ones from the <i>Ranger</i>’s Tomcat were
for Bomb Damage Assessment. They were filtered through the Barn, the collection
of green tents on the edge of the military air base; then, duly tagged and
identified, they went down the road to the Black Hole, where they landed in the
BDA department.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty came on duty at seven that
evening. He worked for two hours poring over shots of a missile site (partially
destroyed, two batteries apparently still intact) and a communications center
(reduced to rubble), plus an array of hardened aircraft shelters that housed
Iraqi MiGs, Mirages, and Sukhois (shattered).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he came to a dozen pictures of a factory
at Tarmiya, he frowned, rose, and walked over to a desk manned by a British
flight sergeant of the Royal Air Force.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Charlie, what are these?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Tarmiya, sir. You recall that factory hit by a
Strike Eagle yesterday—the one that wasn’t on the list?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, yeah, the factory that was never even a
target?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the one. A Tomcat from the <i>Ranger</i>
took these just after ten this morning.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty tapped the photos in his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So what the hell’s going on down here?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t know, sir. That’s why I put ’em on your
desk. No one can work it out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, that Eagle jockey certainly rattled
someone’s cage. They’re going apeshit here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The American colonel and the British NCO stared
at the images brought back by the Tomcat from Tarmiya. They were utterly clear,
the definition fantastic. Some were from the forward-and-down frame camera in
the nose of the TARPS pod showing the ruined factory as the Tomcat approached
at fifteen thousand feet; others from the panoramic camera in the midsection of
the pod. The men at the Barn had extracted the dozen best and clearest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How big is this factory?” asked the colonel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“About a hundred meters by sixty, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The giant roof had been torn off, and only a
fragment was left covering a quarter of the floor space of the Iraqi plant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the three-quarters that had been exposed to
view, the entire factory layout could be observed in a bird’s-eye view. There
were subdivisions caused by partitions, and in each division a great dark disk
occupied most of the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“These metal?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, sir, according to the infrared scanner.
Steel of some kind.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even more intriguing, and the reason for all
the attention by the BDA people, was the Iraqi reaction to Don Walker’s raid.
Around the roofless factory were grouped not one but five enormous cranes,
their booms poised over the interior like storks pecking at a morsel. With all
the damage going on in Iraq, cranes this size were at a premium.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Around the factory and inside it, a swarm of
laborers could be seen toiling to attach the disks to the crane hooks for
removal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You counted these guys, Charlie?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Over two hundred, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And these disks”—Colonel Beatty consulted the
report of the <i>Ranger</i>’s Intel officer—“these ‘Frisbees for giants’?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No idea, sir. Never seen anything like them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, they’re sure as hell important to Mr.
Saddam Hussein. Is Tarmiya really a no-target zone?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, that’s the way it’s been listed,
Colonel. But would you have a look at this?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The flight sergeant pulled over another photo
he had retrieved from the files. The colonel peered where the NCO pointed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Chain-link fencing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Double chain-link. And here?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty took the magnifying glass and
looked again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mined strip ... triple-A batteries ... guard
towers. Where did you find all these, Charlie?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Here. Take a big-picture look.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty stared at the fresh picture
placed before him, an ultrahigh-altitude shot of the whole of Tarmiya and the
surrounding area. Then he breathed out in a long exhalation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Jesus H. Christ, we’re going to have to
reevaluate the whole of Tarmiya. How the hell did we miss it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fact was, the whole of the 381-building
industrial complex of Tarmiya had been cleared by the first analysts as
nonmilitary and nontarget for reasons that later became part of the folklore of
the human moles who worked in and survived the Black Hole.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were Americans and British, and they were
all NATO men. Their training had been in assessing Soviet targets, and they
looked for the Soviet way of doing things. The clues they looked for were the standard
indicators. If the building or complex was military and important, it would be
off-limits. It would be guarded from trespassers and protected from attack.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Were there guard towers, chain-link fencing,
triple-A batteries, missiles, mined strips, barracks? Were there signs of heavy
trucks going in and out; were there heavy-duty power lines or a designated
generating station inside the enclosure? These signs meant a target. Tarmiya
had none of these—apparently.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What the RAF sergeant had done, on a hunch, was
to reexamine a very high-angle picture of the entire area. And there it was—the
fence, the batteries, the barracks, the reinforced gates, the missiles, the
razor-wire entanglements, the mined strip. But far away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iraqis had simply taken a vast tract of
land one hundred kilometers square and fenced off the lot. No such land-grab
would have been possible in Western or even Eastern Europe.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The industrial complex, of whose 381 buildings
seventy later turned out to be dedicated to war production, lay at the center
of the square, widely scattered to avoid bomb damage, but still only five
hundred acres out of the ten thousand in the protected zone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Electrical power lines?” said the colonel. “There’s
nothing here that would power more than a toothbrush.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Over here, sir. Forty-five kilometers to the
west. The power lines run in the opposite direction. Fifty quid to a pint of
warm beer, those power lines are phony. The real cable will be buried
underground and run from the power station into the heart of Tarmiya. That’s a
hundred-fifty-megawatt generating station, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Son of a bitch,” breathed the colonel. Then he
straightened up and grabbed the sheaf of photographs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good job, Charlie. I’m taking all these in to
Buster Glosson. Meanwhile, there’s no need to wait around on that roofless
factory. If it’s important to the Iraqis—we blow it away.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, sir. I’ll put it on the list.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not for three days from now. Tomorrow. What’s
free?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The flight sergeant went to a computer console
and tapped out the inquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nothing, sir. Booked solid, every unit.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can’t we divert a squadron?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not really. Because of the Scud-hunting, we
have a backlog. Oh, hold on, there’s the Forty-three Hundred down at Diego.
They have capacity.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay, give it to the Buffs.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If you’ll forgive my saying so,” remarked the
NCO, with that elaborately courteous phrasing that masks a disagreement, “the
Buffs are not exactly precision bombers.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, Charlie, in twenty-four hours those
Iraqis will have cleaned the place out. We have no choice. Give it to the Buffs.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin was too restless to hole up in the Soviet
compound for more than a few days. The Russian steward and his wife were
distraught, sleepless at night because of the endless cacophony of falling
bombs and rockets coupled with the roar of Baghdad’s limitless but largely
ineffective antiaircraft fire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They yelled imprecations out of the windows at
all American and British fliers, but they were also running out of food, and
the Russian stomach is a compelling argument. The solution was to send Mahmoud
the gardener to do their shopping again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had been pedaling around the city for
three days when he saw the chalk mark. It was on the rear wall of one of the
old Khayat houses in Karadit-Mariam, and it meant that Jericho had delivered a
package to the corresponding dead-letter box.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Despite the bombing, the natural resilience of
ordinary people trying to get on with their lives had begun to assert itself.
Without a word being spoken, save in muttered undertones and then only to a
family member who would not betray the speaker to the AMAM, the realization had
dawned on the working class that the Sons of Dogs and the Sons of Naji seemed
to be able to hit what they wanted to hit and leave the rest alone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After five days the Presidential Palace was a
heap of rubble. The Defense Ministry no longer existed, nor did the telephone
exchange or the principal generating station. Even more inconveniently, all
nine bridges now decorated the bottom of the Tigris, but an array of small
entrepreneurs had established ferry services across the river, some large
enough to take trucks and cars, some punts carrying ten passengers and their
bicycles, some mere rowboats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Most major buildings remained untouched. The
Rashid Hotel in Karch was still stuffed with foreign press people, even though
the Rais was assuredly in his bunker beneath it. Even worse, the headquarters
of the AMAM, a collection of linked houses with old frontages and modernized
interiors in a blocked-off street near Qasr-el-Abyad in Risafa, was safe.
Beneath two of those houses was the Gymnasium, never mentioned except in
whispers, where Omar Khatib the Tormentor extracted his confessions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Across the river in Mansour, the single big
office building forming the headquarters of the Mukhabarat, both Foreign and
Counterintelligence, was unmarked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin considered the problem of the chalk
mark as he cycled back to the Soviet villa. He knew his orders were formal—no
approach. Had he been a Chilean diplomat called Benz Moncada he would have
obeyed that instruction, and he would have been right. But Moncada had not been
trained to lie immobile, if necessary for days, in a single observation post
and watch the surrounding countryside until even the birds nested on his hat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, on foot, Martin recrossed the river
into Risafa as the air raids began and made his way to the vegetable market at
Kasra. There were figures on the sidewalks here and there, scurrying toward
shelter as if their humble dwellings would ward off a Tomahawk cruise and he
were merely one of them. More important, his gamble regarding the AMAM patrols
was paying off: they too had no taste for the open streets with the Americans
overhead.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He found his observation position on the roof
of a fruit warehouse, from whose edge he could see the street, the wall of the
vegetable market, and the brick and the flagstone that marked the drop. For
eight hours, from eight <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> until four
in the morning, he lay and watched.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the drop were staked out, the AMAM would not
have used less than twenty men. In all that time there would have been the
scuffle of a boot on stone, a cough, a shifting of cramped muscles, a scrape of
match, the glow of a cigarette, the guttural order to stub it out; there would
have been something. He simply did not believe that Khatib’s or Rahmani’s
people could remain immobile and silent for eight hours.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just before four <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>,
the bombing stopped. There were no lights in the market below. He checked again
for a camera mounted in a high window, but there were no high windows in the
area. At ten past four he slipped off his roof, crossed the alley, a piece of
blackness in a dark gray <i>dish-dash</i> moving through blackness, found the
brick, removed the message, and was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He came over the wall of First Secretary
Kulikov’s compound just before dawn and was in his shack before anyone stirred.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The message from Jericho was simple: He had
heard nothing for nine days. He had seen no chalk marks. Since his last message
there had been no contact. No fee had arrived in his bank account. Yet his
message had been retrieved; he knew this because he had checked. What was
wrong?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin did not transmit the message to Riyadh.
He knew he should not have disobeyed orders, but he believed that he, not
Paxman, was the man on the spot and he had the right to make some decisions for
himself. His risk that night had been a calculated one; he had been pitting his
skills against men he knew to be inferior at the covert game. Had there been
one hint the alley was under surveillance, he would have been gone as he had
come, and no one would have seen him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was possible that Paxman was right and
Jericho was compromised. It was also possible Jericho had simply been
transmitting what he had heard Saddam Hussein say. The sticking point was the
million dollars that the CIA refused to pay. Martin crafted his own reply.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He said that there had been problems caused by
the start of the air war but that nothing was wrong that a little more patience
would not sort out. He told Jericho that the last message had indeed been
picked up and transmitted, but that he, Jericho, as a man of the world, would
realize that a million dollars was a very large sum and that the information
had to be checked out. This would take a little longer. Jericho should keep cool
in these troubled times and wait for the next chalk mark to alert him to a
resumption of their arrangement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During the day Martin lodged the message behind
the brick in the wall by the stagnant moat of the citadel in Aadhamiya, and in
the dusk made, his chalk mark on the rusty red surface of the garage door in
Yarmuk.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Twenty-four hours later, the chalk mark had
been expunged. Each night Martin tuned in to Riyadh but nothing came. He knew
his orders were to escape from Baghdad and that his controllers were probably
waiting for him to cross the border. He decided to wait it out a little longer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Diego Garcia is not one of the world’s most visited
places. It happens to be a tiny island, little more than a coral atoll, at the
bottom of the Chagos archipelago in the southern Indian Ocean. Once a British
territory, it has for years been leased to the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Despite its isolation, during the Gulf War it
played host to the hastily assembled 4300th Bomb Wing of the USAF, flying B-52
Stratofortresses.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The B-52 was arguably the oldest veteran in the
war, having been in service for over thirty years. For many of those, it had
been the backbone of Strategic Air Command, headquartered at Omaha, Nebraska,
the great flying mastodon that circled the periphery of the Soviet empire day
and night packing thermonuclear warheads.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Old the B-52 may have been, but it remained a
fearsome bomber, and in the Gulf War the updated G version was used to
devastating effect on the dug-in troops of Iraq’s so-called elite Republican
Guard in the deserts of southern Kuwait. If the cream of the Iraqi Army came
out of their bunkers haggard and with arms raised during the Coalition ground
offensive, it was in part because their nerves had been shattered and their
morale broken by around-the-clock pounding from B-52s.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were only eighty of these bombers in the
war, but so great is their carrying capacity and so enormous their bomb-load
that they dropped 26,000 tons of ordnance, forty percent of the entire tonnage
dropped in the war.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They are so big that in repose on the ground,
their wings, supporting eight Pratt and Whitney J-57 engines in four pods of
two, droop toward the ground. On takeoff with a full load, the wings become
airborne first, seeming to lift above the great hull like those of a gull. Only
in flight do they stick straight out to the side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of the reasons they cast such terror into
the Republican Guard in the desert was that they fly out of sight and sound, so
high that their bombs arrive without any warning and are the more frightening
for it. But if they are good carpet bombers, pinpoint accuracy is not their
strong point, as the flight sergeant had tried to point out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At dawn of January 22, three Buffs lifted off
from Diego Garcia and headed toward Saudi Arabia. Each carried its maximum
payload, fifty-one 750-pound dumb bombs prone to fall where they will from
thirty-five thousand feet. Twenty-seven bombs were housed internally, the rest
on racks under each wing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three bombers constituted the usual cell
for Buff operations, and their crews had been looking forward to a day fishing,
swimming, and snorkeling on the reef of their tropical hideaway. With
resignation, they plotted their course for a faraway factory that they had
never seen and never would.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The B-52 Stratofortress is not called the Buff
because it is painted a tan or dun-brown color. The word is not even a
derivation of the first two syllables of its number—<i>Bee-Fif</i>ty Two. It
just stands for Big Ugly Fat Fucker.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So the Buffs plodded their way northward, found
Tarmiya, picked up the image of the designated factory, and dropped all 153
bombs. Then they went home to the Chagos archipelago.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the morning of the twenty-third, about the
time London and Washington began to yell for more pictures of these mysterious
Frisbees, a further BDA mission was assigned, but this time the photo-call was
carried out by a recon Phantom flown by the Alabama Air National Guard out of
Sheikh Isa base on Bahrain, known locally as Shakey’s Pizza.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In a remarkable break with tradition, the Buffs
had actually hit the target. Where the Frisbee factory had been was a vast
gaping crater. Washington and London had to be satisfied with the dozen
pictures they had from Lieutenant Commander Darren Cleary.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The best analysts in the Black Hole had seen
the pictures, shrugged their ignorance, and sent them to their superiors in the
two capital cities.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Copies went at once to JARIC, the British
photointerpretation center, and in Washington to ENPIC.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Those passing this drab, square brick-built
building on a corner in a seedy and run-down precinct of downtown Washington
would be unlikely to guess what goes on inside. The only clue to the National
Photographic Interpretation Center comes from the complex exhaust flues for the
air conditioning inside, which keep at controlled temperatures an awesome
battery of the most powerful computers in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For the rest, the dust- and rain-streaked
windows, the un-imposing door, and the trash blowing down the street outside
might suggest a not very prosperous warehouse.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But it is here that the images taken by those
satellites come; it is the analysts who work here who tell the men at the
National Reconnaissance Office and the Pentagon and the CIA exactly what it is
that all those expensive “birds” have seen. They are good, those analysts,
up-to-the-minute in their grasp of technology, young, bright, and brainy. But
they had never seen any disks like those Frisbees at Tarmiya. So they filed the
photos and said so.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Experts at the Pentagon in Washington and at the Ministry
of Defence in London, who knew just about every conventional weapon since the
crossbow, examined the pictures, shook their heads, and handed them back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In case they had anything to do with weapons of
mass destruction, they were shown to scientists at Sandia, Los Alamos, and
Lawrence Livermore in America and at Porton Down, Harwell, and Aldermaston in
England. The result was the same.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The best suggestion was that the disks were
part of big electrical transformers destined for a new Iraqi power-generating
station. That was the explanation that had to be settled for, when the request
for more pictures from Riyadh was answered with the news that the Tarmiya
factory had literally ceased to exist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a very good explanation, but it failed
to elucidate one problem: Why were the Iraqi authorities in the pictures trying
so desperately to cover or rescue them?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not until the evening of the
twenty-fourth that Simon Paxman, speaking from a phone booth, called Dr. Terry
Martin at his flat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Care for another Indian meal?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can’t tonight,” said Martin. “I’m packing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He did not mention that Hilary was back, and he
also wished to spend the evening with his friend.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where are you going?” asked Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“America,” said Martin. “An invitation to
lecture on the Abassid Caliphate. Rather flattering, actually. They seem to
like my research into the law structure of the third caliph. Sorry.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s just that something else has come through
from the south. Another puzzle that nobody can explain. But it’s not about
nuances of the Arabic language, it’s technical. Still ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A photo. I’ve run off a copy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin hesitated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Another straw in the wind?” he asked. “All
right, same restaurant. At eight.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s probably all it is,” said Paxman, “just
another straw.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What he did not know was that what he held in
his hand in that freezing phone booth was a very large piece of string.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942768">Chapter 17</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Terry Martin landed at San Francisco International Airport
just after three <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> local time the following
day, to be met by his host, Professor Paul Maslowski, genial and welcoming in
the American academic’s uniform of tweed jacket and leather patches, and at
once felt himself enveloped by the warm embrace of all-American hospitality.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Betty and I figured a hotel would be kind of
impersonal and wondered whether you’d prefer to stay with us?” said Maslowski
as he steered his compact out of the airport complex and onto the highway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you, that would be wonderful,” said
Martin, and he meant it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The students are looking forward to hearing
you, Terry. There aren’t many of us, of course—our Arab department must be
smaller than yours at SOAS, but they’re really enthusiastic.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Great. I look forward to meeting them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pair chatted contentedly about their shared
passion, medieval Mesopotamia, until they arrived at Professor Maslowski’s
frame house in a suburban development in Menlo Park.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There he met Paul’s wife, Betty, and was shown
to a warm and comfortable guest room. He glanced at his watch: a quarter before
five.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Could I use the phone?” he asked as he came
downstairs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Absolutely,” said Maslowski. “Do you want to
phone home?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, locally. Do you have a directory?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The professor gave him the telephone book and
left.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was under Livermore: Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, in Alameda County. He was just in time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Could you put me through to Department Z?” he
asked, pronouncing it <i>Zed</i>, when the receptionist answered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Who?” asked the girl.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Department <i>Zee</i>,” Martin corrected
himself. “Director’s office.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hold on, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Another female voice came on the line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Director’s office. Can I help you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The British accent probably helped. Martin
explained he was Dr. Martin, an academic over from England on a brief visit,
and would be grateful to speak with the Director. A male voice took the phone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dr. Martin?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m Jim Jacobs, Deputy Director. How can I
help you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, I know it’s terribly short notice. But I
am over here on a quick visit to give a lecture to the Near Eastern studies
department at Berkeley. Then I have to fly back. Fact is, I was wondering
whether I might come out to Livermore to see you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sense of puzzlement came right over the
telephone wire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Could you give me some indication what this is
about, Dr. Martin?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, not easily. I am a member of the British
end of the Medusa Committee. Does that ring a bell?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sure does. We’re about to close down right
now. Would tomorrow suit you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Perfectly. I have to lecture in the afternoon.
Would the morning be all right?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Say ten o’clock?” asked Dr. Jacobs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The appointment was made. Martin had adroitly
avoided mentioning that he was not a nuclear physicist at all, but an Arabist.
No need to complicate matters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That night, across the world in Vienna, Karim took Edith
Hardenberg to bed. His seduction was neither hurried nor clumsy but seemed to
follow an evening of concert music and dinner with perfect naturalness. Even as
she drove him back from the city center to her apartment in Grinzing, Edith
tried to convince herself it would just be for a coffee and a good-night kiss,
though deep inside she knew she was pretending.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he took her in his arms and kissed her
gently but persuasively, she just allowed him to; her earlier conviction that
she would protest seemed to melt away, and she could not prevent it. Nor, deep
inside, did she want to anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he swept her up and carried her through to
her tiny bedroom, she just turned her face into his shoulder and let it happen.
She hardly felt her severe little dress slip to the floor. His fingers had a
deftness that Horst had never possessed—no pushing and shoving and snagging of
zips and buttons.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was still in her slip when he joined her
beneath the <i>Bettkissen</i>, the big soft Viennese duvet, and the heat from
his hard young body was like a great comfort on a bitter winter’s night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She did not know what to do, so she closed her
eyes tight and let it happen. Strange, awful, sinful sensations began to run
through her unaccustomed nerves beneath the attentions of his lips and softly
searching fingers. Horst had never been like this.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She began to panic when his lips strayed from
her own and from her breasts and went to other places, bad, forbidden places,
what her mother had always referred to as “down there.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She tried to push him away, protesting feebly,
knowing the waves beginning to run through her lower body were not proper and
decent, but he was eager as a spaniel puppy on a downed partridge.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He took no notice of her repeated “<i>Nein</i>,
Karim, <i>das sollst du nicht</i>,” and the waves became a tidal flow and she
was a lost rowboat on a crazy ocean until the last great wave crashed over her
and she drowned in a sensation with which she had never once in her thirty-nine
years needed to burden the ears of her father confessor at the Votivkirche.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then she took his head in her arms and pressed
his face to her thin little breasts and rocked him in silence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Twice more during the night he made love to
her, once just after midnight and again in the blackness before dawn, and each
time he was so gentle and strong that her pent-up love came pouring to meet his
in a way she had never envisaged could be possible. Only after the second time
could she bring herself to run her hands over his body while he slept and
wonder at the sheen of the skin and the love that she felt for every inch of
it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Although he had no idea his guest had any interest in the
world other than Arab studies, Dr. Maslowski insisted that he drive Terry
Martin out to Livermore in the morning rather than go to the expense of a cab.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I guess I have a more important guy in my
house than I thought I had,” he suggested on the drive. But though Martin
expostulated that this was not so, the California scholar knew enough about the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory to know that not everyone blew in there on a
phone call. Dr. Maslowski, with masterly discretion, refrained from asking any
more questions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the main security gate uniformed guards
checked a list, examined Martin’s passport, made a phone call, and directed
them to a parking area.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll wait here,” said Maslowski.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Considering the work it does, the Laboratory is
an odd-looking collection of buildings on Vasco Road, some of them modern, but
many dating back to the days when it was an old military base. To add to the
conglomeration of styles, “temporary” buildings that have somehow become
permanent are slotted between the old barracks. Martin was led to a group of
offices on the East Avenue side of the complex.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It does not look like much, but it is out of
this cluster of buildings that a group of scientists monitor the spread of
nuclear technology across the Third World.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Jim Jacobs turned out to be little older than
Terry Martin, just under forty, a Ph.D., and a nuclear physicist. He welcomed
Martin into his paper-strewn office.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Cold morning. Bet you thought California was
going to be hot. Everyone does. Not up here, though. Coffee?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Love some.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sugar, cream?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, black, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dr. Jacobs pressed an intercom button.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sandy, could we have two coffees? Mine you
know. And one black.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He smiled across the desk at his visitor. He
did not bother to mention that he had talked with Washington to confirm the
English visitor’s name and that he really was a member of the Medusa Committee.
Someone on the American end of the committee, whom he knew, had checked a list
and confirmed the claim. Jacobs was impressed. The visitor might look young,
but he must be pretty high-powered over in England. The Deputy Director knew
all about Medusa because he and his colleagues had been consulted for weeks
about Iraq and had handed over everything they had, every detail of the story
of foolishness and neglect on the part of the West that had damn nearly given
Saddam Hussein a nuclear option.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So how can I help?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know it’s a long shot,” said Martin,
reaching into his attaché case. “But I suppose you have seen this already?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He laid a copy of one of the dozen pictures of
the Tarmiya factory on the desk, the one Paxman had disobediently given him.
Jacobs glanced at it and nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sure, had a dozen of them through from
Washington three, four days ago. What can I say? They don’t mean a thing. Can’t
say more to you than I said to Washington. Never seen anything like them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sandy came in with a tray of coffee, a bright
blond California woman full of self-assurance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hi, there,” she said to Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, er, hallo. Did the Director see these?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Jacobs frowned. The implication was that he
himself might not be senior enough. “The Director’s skiing in Colorado. But I
ran them past some of the best brains we have here, and believe me, they are
very, very good.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, I’m sure,” said Martin. Another blank
wall. Well, it had only been a long shot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sandy placed the cups of coffee on the desk.
Her eye fell on the photograph.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, them again,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, them again,” said Jacobs, and smiled
teasingly. “Dr. Martin here thinks maybe someone ... older should have a look
at them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well,” she said, “show ’em to Daddy Lomax.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With that she was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Who’s Daddy Lomax?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, take no notice. Used to work here. Retired
now, lives alone up in the mountains. Pops in now and then for old times’ sake.
The girls adore him, he brings them mountain flowers. Funny old guy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They drank their coffee, but there was little
more to say. Jacobs had work to do. He apologized once again for not being able
to help. Then he showed his visitor out, returned to his sanctum, and closed
the door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin waited in the corridor a few seconds,
then put his head around the door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where would I find Daddy Lomax?” he asked
Sandy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t know. Lives way up in the hills.
Nobody’s ever been there.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He has a phone?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, no lines go up there. But I think he has a
cellular. The insurance company insisted. I mean, he’s terribly old.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her face was creased with that genuine concern
that only California youth can show for anyone over sixty. She rifled through a
Rolodex and came up with a number. Martin noted it, thanked her, and left.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Ten time zones away, it was evening in Baghdad. Mike
Martin was on his bicycle, pedaling northwest up Port Said Street. He had just
passed the old British Club at what used to be called Southgate, and because he
recalled it from his boyhood, he turned to stare back at it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His lack of attention nearly caused an
accident. He had reached the edge of Nafura Square and without thinking pedaled
forward. There was a big limousine coming from his left and although
technically it did not have right of way, its two motorcycle escorts were
clearly not going to stop.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of them swerved violently to avoid the
clumsy <i>fellagha</i> with the vegetable basket attached to his pillion, the
motorcycle’s front wheel clipping the smaller bicycle and sending it crashing
to the tarmac.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin went down with his bicycle, sprawling on
the road, his vegetables spilling out. The limousine braked, paused, and
swerved around him before accelerating away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On his knees, Martin looked up as the car
passed. The face of the rear seat passenger stared out the window at the oaf
who had dared to delay him by a fraction of a second.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a cold face in the uniform of a brigadier
general, thin and acerbic, channels running down either side of the nose to
frame the bitter mouth. In that half-second, what Martin noticed were the eyes.
Not cold or angry eyes, not bloodshot red or shrewd or even cruel. Blank eyes,
utterly and completely blank, the eyes of death long gone. Then the face behind
the window had passed by.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He did not need the whisperings of the two
working men who pulled him to his feet and helped gather up his vegetables. He
had seen the face before, but dimly, blurred, taken on a saluting base, in a
photograph on a table in Riyadh weeks before. He had just seen the most feared
man in Iraq after the Rais, perhaps including the Rais. It was the one they
called Al-Mu’azib, the Tormentor, the extractor of confessions, head of the
AMAM, Omar Khatib.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Terry Martin tried the number he had been given during the
lunch hour. There was no reply, just the honeyed tones of the recorded voice
advising him: “The party you have called is not available or is out of range.
Please try your call later.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paul Maslowski had taken Martin to lunch with
his faculty colleagues on the campus. The conversation was lively and academic.
Over the meal Martin thanked his hosts again for their invitation and repeated
his appreciation of the endowment that had funded his visit. He tried the
number again after lunch on his way to Barrows Hall, guided by Near Eastern
Studies Director Kathlene Keller, but again there was no reply.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The lecture went across well. There were
twenty-seven graduate students, all heading for their doctorates, and Martin
was impressed at the level and depth of their understanding of the papers he
had written on the subject of the Caliphate that ruled central Mesopotamia in
what the Europeans call the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When one of the students rose to thank him for
coming all that way to talk to them and the rest had applauded, Terry Martin
went pink and bobbed his thanks to them. Afterward, he spotted a pay phone on
the wall in the lobby. This time there was an answer, and a gruff voice said:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yeah.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Excuse me, is that Dr. Lomax?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s only one, friend. That’s me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know this sounds crazy, but I’ve come from
England. I’d like to see you. My name’s Terry Martin.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“England, eh? Long ways away. What would you
want with an old coot like me, Mr. Martin?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Want to tap a long memory. Show you something.
People at Livermore say you’ve been around longer than most, seen just about
everything. I want to show you something. Difficult to explain on the phone.
Could I come up and see you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It ain’t a tax form?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Or a <i>Playboy</i> centerfold?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“ ’Fraid not.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now you got me curious. Do you know the way?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. I have pencil and paper. Can you describe
it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Daddy Lomax told him how to get to where he
lived. It took some time. Martin wrote it all down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Tomorrow morning,” said the retired physicist.
“Too late now, you’ll get lost in the dark. And you’ll need a four-wheel drive.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was one of the only two E-8A J-STARs in the Gulf War
that caught the signal that morning of January 27. The J-STARs had been still
experimental aircraft and were flying with largely civilian technicians on
board when they were rushed in early January from their base at the Grumman
Melbourne plant in Florida halfway across the world to Arabia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That morning, one of the two flying out of
Riyadh military air base was high over the Iraqi border, still inside Saudi air
space, peering with its Norden down-and-sideways radar more than a hundred
miles into the western desert of Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The plink was faint, but it indicated metal,
moving slowly, far into Iraq, a convoy no longer than two, maybe three trucks.
Still, that was what the J-STAR was there for, so the mission commander told
one of the AWACS circling over the northern end of the Red Sea, giving the
AWACS the exact position of the small Iraqi convoy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside the hull of the AWACS the mission
commander logged the precise spot and looked around for an airborne element
that might be available to give the convoy an unfriendly visit. All the western
desert operations were still keyed toward Scud-hunting at that time, apart from
the attention being given to the two huge Iraqi air bases called H2 and H3 that
were situated in those deserts. The J-STAR might have picked up a mobile
Scud-launcher, even though it would be unusual in daylight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The AWACS came up with an element of two F-15E
Strike Eagles coming south from Scud Alley North.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker was riding south at twenty thousand
feet after a mission to the outskirts of Al Qaim, where he and his wingman,
Randy Roberts, had just destroyed a fixed missile base protecting one of the
poison gas factories targeted for later destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker took the call and checked his fuel. It
was low. Worse, with his laser-guided bombs gone, his underwing pylons
contained only two Sidewinders and two Sparrows. But these were air-to-air
missiles in case they ran into Iraqi jets. Somewhere south of the border his
assigned refueling tanker was patiently waiting, and he would need every drop
to get back to Al Kharz. Still, the convoy location was only fifty miles away
and just fifteen off his intended track. Even though he had no ordnance left,
there was no harm in having a look.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His wingman had heard everything, so Walker
gestured through the canopy to the flier half a mile away through the clear
air, and the two Eagles rolled into a dive to their right.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At eight thousand feet, he could see the source
of the <i>plink</i> that had showed up on the screen of the J-STAR. It was not
a Scud-launcher, but two trucks and two BRDM-2s, Soviet-made light armored
vehicles on wheels, not tracks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From his perch, he could see much more than the
J-STAR could. Down in a deep wadi beneath him was a single Land-Rover. At five
thousand feet, he could see the four British SAS men around it, tiny ants on
the brown cloth of the desert. What <i>they</i> could not see were the four
Iraqi vehicles forming a horseshoe around them, nor the Iraqi soldiers pouring
down from the tailboards of the two trucks to encircle the wadi.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker had met the SAS down in Oman. He
knew they were operating in the western deserts against Scud-launchers, and
several of his squadron had already been in radio contact with these
strange-sounding English voices from the ground when the SAS men had tagged a
target they could not handle themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At three thousand feet, he could see the four
Britishers looking up curiously. So, half a mile away, were the Iraqis. Walker
pressed his transmit button.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Line astern, take the trucks.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You got it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though he had neither bombs nor rockets left,
tucked in the glove of his right wing, just outside the gaping air intake, was
an M-61-A1 Vulcan 20-min. cannon, six rotating barrels capable of spewing out
its entire magazine of 450 shells with impressive speed. The 20-mm. cannon
shell is the size of a small banana and explodes on impact. For those caught in
a truck or running in the open, they can spoil everything.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker flicked the Aim and Arm switches, and
his Head-Up Display—his HUD—showed him the two armored cars straight through
his screen, plus an aiming cross, whose position had already taken account of
drift and aim-off.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first BRDM took a hundred cannon shells and
blew apart. Raising his nose slightly, he put the swimming cross on the
Plexiglas of the HUD onto the rear of the second vehicle. He saw the gas tank
ignite. Then he was up and over it, climbing and rolling until the brown desert
appeared above his head.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Keeping the roll going, Walker brought the
Eagle back down again. The horizon of blue and brown turned back to its usual
position, with the brown desert at the bottom and the blue sky at the top. Both
BRDMs were flaming, one truck was on its side, the other shredded. Small
figures ran frantically for the cover of the rocks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside the wadi the four SAS men had gotten the
message. They were aboard and rolling down the dry watercourse and away from
the ambush. Just who had spotted them—wandering shepherds, probably—and given
their position away, they would never know, but they knew who had just saved
their backsides.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Eagles lifted away, waggled their wings,
and climbed toward the border and the waiting tanker.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The NCO commanding the SAS patrol was one
Sergeant Peter Stephenson. He raised a hand at the departing fighters and said:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dunno who you are, mate, but I owe you one.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As it happened, Mrs. Maslowski had a Suzuki Jeep as a
runabout, and though she had never driven it in four-wheel mode, she insisted
Terry Martin borrow it. His flight to London was not until five that afternoon,
and he set off early because he did not know how long he would be. He told her
he intended to be back by two at the latest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dr. Maslowski had to return to his office but
gave Martin a map so he would not get lost.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The road to the valley of the Mocho River took
him right back past Livermore, where he found Mines Road running off Tesla.
Mile by mile, the last houses of the suburb of Livermore dropped away, and the
ground rose. He was lucky in the weather. Winter in these parts is never very
cold, but the proximity of the sea gives rise to thick dense clouds and sudden
banks of swirling fog. That January 27<i> </i>the sky was blue and crisp, the
air calm and cold.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Through the windshield he could see the icy tip
of Cedar Mountain far away. Ten miles after the turnoff, he left Mines Road and
turned onto a dirt road, clinging to the side of a precipitous hill.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Down in the valley far below, the Mocho
glittered in the sun as it tumbled between its rocks. The grass on either side
gave way to a mix of sagebrush and she-oak; high above, a pair of kites wheeled
against the blue, and the road ran on, along the edge of Cedar Mountain Ridge
into the wilderness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He passed a single green farmhouse, but Lomax
had told him to go to the end of the road. After another three miles he found
the cabin, rough-hewn with a raw stone chimney and a plume of blue woodsmoke
drifting up to the sky.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He stopped in the yard and got out. From a
barn, a single Jersey cow surveyed him with velvet eyes. Rhythmic sounds came
from the other side of the cabin, so he walked around to the front to find
Daddy Lomax on a bluff looking out over the valley and the river far below.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He must have been seventy-five, but despite
Sandy’s concern, he looked as if he beat up grizzly bears for a hobby. An inch
over six feet, in soiled jeans and a plaid shirt, the old scientist was
splitting logs with the ease of one slicing bread.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Snow-white hair hung to his shoulders, and a
stubble of ivory whiskers rimmed his chin. More white curls spilled from the V
of his shirt, and he seemed to feel no cold, although Terry Martin was glad for
his quilted parka.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Found it then? Heard you coming,” said Lomax,
and split one last log with a single swing. Then he laid down the ax and came
over to his visitor. They shook hands; Lomax gestured to a nearby log and sat
down on one himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dr. Martin, is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Er, yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“From England?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax reached into his top pocket, withdrew a
pouch of tobacco and some rice paper, and began to roll a cigarette.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not politically correct, are you?” Lomax
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax grunted in apparent approval.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Had a politically correct doctor. Always
yellin’ at me to stop smoking.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin noted the past tense.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I suppose you left him?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nope, he left me. Died last week. Fifty-six.
Stress. What brings you up here?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin fumbled in his attaché case.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I ought to apologize at the outset. It’s
probably a waste of your time and mine. I just wondered if you’d glance at
this.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax took the proffered photograph and stared
at it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You really from England?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Helluva long way to come to show me this.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You recognize it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ought to. Spent five years of my life working
there.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin’s mouth dropped open in shock.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’ve actually been there?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Lived there for five years.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“At Tarmiya?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where the hell’s that? This is Oak Ridge.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin swallowed several times.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dr. Lomax. That photograph was taken six days
ago by a U.S. Navy fighter overflying a bombed factory in Iraq.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax glanced up, bright blue eyes under shaggy
white brows, then looked back at the photo.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sonofabitch,” he said at last. “I warned the
bastards. Three years ago. Wrote a paper warning that this was the sort of
technology the Third World would be likely to use.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What happened to it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, they trashed it, I guess.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Who?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You know, the pointy-heads.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Those disks—the Frisbees inside the factory—you
know what they are?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sure. Calutrons. This is a replica of the old
Oak Ridge facility.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Calu-what?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax glanced up again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re not a doctor of science? Not a
physicist?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No. My subject is Arabic studies.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax grunted again, as if not being a
physicist were a hard burden for a man to carry through life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Calutrons. California cyclotrons. Calutrons,
for short.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do they do?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“EMIS. Electromagnetic isotope separation. In
your language, they refine crude uranium-238 to filter out the bomb-grade
uranium-235. You say this place is in Iraq?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. It was bombed by accident a week ago.
This picture was taken the next day. No one seems to know what it means.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax gazed across the valley, sucked on his
butt, and let a plume of azure smoke trickle away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sonofabitch,” he said again. “Mister, I live
up here because I want to. Away from all that smog and traffic—had enough of
that years ago. Don’t have a TV, but I have a radio. This is about that man
Saddam Hussein, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, it is. Would you tell me about calutrons?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man stubbed out his butt and stared
now, not just across the valley but back across many years.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nineteen forty-three. Long time ago, eh?
Nearly fifty years. Before you were born, before most people were born
nowadays. There was a bunch of us then, trying to do the impossible. We were
young, eager, and ingenious, and we didn’t know it was impossible. So we did
it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There was Fermi from Italy, and Pontecorvo;
Fuchs from Germany, Nils Bohr from Denmark, Nunn May from England, and others.
And us Yankees: Urey and Oppie and Ernest. I was very junior. Just
twenty-seven.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Most of the time, we were feeling our way,
doing things that had never been tried, testing out things they said couldn’t
be done. We had a budget that nowadays wouldn’t buy squat, so we worked all day
and all night and took shortcuts. Had to—the deadline was as tight as the
money. And somehow we did it, in three years. We cracked the codes and made the
bomb. Little Boy and Fat Man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then the Air Force dropped them on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, and the world said we shouldn’t have done it after all. Trouble
was, if we hadn’t, somebody else would. Nazi Germany, Stalin’s Russia—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Calutrons ...,” suggested Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yeah. You’ve heard of the Manhattan Project?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, we had many geniuses in Manhattan, two
in particular. Robert J. Oppenheimer and Ernest O. Lawrence. Heard of them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thought they were colleagues, partners, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Wrong. They were rivals. See, we all knew the
key was uranium, the world’s heaviest element. And we knew by 1941 that only
the lighter isotope, 235, would create the chain reaction we needed. The trick
was to separate the point seven percent of the 235 hiding somewhere in the mass
of uranium-238.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When America entered the war, we got a big leg
up. After years of neglect, the brass wanted results yesterday. Same old story.
So we tried every which way to separate those isotopes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oppenheimer went for gas diffusion—reduce the
uranium to a fluid and then a gas, uranium hexafluoride, poisonous and
corrosive, difficult to work. The centrifuge came later, invented by an
Austrian captured by the Russians and put to work at Sukhumi. Before the
centrifuge, gas diffusion was slow and hard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Lawrence went for the other route—electromagnetic
separation by particle acceleration. Know what that means?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Basically, you speed the atoms up to a hell of
a velocity, then use giant magnets to throw them into a curve. Two racing cars
enter a curve at speed, a heavy car and a light car. Which one ends up on the
outside track?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The heavy one,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Right. That’s the principle. The calutrons
depend on giant magnets about twenty feet across. These”—he tapped the Frisbees
in the photograph—“are the magnets. The layout is a replica of my old baby at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If they worked, why were they discontinued?”
asked Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Speed,” said Lomax. “Oppenheimer won out. His
way was faster. The calutrons were extremely slow and very expensive. After
1945, and even more when that Austrian was released by the Russians and came
over here to show us his centrifuge invention, the calutron technology was
abandoned. Declassified. You can get all the details, and the plans, from the
Library of Congress. That’s probably what the Iraqis have done.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two men sat in silence for several minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What you are saying,” suggested Martin, “is
that Iraq decided to use Model-T Ford technology, and because everyone assumed
they’d go for Grand Prix racers, no one noticed.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You got it, son. People forget—the old Model-T
Ford may be old, <i>but it worked</i>. It got you there. It carried you from A
to B. And it hardly ever broke down.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dr. Lomax, the scientists my government and
yours have been consulting know that Iraq has got one cascade of gas diffusion
centrifuges working, and it has been for the past year. Another one is about to
come on stream, but probably is not operating yet. On that basis, they
calculate Iraq cannot possibly have refined enough pure uranium—say,
thirty-five kilograms—to have enough for a bomb.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Quite right,” nodded Lomax. “Need five years
with one cascade, maybe more. Minimum three years with two cascades.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But supposing they’ve been using calutrons in
tandem. If you were head of Iraq’s bomb program, how would you play it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not that way,” said the old physicist, and
began to roll another cigarette. “Did they tell you, back in London, that you
start with yellowcake, which is called zero-percent pure, and you have to
refine it to ninety-three-percent pure to get bomb-grade quality?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin thought of Dr. Hipwell, with his bonfire
of a pipe, in a room under Whitehall saying just that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, they did.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But they didn’t bother to say that purifying
the stuff from zero to twenty takes up most of the time? They didn’t say that
as the stuff gets purer, the process gets faster?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, it does. If I had calutrons and
centrifuges, I wouldn’t use them in tandem. I’d use them in sequence. I’d run
the base uranium through the calutrons to get it from zero to twenty, maybe
twenty-five-percent pure; then use that as the feedstock for the new cascades.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It would cut your refining time in the
cascades by a factor of ten.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin thought it over while Daddy Lomax
puffed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then when would you calculate Iraq could have
those thirty-five kilograms of pure uranium?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Depends when they started with the calutrons.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin thought. After the Israeli jets
destroyed the Iraqi reactor at Osirak, Baghdad operated on two policies:
dispersal and duplication, scattering the laboratories all over the country so
they could never all be bombed again; and using a cover-all-angles technique in
purchasing and experimentation. Osirak had been bombed in 1981.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Say they bought the components on the open
market in 1982 and assembled them by 1983.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax took a stick from the ground near his
feet and began to doodle in the dust.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“These guys got any problem with supplies of
yellowcake, the basic feedstock?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, plenty of feedstock.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Suppose so,” grunted Lomax. “Buy the damn
stuff in K-mart nowadays.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After a while he tapped the photo with his
stick.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This photo shows about twenty calutrons. That
all they had?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe more. We don’t know. Let’s assume that’s
all they had working.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Since 1983, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Basic assumption.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax kept scratching in the dust.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mr. Hussein got any shortage of electric
power?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin thought of the 150-megawatt power
station across the sand From Tarmiya, and the suggestion from the Black Hole
that the cable ran underground into Tarmiya.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, no shortage of power.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We did,” said Lomax. “Calutrons take an
amazing amount of electrical power to function. At Oak Ridge we built the
biggest coal-fired power station ever made. Even then we had to tap into the public
grid. Each time we turned ’em on, there was a brown-out right across Tennessee—soggy
fries and brown light bulbs—we were using so much.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He went on doodling with his stick, making a
calculation, then scratching it out and starting another in the same patch of
dust.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They got a shortage of copper wire?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, they could buy that on the open market
too.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“These giant magnets have to be wrapped in
thousands of miles of copper wire,” said Lomax. “Back in the war, we couldn’t
get any. Needed for war production, every ounce. Know what old Lawrence did?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No idea.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Borrowed all the silver bars in Fort Knox and
melted it into wire. Worked just as well. End of the war, we had to hand it all
back to Fort Knox.” He chuckled. “He was a character.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally he finished and straightened up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If they assembled twenty calutrons in 1983 and
ran the yellowcake through them till ’89 ... and then took thirty-percent-pure
uranium and fed it into the centrifuge cascade for one year, they’d have their
thirty-five keys of ninety-three percent bomb-grade uranium ... November.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Next November,” said Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lomax rose, stretched, reached down, and pulled
his guest to his feet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, son, last November.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Martin drove back down the mountain and glanced at his
watch. Midday. Eight <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> in London.
Paxman would have left his desk and gone home. Martin did not have his home
number.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He could wait twelve hours in San Francisco to
telephone, or he could fly. He decided to fly. Martin landed at Heathrow at
eleven on the morning of January 28 and was with Paxman at twelve-thirty. By
two <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span>, Steve Laing was talking urgently
to Harry Sinclair at the embassy in Grosvenor Square and an hour later the CIA’s
London Station Head was on a direct and very secure line to Deputy Director
(Operations) Bill Stewart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not until the morning of January 30 that
Bill Stewart was able to produce a full report for the DCI, William Webster.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It checks out,” he told the former Kansas
judge. “I’ve had men down at that cabin near Cedar Mountain, and the old man,
Lomax, confirmed it all. We’ve traced his original paper.—it was filed. The records
from Oak Ridge confirm that these disks are calutrons.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How on earth did it happen?” asked the DCI. “How
come we never noticed?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, the idea probably came from Jaafar
Al-Jaafar, the Iraqi boss of their program. Apart from Harwell in England, he also
trained at CERN, outside Geneva. It’s a giant particle accelerator.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Calutrons are particle accelerators. Anyway,
all calutron technology was declassified in 1949. It’s been available on
request ever since.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the calutrons—where were they bought?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In bits, mainly from Austria and France. The
purchases raised no eyebrows because of the antiquated nature of the
technology. The plant was built by Yugoslavs under contract. They said they
wanted plans to build on, so the Iraqis simply gave them the plans of Oak Ridge—that’s
why Tarmiya is a replica.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“When was all this?” asked the DCI.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nineteen eighty-two.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So what this agent, what’s his name—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Jericho,” said Stewart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What he said was not a lie?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Jericho only reported what he claims he heard
Saddam Hussein say at a closed conference. I’m afraid we can no longer exclude
the conclusion that this time the man was actually telling the truth.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And we have kicked Jericho out of play?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He was demanding a million dollars for his
information. We have never paid that amount, and at the time—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“For God’s sake, Bill, it’s cheap at the price!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The DCI rose and went over to the picture
windows. The aspens were bare now, not as they had been in August, and in the
valley the Potomac swept past on its way to the sea.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bill, I want you to get Chip Barber back into
Riyadh. See if there is any way of reestablishing contact with this Jericho.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There is a conduit, sir. A British agent
inside Baghdad. He passes for an Arab. But we suggested that the Century people
pull him out of there.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Just pray they haven’t, Bill. We need Jericho
back. Never mind the funds—I’ll authorize them. Wherever this device is
secreted, we have to find it and bomb it into oblivion before it is too late.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. Er—who is going to tell the generals?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Director sighed. “I’m seeing Colin Powell
and Brent Scowcroft in two hours.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rather you than me, thought Stewart as he left.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942769">Chapter 18</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The two men from Century House arrived in Riyadh before
Chip Barber did from Washington. Steve Laing and Simon Paxman landed before
dawn, having taken the night flight from Heathrow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Julian Gray, the Riyadh Head of Station, met
them in his usual unmarked car and brought them to the villa where he had been
virtually living, with only occasional visits home to see his wife, for five
months. He was puzzled by the sudden reappearance of Paxman from London, let
alone the more senior Steve Laing, to oversee an operation that had effectively
been closed down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the villa, behind closed doors, Laing told
Gray exactly why Jericho had to be traced and brought back into play without
delay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Jesus. So the bastard’s really managed to do
it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have to assume so, even though we have no
proof,” said Laing. “When does Martin have a listening window?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Between eleven-fifteen and eleven forty-five
tonight,” said Gray. “For security, we haven’t sent him anything for five days.
We’ve been expecting him to reappear over the border anytime.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let’s hope he’s still there. If not, we’re in
deep shit. We’ll have to reinfiltrate him, and that could take forever. The
Iraqi deserts are alive with patrols.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How many know about this?” asked Gray.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“As few as possible, and it stays that way,”
replied Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A very tight need-to-know group had been
established between London and Washington, but for the professionals it was
still too big. In Washington there was the President and four members of his
Cabinet, plus the Chairman of the National Security Council and the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Add to that four men at Langley, of whom one, Chip
Barber, was heading for Riyadh. Back in California, the unfortunate Dr. Lomax
had an unwanted house guest in his cabin to ensure he made no contact with the
outside world.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In London, the news had gone to the new Prime
Minister, John Major, the Cabinet Secretary, and two members of the Cabinet; at
Century House, three men knew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In Riyadh there were now three at the SIS
villa, and Barber on his way to join them. Among the military, the information
was confined to four generals—three American and one British.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dr. Terry Martin had developed a diplomatic
bout of flu and was residing comfortably in an SIS safe house in the
countryside, looked after by a motherly housekeeper and three not-so-motherly
minders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From henceforth, all operations against Iraq
that concerned the search for, and destruction of, the device the Allies
assumed to be code-named Qubth-ut-Allah, or the Fist of God, would be
undertaken under the cover of active measures designed to terminate Saddam
Hussein himself, or for some other plausible reason.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two such attempts had in fact already been
made. Two locations had been identified at which the Iraqi President might be
expected to reside, at least temporarily. No one could say precisely when, for
the Rais moved like a will-o’-the-wisp from hiding place to hiding place when
he was not in the bunker in Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Continuous overhead surveillance watched the
two locations. One was a villa out in the countryside forty miles from Baghdad,
the other a big mobile home converted into a war caravan and planning center.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On one occasion the aerial watchers had seen
mobile missile batteries and light armor moving into position around the villa.
A flight of Strike Eagles went in and blew the villa apart. It was a false
alarm—the bird had flown.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the second occasion, two days before the end
of January, the large trailer had been seen to move to a new location. Again an
attack went in; again the target was not at home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On both occasions the fliers took enormous
risks in pressing their attacks, for the Iraqi gunners fought back furiously.
The failure to terminate the Iraqi dictator on both occasions left the Allies
in a quandary. They simply did not know Saddam Hussein’s precise movements. The
fact was, no one knew them, outside of a tiny group of personal bodyguards
drawn from the Amn-al-Khass, commanded by his own son Kusay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In reality, he was moving around most of the
time. Despite the assumption that Saddam was in his bunker deep underground for
the whole of the air war, he was really in residence there for less than half
that time. But his safety was assured by a series of elaborate deceptions and
false trails. On several occasions he was “seen” by his own cheering troops—cynics
said they were cheering because they were the ones not at the front being
pounded by the Buffs. The man the Iraqi troops saw on all such occasions was
one of the doubles who could pass for Saddam among all but his closest
intimates.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At other times, convoys of limousines, up to a
dozen, swept through the city of Baghdad with blackened windows, causing the
citizenry to believe their Rais was inside one of the cars. Not so; these
cavalcades were all decoys. When he moved, he sometimes went in a single
unmarked car.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even among his innermost circle, the security
measures prevailed. Cabinet members alerted for a conference with him would be
given just five minutes to leave their residences, get into their cars, and
follow a motorcycle outrider. Even then, the destination was not the meeting
place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They would be driven to a parked bus with
blackened windows, there to find all the other ministers sitting in the dark.
There was a screen between the ministers and the driver. Even the driver had to
follow an Amn-al-Khass motorcyclist to the eventual destination.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Behind the driver, the ministers, generals, and
advisers sat in darkness like schoolboys on a mystery tour, never knowing where
they were going or, afterward, where they had been.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In most cases these meetings were held in large
and secluded villas, commandeered for the day and vacated before nightfall. A
special detail of the Amn-al-Khass had no other job than to find such a villa
when the Rais wanted a meeting, hold the villa owners incommunicado, and let
them return home when the Rais was long gone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Small wonder the Allies could not find him. But
they tried—until the first week of February. After that, all assassination
attempts were called off, and the military never understood why.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Chip Barber arrived at the British villa in Riyadh just
after midday on the last day of January. After the greetings, the four men sat
and waited out the hours until they could contact Martin, if he was still
there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I suppose we have a deadline on this?” asked
Laing. Barber nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“February twentieth. Stormin’ Norman wants to
march the troops in there on February twentieth.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Paxman whistled. “Twenty days, hell. Is Uncle
Sam going to pick up the tab for this?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yep. The Director has already authorized
Jericho’s one million dollars to go into his account now, today. For the
location of the device, assuming there’s one and only one of them, we’ll pay
the bastard five.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Five million dollars?” expostulated Laing. “Christ,
no one had ever paid anything like that for information!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber shrugged. “Jericho, whoever he is, ranks
as a mercenary. He wants money, nothing else. So let him earn it. There’s a
catch. Arabs haggle, we don’t. Five days after he gets the message, we drop the
ante by half a million a day until he comes up with the precise location. He
has to know that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three Britishers mulled over the sums that
constituted more than all their salaries combined for a lifetime’s work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well,” remarked Laing, “that should put the
breeze up him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The message was composed during the late
afternoon and evening. First, contact would have to be established with Martin,
who would have to confirm with preagreed code words that he was still there and
a free man. Then Riyadh would tell him of the offer to Jericho, in detail, and
press on him the massive urgency now involved.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The men ate sparingly, toying with food, hard
pressed to cope with the tension in the room. At half past ten Simon Paxman
went into the radio shack with the others and spoke the message into the tape
machine. The spoken passage was speeded to two hundred times its real duration
and came out at just under two seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At ten seconds after eleven-fifteen, the senior
radio engineer sent a brief signal—the “are you there” message. Three minutes
later, there was a tiny burst of what sounded like static. The satellite dish
caught it, and when it was slowed down, the five listening men heard the voice
of Mike Martin: “Black Bear to Rocky Mountain, receiving. Over.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was an explosion of relief in the Riyadh
villa, four mature men pumping each other’s backs like football fans whose team
has won the Super Bowl.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Those who have never been there can ill imagine
the sensation of learning that “one of ours” far behind the lines is still,
somehow, alive and free.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Fourteen fucking days he’s sat there,”
marveled Barber. “Why the hell didn’t the bastard pull out when he was told?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Because he’s a stubborn idiot,” muttered
Laing. “Just as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The more dispassionate radio man was sending
another brief interrogatory. He wanted five words to confirm—even though the
oscillograph told him the voice pattern matched that of Martin—that the SAS
major was not speaking under duress. Fourteen days is more than enough to break
a man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His message back to Baghdad was as short as it
could be:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of Nelson and the North, I say again, of
Nelson and the North. Out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Another three minutes elapsed. In Baghdad,
Martin crouched on the floor of his shack at the bottom of First Secretary
Kulikov’s garden, caught the brief blip of sound, spoke his reply, pressed the
speedup button, and transmitted a tenth-of-a-second burst back to the Saudi
capital.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The listeners heard him say “Sing the brilliant
day’s renown.” The radio man grinned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s him, sir. Alive and kicking and free.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Is that a poem?” asked Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The real second line,” said Laing, “is: ‘Sing
the glorious day’s renown.’ If he’d got it right, he’d have been talking with a
gun to his temple. In which case ...” He shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The radio man sent the final message, the real
message, and closed down. Barber reached into his briefcase.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know it may not be strictly according to
local custom, but diplomatic life has certain privileges.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I say,” murmured Gray. “Dom Perignon. Do you
think Langley can afford it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Langley,” said Barber, “has just put five
million greenbacks on the poker table. I guess it can offer you guys a bottle
of fizz.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Jolly decent,” said Paxman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A single week had brought about a transformation in Edith
Hardenberg—a week, that is, and the effects of being in love.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With Karim’s gentle encouragement she had been
to a coiffeur in Grinzing, who had let down her hair and cut and styled it,
chin-length, so that it fell about her face, filling out her narrow features
and giving her a hint of mature glamour.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her lover had selected a range of makeup
preparations with her shy approval; nothing garish, just a hint of eyeliner,
foundation cream, a little powder, and a touch of lipstick at the mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the bank, Wolfgang Gemütlich was privately
aghast, secretly watching her cross the room, taller now in one-inch heels. It
was not even the heels or the hair or the makeup that distressed him, though he
would have flatly banned them all had Frau Gemütlich even mentioned the very
idea. What perturbed him was her air, a sense of self-confidence when she
presented him with his letters for signing or took dictation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He knew, of course, what had happened. One of
those foolish girls downstairs had persuaded her to spend money. That was the
key to it all, spending money. It always, in his experience, led to ruin, and
he feared for the worst.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Her natural shyness had not entirely evaporated,
and in the bank she was as retiring as ever in speech if not quite in manner.
But in Karim’s presence, when they were alone, she constantly amazed herself
with her boldness. For twenty years things physical had been abhorrent to her,
and now she was like a traveler on a voyage of slow and wondering discovery,
half abashed and horrified, half curious and excited. So their loving—at first
wholly one-sided—became more exploratory and mutual. The first time she touched
him “down there,” she thought she would die of shock and mortification, but to
her surprise she had survived.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the evening of the third of February he
brought home to her flat a box wrapped in gift paper with a ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Karim, you mustn’t do things like this. You
are spending too much.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He took her in his arms and stroked her hair.
She had learned to love it when he did that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Look, little kitten, my father is wealthy. He
makes me a generous allowance. Would you prefer me to spend it in nightclubs?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She liked it also when he teased her. Of course,
Karim would never go to one of those terrible places. So she accepted the
perfumes and the toiletries that once, only two weeks ago, she would never have
touched.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can I open it?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s what it’s there for.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At first she did not understand what they were.
The contents of the box seemed to be a froth of silks and lace and colors. When
she understood, because she had seen advertisements in magazines—not the sort
she bought, of course—she turned bright pink.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Karim, I couldn’t. I just couldn’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, you could,” he said, and grinned. “Go on,
kitten. Go into the bedroom and try. Close the door—I won’t look.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She laid the things out on the bed and stared
at them. She, Edith Hardenberg? Never. There were stockings and girdles,
panties and bras, garters and short nighties, in black, pink, scarlet, cream,
and beige. Things in filmy lace or trimmed with it, silky-smooth fabrics over
which the fingertips ran as over ice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was an hour alone in that room before she
opened the door in a bathrobe. Karim put down his coffee cup, rose, and walked
over. He stared down at her with a kind smile and began to undo the sash that
held the robe together. She blushed red again and could not meet his gaze. She
looked away. He let the robe fall open.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, kitten,” he said softly, “you are
sensational.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She did not know what to say, so she just put
her arms around his neck, no longer frightened or horrified when her thigh
touched the hardness in his jeans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they had made love, she rose and went to
the bathroom. On her return she stood and looked down at him. There was no part
of him that she did not love. She sat on the edge of the bed and ran a
forefinger down the faint scar along one side of his chin, the one he said he
had sustained when falling through a greenhouse in his father’s orchard outside
Amman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He opened his eyes, smiled, and reached up for
her face; she gripped his hand and nuzzled the fingers, stroking the signet
ring on the smallest finger, the ring with the pale pink opal that his mother
had given him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What shall we do tonight?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let’s go out,” he said. “Sirk’s at the
Bristol.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You like steak too much.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He reached behind her and held her small
buttocks under the filmy gauze.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s the steak I like.” He grinned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Stop it—you’re terrible, Karim!” she said. “I
must dress.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She pulled away and caught sight of herself in
the mirror. How could she have changed so much? she thought. How could she ever
have brought herself to wear lingerie? Then she realized why. For Karim, her
Karim, whom she loved and who loved her, she would do anything. Love might have
come late in her life, but it had come with the force of a mountain torrent.</p>

Hussein</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>CLASSIFICATION: EYES ONLY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>It will certainly not
have escaped your attention that since the inception of hostilities between the
Coalition Air Forces flying out of Saudi Arabia and neighboring states, and the
Republic of Iraq, at least two and possibly more attempts have been made to
achieve the demise of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>All such attempts have
been by aerial bombardment and exclusively by the United States. This group
therefore considers it urgent to spell out the likely consequences of a
successful attempt to assassinate Mr. Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>The ideal outcome
would, of course, be for any successor regime to the present Ba’ath Party
dictatorship, set up under the auspices of the victorious Coalition forces, to
take the form of a humane and democratic government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>We believe such a hope
to be illusory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>In the first place,
Iraq is not nor ever was a united country. It is barely a generation away from
being a patchwork quilt of rival, often warring tribes. It contains in almost
equal parts two potentially hostile sects of Islam, the Sunni and Shi’a faiths,
plus three Christian minorities. To these one should add the Kurdish nation in
the north, vigorously pursuing its search for separate independence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>In the second place,
there has never been a shred of democratic experience in Iraq, which has passed
from Turkish to Hashemite to Ba’ath Party rule without the benefit of an
intervening interlude of democracy as we understand it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>In the event,
therefore, of the sudden end of the present dictatorship by assassination,
there are only two realistic scenarios.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>The first would be an
attempt to impose from outside a consensus government embracing all the
principal factions along the lines of a broadly based coalition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>In the view of this
group, such a structure would survive in power for an extremely limited period.
Traditional and age-old rivalries would need little time literally to pull it
apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>The Kurds would
certainly use the opportunity, so long denied, to opt for secession and the
establishment of their own republic in the north. A weak central government in
Baghdad based upon agreement by consensus would be impotent to prevent such a
move.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>The Turkish reaction
would be predictable and furious, since Turkey’s own Kurdish minority along the
border areas would lose no time in joining their fellow Kurds across the border
in a much invigorated resistance to Turkish rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>To the southeast, the
Shi’a majority around Basra and the Shatt-al-Arab would certainly find good
reason to make overtures to Teheran. Iran would be sorely tempted to avenge the
slaughter of its young people in the recent Iran-Iraq war by entertaining those
overtures in the hope of annexing southeastern Iraq in the face of the
helplessness of Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>The pro-Western Gulf
States and Saudi Arabia would be precipitated into something approaching panic
at the thought of an Iran reaching to the very border of Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>Farther north, the
Arabs of Iranian Arabistan would find common cause with their fellow Arabs
across the border in Iraq, a move that would be vigorously repressed by the
Ayatollahs in Teheran.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>In the rump of Iraq we
would almost certainly see an outbreak of intertribal fighting to settle old
scores and establish supremacy over what was left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>We have all observed
with distress the civil war now raging between Serbs and Croats in the former
Yugoslavia. So far, this fighting has not yet spread to Bosnia, where a third
component force in the form of the Bosnian Moslems awaits. When the fighting
enters Bosnia, as one day it will, the slaughter will be even more appalling
and even more intractable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>Nonetheless, this
group believes that the misery of Yugoslavia will pale into insignificance
compared with the scenario now painted for an Iraq in full disintegration. In
such a case, one can look forward to a major civil war in the rump of the Iraqi
heartland, four border wars, and the complete destabilization of the Gulf. The
refugee problem alone would amount to millions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>The only other viable
scenario is for Saddam Hussein to be succeeded by another general or senior
member of the Ba’ath hierarchy. But as all those in the present hierarchy are
as bloodstained as their leader, it is hard to see what benefits would accrue
from the replacement of one monster by another, possibly even a cleverer
despot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>The ideal, though
admittedly not perfect, solution must therefore be the retention of the status
quo in Iraq, except that all weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed and
the conventional weapons power be so degraded as not to present a threat to any
neighboring state for a minimum of a decade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>It could well be
argued that the continuing human rights abuses of the present Iraqi regime, if
it is allowed to survive, will prove most distressing. This is beyond any
doubt. Yet the West has been required to witness terrible scenes in China,
Russia, Vietnam, Tibet, East Timor, Cambodia, and many other parts of the
world. It is simply not possible for the United States to impose humanity on a
worldwide scale unless it is prepared to enter into permanent global war.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>The least catastrophic
outcome of the present war in the Gulf and the eventual invasion of Iraq is
therefore the survival in power of Saddam Hussein as sole master of a unified
Iraq, albeit militarily emasculated as regards foreign aggression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'>For all the stated
reasons, this group urges an end to all the efforts to assassinate Saddam
Hussein, or to march to Baghdad and occupy Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin found the chalk mark on February 7
and retrieved the slim glassine envelope from the dead-letter box that same
evening. Shortly after midnight, he set up his satellite dish pointing out of
the doorway of his shack and read the spidery Arabic script on the single page
of onionskin paper straight into the tape machine. After the Arabic, he added
his own English translation and sent the message at 0016 <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span>, one minute into his window.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the burst came through and the satellite
caught it in Riyadh, the radio man on duty shouted:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s here. Black Bear’s coming through!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four sleepy men in the adjoining room ran
in. The big tape machine against the wall slowed down and decrypted the
message. When the technician punched the playback button, the room was filled
with the sound of Martin speaking Arabic. Paxman, whose Arabic was best,
listened to the halfway point and hissed:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s found it. Jericho says he’s found it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Quiet, Simon.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Arabic stopped, and the English text began.
When the voice stopped and signed off, Barber smacked one bunched fist into the
palm of his other hand in excitement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Boy, he’s done it. Guys, can you get me a
transcript of that—like, <i>now</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The technician ran the tape back, put on
earphones, turned to his word processor, and began to type.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber went to a telephone in the living room
and called the underground headquarters of CENTAF. There was only one man he
needed to talk to.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Chuck Horner apparently needed very
little sleep. No one either in the Coalition Command offices beneath the Saudi
Defense Ministry or the CENTAF headquarters beneath the Saudi Air Force
building on Old Airport Road was getting much sleep during those weeks, but
General Horner seemed to get less than most.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Perhaps when his beloved aircrew was aloft and
flying deep into enemy territory, he did not feel able to sleep. As the flying
was going on twenty-four hours per day, that left little sleeping time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had a habit of prowling the offices of the
CENTAF complex in the middle of the night, ambling from the analysts of the
Black Hole along to the Tactical Air Control Center. If a telephone rang
unattended and he was near it, he would answer it. Several bemused Air Force
officers out in the desert, calling up for a clarification or with a query and
expecting a duty major to come on the line, found themselves speaking to the
boss himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a very democratic habit, but it
occasionally brought surprises. On one occasion a squadron commander, who will
have to remain nameless, called to complain that his pilots were nightly
running a gauntlet of triple-A fire on their way to their targets. Could not
the Iraqi gunners be squashed by a visit from the heavy bombers, the Buffs?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Horner told the lieutenant colonel that
this was not possible—the Buffs were fully tasked. The squadron commander out
in the desert protested, but the answer was still the same. Well, said the
lieutenant colonel, in that case you can suck me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Very few officers can tell a full general to do
that and get away with it. It says much for Chuck Horner’s approach to his
flying crews that two weeks later the feisty squadron commander got his
promotion to full colonel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That was where Chip Barber found Horner that
night, just before one o’clock, and they met in the general’s private office
inside the underground complex forty minutes later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The general read the transcription of the
English language text from Riyadh gloomily. Barber had used the word processor
to annotate certain parts—it no longer looked like a radio message.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This another of your deductions from
interviewing businessmen in Europe?” he asked mordantly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We believe the information to be accurate,
General.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Horner grunted. Like most combat men, he had
little time for the covert world—the people referred to as spooks. It was ever
thus. The reason is simple. Combat is dedicated to the pursuit of optimism—cautious
optimism perhaps, but nevertheless optimism—or no one would ever take part in
it. The covert world is dedicated to the presumption of pessimism. The two
philosophies have little in common, and even at this stage of the war the U.S.
Air Force was becoming increasingly irritated by the CIA’s repeated suggestions
that it was destroying fewer targets than it claimed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And is this supposed target associated with
what I think it is?” asked the general.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We just believe it to be very important, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, first thing, Mr. Barber, we’re going to
have a damn good look at it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This time it was a TR-1 out of Taif that did the honors.
An upgraded version of the old U-2, the TR-1 was being used as a multitask
information gatherer, able to overfly Iraq out of sight and sound, using its
technology to probe deep into the defenses with radar imaging and listening
equipment. But it still had its cameras and was occasionally used not for the
broad picture but for a single intimate mission. The task of photographing a
location known only as Al Qubai was about as intimate as one can get.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a second reason for the TR-1: It can
transmit its pictures in real time. No waiting for the mission to come back,
download the TARPS, develop the film, and rush it across to Riyadh. As the TR-1
cruised over the designated patch of desert west of Baghdad and south of the
Al-Muhammadi air base, the images it saw came straight to a television screen
in the basement of the Saudi Air Force headquarters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were five men in the room, including the
technician who operated the console and who could, at a word from the other
four, order the computer to freeze-frame and run off a photographic print for study.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Chip Barber and Steve Laing were there,
tolerated in their civilian dress in this mecca of military prowess; the other
two were Colonel Beatty of the USAF and Squadron Leader Joe Peck of” the RAF,
both experts in target analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The reason for using <i>Al Qubai </i>was simply
that this was the nearest village to the target; as it was too small a
settlement to show up on their maps, it was the accompanying grid reference and
description that mattered to the analysts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The TR-1 found it a few miles from the grid
reference sent by Jericho, but there could be no question that the description
was exact, and there were no other locations remotely near that fit the
description.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four men watched the target swim into
vision, freeze on the best frame, and hold. The modem punched out a print for
study.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s under there?” breathed Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Must be,” said Colonel Beatty. “There’s
nothing else like it for miles around.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Cunning buggers,” said Peck.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Al Qubai was in fact the nuclear engineering
plant for Dr. Jaafar Al-Jaafar’s entire Iraqi nuclear program.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A British nuclear engineer once remarked that
his craft was “ten percent genius and ninety percent plumbing.” There is rather
more to it than that. The engineering plant is where craftsmen take the product
of the physicists, the calculations of the mathematicians and the computers,
and the results of the chemists and assemble the final product. It is the
nuclear engineers who actually make the device into a deliverable piece of
metal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Iraq had buried its Al Qubai plant completely
beneath the desert, eighty feet down, and that was just the level of the roof.
Beneath the roof, three stories of workshops ran farther downward. What caused
Squadron Leader Peck’s “cunning buggers” remark was the skill with which it had
been disguised.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It is not all that difficult to build an entire
factory underground, but disguising it presents major problems. Once it is
constructed in its giant crater, sand may be bulldozed back against the
ferroconcrete walls and over the roof until the building is concealed. Sinks
beneath the lowest floor may cope with drainage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the factory will need air conditioning;
that requires a fresh-air intake and a foul-air outlet—both pipes jutting out
of the desert floor. It will also need masses of electric power, implying a
powerful diesel generator. That too needs an air intake and exhaust outlet—two
more pipes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There must be a down-ramp or a passenger
elevator and a cargo hoist for deliveries and departures of personnel and
materials—another above-surface structure. Delivery trucks cannot roll on soft
sand; they need a hard road, a spur of tarmac running from the nearest main
road.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There will be heat emissions, concealable
during the day when the outside air is hot, but not during the chill nights.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>How therefore to disguise from aerial
surveillance an area of virgin desert entertaining a tarmac road that seems to
run to nowhere, four major pipes, an elevator shaft, the constant arrival and
departure of trucks, and frequent heat emissions?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was Colonel Osman Badri, the young genius of
Iraq’s Army Engineering Corps, who had cracked it; and his solution fooled the
Allies with all their spy planes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the air, Al Qubai was a forty-five-acre
automobile junkyard. Though the watchers in Riyadh, even with their best magnifiers,
could not see it, four of the heaps of rusting car wrecks were welded frames—solid
domes of twisted metal—beneath which pipes sucked in fresh air or filtered out
the foul gases through the broken bodies of cars and vans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The main shed, the cutting shop, with its steel
tanks of oxygen and acetylene ostentatiously parked outside, hid the entry to
the elevator shafts. The naturalness of welding in such a place would justify a
heat source.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The reason for the single-track tarred road was
obvious—trucks needed to arrive with car wrecks and leave with scrap steel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The whole system had actually been seen early
on by AWACS, which registered a great mass of metal in the middle of the
desert. Was it a tank division? An ammunition dump? An early fly-over had
established it was just a car junkyard, and interest had been abandoned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What the four men in Riyadh could also not see
was that four other minimountains of rusted car bodies were also solidly welded
frames, internally shaped like domes, but with hydraulic jacks beneath them.
Two of them housed powerful antiaircraft batteries, multibarreled ZSU-23-4
Russian cannon; the other two concealed SAMs, models 6,8, and 9, not
radar-guided but the smaller heat-seeking type—a radar dish would have given
the game away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So it’s under there,” breathed Beatty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even as they watched, a long truck loaded with
old car bodies entered the picture. It seemed to move in little jerks, because
the TR-1, flying eighty thousand feet above Al Qubai, was running off still
frames at the rate of several a second. Fascinated, the two intelligence
officers watched until the truck reversed into the welding shed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Betcha the food, water, and supplies are under
the car bodies,” said Beatty. He sat back. “Trouble is, we’ll never get at the
damn factory. Not even the Buffs can bomb that deep.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We could close them down,” said Peck. “Crush
the lift shaft, seal ’em in. Then if they try any rescue work to unblock, we
shoot them up again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sounds good,” agreed Beatty. “How many days
till the land invasion?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Twelve,” said Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We can do it,” said Beatty. “High-level,
laser-guided, a mass of planes, a gorilla.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing shot Barber a warning glance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We’d prefer something a little more discreet,”
said Barber. “A two-ship raid, low-level, eyeball confirmation of destruction.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was silence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You guys trying to tell us something?” asked
Beatty. “Like, Baghdad is not supposed to know we’re interested?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Could you please do it that way?” urged Laing.
“There don’t seem to be any defenses. The key here is disguise.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beatty sighed. Fucking spooks, he thought. They’re
trying to protect someone. Well, none of my business.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you think, Joe?” he asked the squadron
leader.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Tornados could do it,” said Joe Peck, “with
Buccaneers target-marking for them. Six one-thousand-pound bombs right through
the door of the shed. I’ll bet that tin shed is ferroconcrete inside. Should
contain the blast nicely.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beatty nodded. “Okay, you guys have it. I’ll
clear it with General Horner. Who do you want to use, Joe?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Six-oh-eight Squadron, at Maharraq. I know the
CO, Phil Curzon. Shall I get him over here?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Wing Commander Philip Curzon commanded twelve
of the Royal Air Force’s Panavia Tornados of the 608th Squadron, on the island
of Bahrain, where they had arrived two months earlier from their base at
Laarbruck, Germany. Just after noon that day, February 8, he received an order
that brooked no denial: to report immediately to the CENTAF headquarters in
Riyadh. So great was the urgency that by the time he had acknowledged the
message, his orderly officer reported that a Beach King Air from Shakey’s Pizza
on the other side of the island had landed and was taxiing in to pick him up.
When he boarded the Beach King Air after throwing on a uniform jacket and cap,
he discovered that the twin-engined executive plane was assigned to General
Horner himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What the hell is going on?” the wing commander
asked himself, and with justification.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At Riyadh military air base a USAF staff car
was waiting to carry him the mile down Old Airport Road to the Black Hole.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four men who had been in conference to see
the TR-1’s mission pictures at ten that morning were still there. Only the
technician was missing. They needed no more pictures. The ones they had were
spread all over the table. Squadron Leader Peck made the introductions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Steve Laing explained what was needed, and
Curzon examined the photos.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Philip Curzon was no fool, or he would not have
been commanding a squadron of Her Majesty’s very expensive fighter-bombers. In
the early low-level missions with JP-233 bombs against Iraqi airfields, he had
lost two aircraft and four good men; two he knew were dead. The other two had
just been paraded, battered and dazed, on Iraqi TV, another of Saddam’s PR
masterpieces.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why not put this target on the Air Tasking
Order, like all the others?” he asked quietly. “Why the hurry?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let me be perfectly straight with you,” said
Laing. “We now believe this target to house Saddam’s principal and perhaps only
store of a particularly vicious poison gas shell. There is evidence that the
first stocks are about to be moved to the front. Hence the urgency.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beatty and Peck perked up. This was the first
explanation they had received to explain the spooks’ interest in the factory
beneath the junkyard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But two attack planes?” Curzon persisted. “Just
two? That makes it a very low-priority mission. What am I supposed to tell my
aircrew? I’m not going to lie to them, gentlemen. Please get that quite
straight.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s no need, and I wouldn’t tolerate that
either,” said Laing. “Just tell them the truth. That aerial surveillance has
indicated movement of trucks to and from the site. The analysts believe them to
be military trucks, and they have jumped to the conclusion this apparent
scrapyard hides an ammunition dump—principally, inside that big central shed.
So that’s the target. As for a low-level mission, you can see there are no
missiles, no triple-A.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And that’s the truth?” asked the wing
commander.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I swear it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then why, gentlemen, the clear intention that
if any of my crews are shot down and interrogated, Baghdad should not learn
where the information really came from? You don’t believe the military truck
story any more than I do.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty and Squadron Leader Peck sat
back. This man really was squeezing the spooks hard where it hurt most. Good
for him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Tell him, Chip,” said Laing in resignation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay, Wing Commander, I’ll level with you. But
this is for your ears only. The rest is absolutely true. We have a defector. In
the States. Came over before the war as a graduate student. Now he’s fallen for
an American girl and wants to stay. During the interviews with the immigration
people, something came up. A smart interviewer passed him over to us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The CIA?” asked Curzon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay, yes, the CIA. We did a deal with the
guy. He gets the green card, he helps us. When he was in Iraq, in Army
Engineers, he worked on a few secret projects. Now he’s spilling all. So now
you know. But it’s top classification. It doesn’t alter the mission, and it isn’t
lying for you not to tell the aircrew that—which, incidentally, you may not do.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“One last question,” said Curzon. “If the man
is safe in the States, why the need to fool Baghdad anymore?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There are other targets he’s spilling for us.
It takes time, but we may get twenty fresh targets out of him. We alert Baghdad
that he’s singing like a canary, they move the goodies somewhere else by night.
They can add two and two as well, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Philip Curzon rose and gathered the photos.
Each had its exact grid reference on the map stamped on one side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right. Dawn tomorrow. That shed will cease
to exist.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then he left. On the flight back he mulled over
the mission. Something inside him said it stank like an old cod. But the
explanations were perfectly feasible, and he had his orders. He would not lie,
but he had been forbidden to disclose everything. The good part was, the target
was based on deception, not protection. His men should get in and out
unscathed. He already knew who would lead the attack.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Squadron Leader Lofty Williamson was happily
sprawled in a chair in the evening sun when the call came. He was reading the
latest edition of <i>World Air Power Journal</i>, the combat pilots’ bible, and
was annoyed to be torn away from a superbly authoritative article on one of the
Iraqi fighters he might run into.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The squadron commander was in his office,
photos spread out before him. For an hour he briefed his senior flight
commander on what was wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’ll have two Bucks to mark target for you,
so you should be able to loft and get the hell out of there before the ungodly
know what’s hit ’em.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Williamson found his navigator, the rear-seat
man the Americans call the wizzo, who nowadays does a lot more than navigate,
being in charge of air electronics and weapons systems. Flight Lieutenant Sid
Blair was reputed to be able to find a tin can in the Sahara if it needed
bombing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Between them, with the aid of the Operations
people, they mapped out the mission. The exact location of the junkyard was
found, from its grid reference, on their air maps.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pilot made plain that he wanted to attack
from the east at the very moment of the rising of the sun, so that any Iraqi
gunners would have the light in their eyes while he, Williamson, would see the
target with complete clarity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Blair insisted he wanted a “stone bonker,” some
unmistakable landmark along the run-in track by which he could make tiny
last-minute adjustments on his course-to-steer. They found one twelve miles
back from the target in an easterly direction—a radio mast exactly one mile
from the run-in track.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Going in at dawn would give them the vital Time
on Target, or TOT, that they needed. The reason the TOT must be followed to the
second is that precision makes the difference between success and failure. If
the first pilot is late even by one second, the follow-up pilot could run right
into the explosion of his colleague’s bombs; worse, the first pilot will have a
Tornado coming up on his rear at nearly ten miles a minute—not a pretty sight.
Finally, if the first pilot is too early or the second pilot too late, the
gunners will have time to wake up, man their guns, and aim them. So the second
fliers go in just as the shrapnel of the first explosions subside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Williamson brought in his wingman and the
second navigator, two young flight lieutenants, Peter Johns and Nicky Tyne. The
precise moment the sun should rise over the low hills to the east of the target
was agreed at 0708 hours, and the attack heading at 270 degrees due west.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two Buccaneers from the 12th Squadron, also
based at Maharraq, had been assigned. Williamson would liaise with their pilots
in the morning. The armorers had been instructed to fit three
one-thousand-pound bombs equipped with PAVEWAY laser-guidance noses to each
Tornado. At eight that night, the four aircrew ate and went to bed, with a
morning call set for three <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was still pitch-black when an aircraftman in
a truck came to the 608th Squadron’s sleeping quarters to take the four crewmen
to the flight hut.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the Americans at Al Kharz were roughing it
under canvas, those based on Bahrain enjoyed the comfort of civilized living.
Some were bunking two to a room at the Sheraton Hotel. Others were in
brick-built bachelor quarters nearer the air base. The food was excellent,
drink was available, and the worst loneliness of the combat life was assuaged
by the presence of three hundred female trainee flight attendants at the nearby
training school of Gulf Air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Buccaneers had been brought out to the Gulf
only a week earlier, having first been told they were not wanted. Since then,
they had more than proved their worth. Essentially submarine-busters, the Bucks
were more accustomed to skimming the waters of the North Sea looking for Soviet
submersibles, but they did not mind the desert either.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Their speciality was low flying, and although
they were thirty-year-old veterans, they had been known, in interservice war
games with the USAF at the Navy Fighter School in Miramar, California, to evade
the much faster American fighters simply by “eating dirt”—flying so low as to
become impossible to follow through the buttes and mesas of the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The inter-air-force rivalry will have it that
the Americans do not like low flying and under five hundred feet tend to lower
their undercarriages, whereas the Royal Air Force love it and above one hundred
feet complain of altitude sickness. In fact, both can fly low or high, but the
Bucks, not supersonic but amazingly maneuverable, figure they can go lower than
anyone and survive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The reason for their appearance in the Gulf was
the original losses sustained by the Tornados on their first ultra-low-level
missions. Working alone, the Tornados had to launch their bombs and then follow
them all the way to the target, right into the heart of the triple-A. But when
they and the Buccaneers worked together, the Tornados’ bombs carried the
laser-seeking PAVEWAY nose cone, while the Bucks bore the laser transmitter,
called PAVESPIKE. Riding above and behind a Tornado, a Buck could “mark” the
target, letting the Tornado release the bomb and then get the hell out without
delay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Moreover, the Buck’s PAVESPIKE was mounted in a
gyroscopically stabilized gimbal in its belly, so that it too could twist and
weave, while keeping the laser beam right on the target until the bomb arrived
and hit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the flight hut, Williamson and the two Buck
pilots agreed to set their IP—Initial Point, the start of the bomb run—at
twelve miles east of the target shed. Then they went to change into flying
gear. As usual, they had arrived in civilian clothes; the policy on Bahrain was
that too much military out on the streets might alarm the locals.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they were all changed, Williamson as
mission commander completed the briefing. It was still two hours to takeoff.
The thirty-second “scramble” of Second World War pilots was a long way gone.
There was time for coffee and the next stage of preparations. Each man picked
up his handgun, a small Walther PPK that they all loathed, figuring that if
attacked in the desert they might as well throw it at an Iraqi’s head and hope
to knock him out that way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They also drew their £1000 in five gold
sovereigns and the “goolie chit.” This remarkable document was first introduced
to the Americans in the Gulf War, but the British, who have been flying combat
in those parts since the 1920s, understood them well. A goolie chit is a letter
in Arabic and six kinds of Bedouin dialect. It says in effect, “Dear Mr. Bedou,
the presenter of this letter is a British officer. If you return him to the
nearest British patrol, complete with his testicles and preferably where they
ought to be and not in his mouth, you will be rewarded with £5000 in gold.”
Sometimes it works.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The flying uniforms had reflective shoulder
patches that could possibly be detected by Allied seekers if a pilot came down
in the desert; but no wings above the left breast pocket, just a Velcroed Union
Jack patch.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After coffee came sterilization—not as bad as
it sounds. All rings, cigarettes, lighters, letters, and family photos were
removed, anything that might give an interrogator a lever on the personality of
his prisoner. The strip search was carried out by a stunning WAAF named Pamela
Smith—the aircrew figured this was the best part of the mission, and younger
pilots dropped their valuables into the most surprising places to see if Pamela
could find them. Fortunately, she had once been a nurse and accepted this
nonsense with calm good humor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One hour to takeoff. Some men ate, some couldn’t,
some cat-napped, some drank coffee and hoped they would not have to pee halfway
through the mission, and some threw up. The bus took the eight men to their
aircraft, already buzzing with riggers, fitters, and armorers. Each pilot
walked around his ship, checking through the pretakeoff ritual. Finally they
climbed aboard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first task was to get settled, fully
strapped in, and linked to the Have-quick radio so that they could talk. Then
the APU—the auxiliary power unit that set all the instruments dancing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the rear the inertial navigation platform
came alive, giving Sid Blair the chance to punch in his planned courses and
turns. Williamson started his right engine, which began to howl softly, then
the left.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Close canopy, taxi to number one, the holding
point. Clearance from the tower, taxi to takeoff point. Williamson glanced to
his right. Peter Johns’s Tornado was beside him and a bit back, and beyond him
the two Buccaneers. He raised a hand. Three white-gloved hands rose in return.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Foot brakes on, run up to maximum “dry” power.
The Tornado was trembling gently. Through the throttle gate into afterburn, now
she was shuddering against the brakes. A final thumbs-up and three
acknowledgments. Brakes off, the surge, the roll, the tarmac flashing by faster
and faster, and then they were up, four in formation, banking over the dark
sea, the lights of Manama dropping behind, setting course for the rendezvous
with the tanker waiting for them somewhere over the Saudi border with Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Williamson brought the power setting out of
afterburn and settled into a climb at 300 knots to twenty thousand feet. With
radar, they found the tanker in the darkness, closed behind her, and inserted
their fuel nozzles into the trailing drogues. Once topped up, all four turned
and dropped away down to the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Williamson leveled his detail at two hundred
feet, setting a maximum cruise at 480 knots, and thus they sped into Iraq. He
was flying with the aid of TIALD, the Thermal Imaging and Laser Designator,
which was the British equivalent of the LANTIRN system. Low over the black
desert, the pilots could see everything ahead of them, the rocks, the cliffs,
the outcrops, the hills, as if they glowed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just before the sun rose, they turned at the IP
onto the bombing run. Sid Blair saw the radio mast and told his pilot to adjust
course by one degree.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Williamson flicked his bomb-release catches to
slave mode and glanced at his Head-Up Display, which was running off the miles
and seconds to release point. He was down to a hundred feet, over flat ground
and holding steady. Somewhere behind him, his wingman was doing the same. Time
on Target was exact. He was easing the throttle in and out of afterburn to
maintain an attack speed of 540 knots.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sun cleared the hills, the first beams
sliced across the plain, and there it was at six miles. He could see the metal
glinting, the mounds of junked cars, and the great gray shed in the center, the
double doors pointing toward him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Bucks were a hundred feet above and a mile
back. The talk-through from the Bucks, which had begun at the IP, continued in
his ears. Six miles and closing, five miles, some movement in the target area,
four miles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I am marking,” said the first Buck navigator.
The laser beam from the Buck was right on the door of the shed. At three miles,
Williamson began his “loft,” easing the nose up, blanking out his vision of the
target. No matter, the technology would do the rest. At three hundred feet his
HUD told him to release. He flicked the bomb switch, and all three
one-thousand-pound bombs flew away from his underside. Because he was lofting,
the bombs rose slightly with him before gravity took over and they began a
graceful downward parabola toward the shed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With his plane one and a half tons lighter, he
rose fast to a thousand feet, then threw on 135 degrees of bank and kept
pulling at the control column. The Tornado was diving and turning, back to the
earth and back the way it had come. His Buck flashed over him, then pulled away
in its turn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because he had a TV camera in the belly of his
aircraft, the Buccaneer navigator could see the bombs’ impact right on the
doors of the shed. The entire area in front of the shed dissolved in a sheet of
flame and smoke, while a pillar of dust rose from the place where the shed had
been. As it began to settle. Peter Johns in the second Tornado was coming in,
thirty seconds behind his leader.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Buck navigator saw more than that. The
movements he had seen earlier codified into a pattern. Guns were visible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They’ve got triple-A!” he shouted. The second
Tornado was lofting. The second Buccaneer could see it all. The shed, blown to
pieces under the impact of the first three bombs, revealed an inner structure
twisted and bent. But there were antiaircraft cannon blazing among the mounds
of wrecked cars.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bombs gone!” yelled Johns, and hauled his
Tornado into a maximum-G turn. His own Buccaneer was also pulling away from the
target, but its belly PAVESPIKE kept the beam on the remains of the shed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Impact!” screamed the Buck’s navigator.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a flicker of fire among the car
wrecks. Two shoulder-borne SAMs hared off after the Tornado.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Williamson had leveled from his turning dive,
back to one hundred feet above the desert but heading the other way, toward the
now-risen sun. He heard Peter Johns’s voice shout, “We’re hit!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Behind him, Sid Blair was silent. Swearing in
his anger, Williamson pulled the Tornado around again, thinking there might be
a chance of holding off the Iraqi gunners with his cannon. He was too late.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He heard one of the Bucks say, “They’ve got
missiles down there,” and then he saw Johns’s Tornado, climbing, streaming
smoke from a blazing engine, heard the twenty-five-year-old say quite clearly, “Going
down ... ejecting.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was nothing more any of them could do. In
earlier missions the Bucks used to accompany the Tornados home. By this date,
it had been agreed the Bucks could go home on their own. In silence the two
target markers did what they did best: They got their bellies right on the
desert in the morning sun and kept them there all the way home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lofty Williamson was in a blind rage, convinced
he had been lied to. He had not; no one knew about the triple-A and the
missiles hidden at Al Qubai.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>High above, a TR-1 sent real-time pictures of
the destruction back to Riyadh. An E-3 Sentry had heard all the in-air talk and
told Riyadh they had lost a Tornado crew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lofty Williamson came home alone, to debrief
and vent his anger on the target selectors in Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the CENTAF headquarters on Old Airport Road,
the delight of Steve Laing and Chip Barber that the Fist of God had been buried
in the womb where it had been created was marred by the loss of the two young
men.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942770">Chapter 19</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Brigadier Hassan Rahmani sat in his private office in the
Mukhabarat building in Mansour and contemplated the events of the previous
twenty-four hours with near despair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That the principal military and war-production
centers of his country were being systematically torn apart by bombs and
rockets did not worry him. These developments, predicted by him weeks before,
simply brought closer the pending American invasion and the fall from office of
the man from Tikrit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was something he had planned for, longed
for, and confidently expected, unaware on that midday of February 1991 that it
was not going to happen. Rahmani was a highly intelligent man, but he did not
have a crystal ball.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What concerned him that morning was his own
survival, the odds that he would live to see the day of Saddam Hussein’s fall.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bombing at dawn of the previous day of the
nuclear engineering plant at Al Qubai, so cunningly disguised that no one had
ever envisaged its discovery, had shaken the power elite of Baghdad to its
roots.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within minutes of the departure of the two
British bombers, the surviving gunners had been in contact with Baghdad to
report the attack. On hearing of the event, Dr. Jaafar Al-Jaafar had personally
leaped into his car and driven to the spot to check on his underground staff.
He was beside himself with rage and by noon had complained bitterly to Hussein
Kamil, under whose Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization the
entire nuclear program reposed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Here was a program, the diminutive scientist
had reportedly screamed at Saddam’s son-in-law, that out of a total arms
expenditure of $50 billion in a decade had alone consumed $8 billion, and at
the very moment of its triumph it was being destroyed. Could the state offer no
protection to his people?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iraqi physicist might have stood a whisker
over five feet and been built like a mosquito, but in terms of influence he
packed quite a punch, and the word was that he had gone on and on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A chastened Hussein Kamil had reported to his
father-in-law, who had also been consumed by a transport of rage. When that
happened, all Baghdad trembled for its life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The scientists underground had not only
survived but escaped, for the factory included a narrow tunnel leading half a
mile under the desert and terminating in a circular shaft with handrails in the
wall. The personnel had emerged this way, but it would be impossible to move
heavy machinery through the same tunnel and shaft.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The main elevator and cargo hoist was a twisted
wreck from the surface down to a depth of twenty feet. Restoring it would be a
major engineering feat occupying weeks—weeks that Hassan Rahmani suspected Iraq
did not have.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Had that been the end of the matter, he would
simply have been relieved, for he had been a deeply worried man since that
conference at the palace before the air war began, when Saddam had revealed the
existence of “his” device.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What now worried Rahmani was the crazed rage of
his head of state. Deputy President Izzat Ibrahim had called him shortly after
noon of the previous day, and the head of Counterintelligence had never known
Saddam’s closest confidant to be in such a state.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ibrahim had told him the Rais was beside
himself with anger, and when that happened, blood usually spilled. Only this
could appease the rage of the man from Tikrit. The Deputy President had made
plain that it was expected that he—Rahmani—would produce results, and fast. “What
results, precisely, did you have in mind?” he had asked Ibrahim. “Find out,”
Ibrahim had yelled at him, “how they knew.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani had been in contact with friends in the
Army who had talked to” their gunners, and the reports were adamant on one
thing: The British raid had involved two airplanes. There had been two more
higher up, hut it was assumed these were fighters giving cover; certainly they
had not dropped any bombs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the Army, Rahmani had talked to Air Force
Opera-lions Planning. Their view—and several of their officers were
Western-trained—was that no target of great military significance would ever
merit only a two-plane strike. No way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So, reasoned Rahmani, if the British did not
think the car junkyard was a scrap metal dump, what did they think it was? The
answer probably lay with the two downed British airmen. Personally, he would
have loved to conduct the interrogations, convinced that with certain
hallucinogenic drugs he could have them talking within hours, and truthfully.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Army had confirmed they had caught the
pilot and navigator within three hours of the raid, out in the desert, one
limping from a broken ankle. Unfortunately, a detail from the AMAM had turned
up with remarkable speed and taken the fliers with them. No one argued with the
AMAM. So the two Britishers were now with Omar Khatib, and Allah have mercy on
them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Cheated of his chance to shine by producing the
information supplied by the fliers, Rahmani realized he would have to
contribute something. The question was—what? The only thing that would suffice
was what the Rais wanted. And what would he want? Why, a conspiracy. Then a
conspiracy he would have. The key would be the transmitter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He reached for his phone and called Major
Mohsen Zayeed, the head of his unit’s sigint section, the people charged with
intercepting radio transmissions. It was time they talked again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Twenty miles west of Baghdad lies the small town of Abu
Ghraib, a most unremarkable place and yet a name known if rarely mentioned
throughout Iraq. For in Abu Ghraib stood the great prison, confined almost
exclusively to use in the interrogation and confinement of political detainees.
As such, it was staffed and run not by the national prison service but by the
Secret Police, the AMAM.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the time Hassan Rahmani was calling his
sigint expert, a long black Mercedes approached the double wooden doors of the
prison. Two guards, recognizing the occupant of the car, hurled themselves at
the gates and dragged them open. Just in time; the man in the car could respond
with icy brutality to those causing him a momentary delay through slackness on the
job.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The car went through, the gates closed. The
figure in the back acknowledged the efforts of the guards with neither nod nor
gesture. They were irrelevant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the steps to the main office building, the
car stopped, and another guard ran to open the rear passenger door. Brigadier
Omar Khatib alighted, trim in a tailored <i>barathea</i> uniform, and stalked
up the steps. Doors were hastily opened for him all the way. A junior officer,
an aide, brought his attaché case.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To reach his office, Khatib took the elevator
to the fifth and top floor, and when he was alone, he ordered Turkish coffee
and began to study his papers. The reports of the day detailed progress in the
extraction of needed information from those in the basement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Behind his facade, Omar Khatib was as worried
as his colleague across Baghdad—a man whom he loathed with the same venom as
the feeling was returned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Unlike Rahmani, who with his part-English
education, grasp of languages, and cosmopolitan airs was bound to be inherently
suspect, Khatib could count on the fundamental advantage of being from Tikrit.
So long as he did the job with which he had been tasked by the Rais, and did it
well, keeping the confessions of treachery flowing to assuage the unappeasable
paranoia, he was safe.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the last twenty-four hours had been
troubling. He too had received a telephone call the previous day, but from the son-in-law,
Hussein Kamil. Like Ibrahim to Rahmani, Kamil had brought news of the Rais’s
unbounded rage over the bombing of Al Qubai and was demanding results.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Unlike Rahmani, Khatib actually had the British
fliers in his hands. That was an advantage on the one hand, a snare on the
other. The Rais would want to know, and fast, just how the fliers had been
briefed before the mission—just how much did the Allies know about Al Qubai,
and how had they learned it?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was up to him, Khatib, to produce that
information. His men had been working on the fliers for fifteen hours, since
seven the previous evening, when they had arrived at Abu Ghraib. So far, the
fools had held out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the courtyard below his window came the
sound of a hiss, a thwack, and a low whimper. Khatib’s brow furrowed in
puzzlement, then cleared as he recalled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the inner yard below his window an Iraqi
hung by his wrists from a crossbeam, his pointed toes just four inches above
the dust. Nearby stood a ewer brimming with brine, once clear, now darkly pink.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Every guard and soldier crossing the yard was
under standing orders to pause, take one of the two rattan canes from the jar,
and administer a single stroke to the back of the hanging man, between the neck
and the knees. A corporal under an awning nearby kept the tally.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The stupid fellow was a market trader who had
been heard to refer to the President as the son of a whore and was now learning,
albeit a trifle late, the true measure of respect that citizens should maintain
at all times in reference to the Rais.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The intriguing thing was that he was still
there. It just showed what stamina some of these working-class people had. The
trader had sustained more than five hundred strokes already, an impressive
record. He would be dead before the thousandth—no one had ever sustained a
thousand—but it was interesting all the same. The other interesting thing was
that the man had been denounced by his ten-year-old son. Omar Khatib sipped his
coffee, unscrewed his rolled-gold fountain pen, and bent over his papers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Half an hour later, there was a discreet tap at
his door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Enter,” he called, and looked up in
expectation. He needed good news, and only one man could knock without being
announced by the junior officer outside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man who entered was burly, and his own
mother would have been hard put to call him handsome. The face was deeply
pitted by boyhood smallpox, and two circular scars gleamed where cysts had been
removed. He closed the door and stood, waiting to be addressed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though he was only a sergeant, his stained
coveralls carried not even that rank, yet he was one of the few men with whom
the brigadier felt any fellow feeling. Alone among the staff of the prison,
Sergeant Ali was permitted to sit in his presence, when invited.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib gestured the man to a chair and offered
him a cigarette. The sergeant lit up and puffed gratefully; his work was
onerous and tiring, the cigarette a welcome break. The reason Khatib tolerated
such familiarity from a man of such low rank was that he harbored a genuine
admiration for Ali. Khatib held efficiency in high esteem, and his trusted
sergeant was one who had never failed him. Calm, methodical, a good husband and
father, Ali was a true professional.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The navigator is close, very close, sir. The
pilot ...” He shrugged. “An hour or more.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I remind you they must both be broken, Ali,
nothing held back. And their stories must conform to each other. The Rais
himself is counting on us.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Perhaps you should come, sir. I think in ten
minutes you will have your answer. The navigator first, and when the pilot
learns this, he will follow.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Very well.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib rose, and the sergeant held the door
open for him. Together they descended past the ground floor to the first
basement level, where the elevator stopped. There was a passage leading to the
stairs to the subbasement. Along the passage were steel doors, and behind them,
squatting amid their filth, were seven American aircrew, four British, one
Italian, and a Kuwaiti Sky hawk pilot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the next level down were more cells, two
occupied. Khatib peered through the Judas-hole in the door of the first.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A single unshaded light bulb illuminated the
cell, its walls encrusted with hardened excrement and other brown stains of old
blood. In the center, on a plastic office chair, sat a man, quite naked, down
whose chest ran slicks of vomit, blood, and saliva. His hands were cuffed
behind him, and a cloth mask with no eye-slits covered his face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two AMAM men in coveralls similar to those of
Sergeant Ali flanked the man in the chair, their hands caressing yard-long
plastic tubes packed with bitumen, which adds weight without reducing
flexibility. They were standing back, taking a break. Before their
interruption, they had apparently been concentrating on the shins and kneecaps,
which were skinned raw and turning blue-yellow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib nodded and passed to the next door.
Through the hole he could see that the second prisoner was not masked. One eye
was completely closed, the pulped meat of the brow and cheek knit together by
crusted blood. When he opened his mouth, there were gaps where two broken teeth
had been, and a froth of blood emerged from the mashed lips.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Tyne,” the navigator whispered, “Nicholas
Tyne. Flight lieutenant. Five oh one oh nine six eight.” “The navigator,”
whispered the sergeant. Khatib whispered back, “Which of our men is the
English-speaker?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ali gestured—the one on the left. “Bring him
out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ali entered the cell of the navigator and
emerged with one of the interrogators. Khatib had a conference with the man in
Arabic. The man nodded, reentered the cell, and masked the navigator. Only then
would Khatib allow both cell doors to be opened.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The English-speaker bent toward Nicky Tyne’s
head and spoke through the cloth. His English was heavily accented but
passable.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, Flight Lieutenant, that is it. For
you, it is over. No more punishment.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young navigator heard the words. His body
seemed to slump in relief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But your friend, he is not so lucky. He is
dying now. So we can take him to the hospital—clean white sheets, doctors,
everything he needs; or we can finish the job. Your choice. When you tell us,
we stop and rush him to hospital.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib nodded down the corridor to Sergeant
Ali, who entered the other cell. From the open door came the sounds of a
plastic quirt lashing a bare chest. Then the pilot began to scream.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, shells!” shouted Nicky Tyne under
his cowl. “Stop it, you bastards! It was an ammunition dump, for poison gas
shells. ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The beating ceased. Ali emerged, breathing
heavily, from the pilot’s cell.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are a genius, <i>Sayid</i> Brigadier.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib shrugged modestly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Never underestimate the sentimentality of the
British and the Americans,” he told his pupil. “Get the translators now. Get
all the details, every last one. When you have the transcripts, bring them to
my office.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Back in his sanctum, Brigadier Khatib made a
personal phone call to Hussein Kamil. An hour later, Kamil called him back. His
father-in-law was delighted; a meeting would be summoned, probably that night.
Omar Khatib should hold himself available for the summons.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That evening, Karim was teasing Edith again, gently and
without malice, this time about her job.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t you ever get bored at the bank, darling?”
“No, it’s an interesting job. Why do you ask?” “Oh, I don’t know. I just don’t
understand how you can think it interesting. For me, it would be the most
boring job in the world.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, it’s not, so there.” “All right. What’s
so interesting about it?” “You know, handling accounts, placing investments,
that sort of thing. It’s important work.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nonsense. It’s about saying ‘Good morning, yes
sir, no sir, of course sir’ to lots of people running in and out to cash a fifty-schilling
check. Boring.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was lying on his back on her bed. She walked
over and lay beside him, pulling one of his arms around her shoulders so that
they could cuddle. She loved to cuddle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are crazy sometimes, Karim. But I love you
crazy. Winkler Bank isn’t an issuing bank—it’s a merchant bank.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What’s the difference?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have no checking accounts, customers with
checkbooks running in and out. It doesn’t work like that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So you have no money, without customers.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course we have money, but in deposit
accounts.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Never had one of those,” admitted Karim. “Just
a small current account. I prefer cash anyway.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You can’t have cash when you are talking of
millions, People would steal it. So you put it in a bank and invest it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You mean old Gemütlich handles millions? Of
other people’s money?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, millions and millions.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Schillings or dollars?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Dollars, pounds, millions and millions.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, I wouldn’t trust him with <i>my</i>
money.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She sat up, genuinely shocked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Herr Gemütlich is completely honest. He would
never dream of doing that.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe not, but somebody else might. Look—say,
I know a man who has an account at Winkler. His name is Schmitt. One day I go
in and say: Good morning, Herr Gemütlich, my name is Schmitt, and I have an
account here. He looks in his book, and he says: Yes, you do. So I say: I’d
like to withdraw it all. Then when the real Schmitt turns up, there’s nothing
left. That’s why cash is better for me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She laughed at his naïveté and pulled him down,
nibbling his ear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It wouldn’t work. Herr Gemütlich would
probably know your precious Schmitt. Anyway, he’d have to identify himself.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Passports can be forged. Those damned
Palestinians do it all the time.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And he’d need a signature, of which he would
have a specimen copy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So, I’d practice forging Schmitt’s signature.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Karim, I think you might turn out to be a
criminal one day. You’re bad.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They both giggled at the idea.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Anyway, if you were a foreigner and living
abroad, you’d probably have a numbered account. They are completely
impregnable.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He looked down at her from one elbow, brow
furrowed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A numbered account?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Mmmmmm.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She explained how they worked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s madness,” he exploded when she had
finished. “Anybody could turn up and claim ownership. If Gemütlich has never
even seen the owner—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There are identity procedures, idiot. Very
complex codes, methods of writing letters, certain ways the signatures have to
be placed—all sorts of things to verify that the person is really the account
owner. Unless they are all complied with—to the letter—Herr Gemütlich will not
cooperate. So impersonation is impossible.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He must have a hell of a memory.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, you are too stupid for words. It is all
written down. Are you taking me out to dinner?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do you deserve it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You know I do.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, all right. But I want an hors d’oeuvre.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was puzzled. “All right, order one.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I mean you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He reached out and grabbed the waist of her
skimpy panties, pulling her with a hooked finger back onto the bed. She was
giggling with delight. He rolled over on top of her and began to kiss. Suddenly
he stopped. She looked alarmed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know what I’d do,” he breathed. “I’d hire a
safecracker, break into old Gemütlich’s safe, and look at the codes. Then I
could get away with it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She laughed in relief that he had not changed
his mind about making love.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Wouldn’t work. Mmmmmm. Do that again.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Would so.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Aaaaaah. Wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Would. Safes are broken all the time. See it
in the papers every day.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She ran her exploring hand below, and her eyes
opened wide.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ooooh, is that all for me? You’re a lovely,
big, strong man, Karim, and I love you. But old Gemütlich, as you call him, is
a bit smarter than you. ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A minute later, she no longer cared how smart Gemütlich
was.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>While the Mossad agent made love in Vienna, Mike Martin
was setting up his satellite dish as midnight approached and the eleventh of
the month gave way to the twelfth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Iraq was then just eight days away from the
scheduled invasion of February 20. South of the border, the northern slice of
the desert of Saudi Arabia bristled with the biggest single concentration of
men and arms, guns, tanks, and stores crammed into such a relatively small
piece of land since the Second World War.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The relentless pounding from the air went on,
though most of the targets on General Horner’s original list had been visited,
sometimes twice or more. Despite the insertion of fresh targets caused by the
short-lived Scud barrage on Israel, the air master plan was back on track.
Every <i>known</i> factory for the production of weapons of mass destruction
had been pulverized, and that included twelve new ones added by information
from Jericho.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As a functioning weapon, the Iraqi Air Force
had virtually ceased to exist. Rarely had her interceptor fighters, if they
chose to tangle with the Eagles, Hornets, Tomcats, Falcons, Phantoms, and
Jaguars of the Allies, returned to their bases, and by mid-February they were
not even bothering to try. Some of the cream of the fighter and fighter-bomber
force had deliberately been sent to Iran, where they had at once been
impounded. Others still had been destroyed inside their hardened shelters or
ripped apart if caught out in the open.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the highest level, the Allied commanders
could not understand why Saddam had chosen to send the cream of his warplanes
to his old enemy. The reason was that after a certain date he firmly expected
every nation in the region to have no choice but to bow the knee to him; at
that point he would recover his war fleet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was by then hardly a bridge left intact
in the entire country or a functioning power-generating station.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By mid-February, an increasing Allied air
effort was being directed at the Iraqi Army in south Kuwait and over the
Kuwaiti border into Iraq itself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the east-west Saudi northern border up to the
Baghdad-Basra highway, the Buffs were pounding the artillery, tank,
rocket-battery, and infantry positions. American A-10 Thunderbolts, nicknamed
for their grace in the sky “the flying warthog,” were roaming at will doing
what they did best—destroying tanks. Eagles and Tornados were also allocated
the task of “tank-plinking.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What the Allied generals in Riyadh did not know
was that forty major facilities dedicated to weapons of mass destruction still
remained hidden beneath the deserts and the mountains, or that the Sixco air
bases were still intact.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Since the burial of the Al Qubai factory, the
mood was lighter both among the four generals who knew what it had really
contained, as it was among the men of the CIA and the SIS stationed in Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a mood mirrored in the brief message
Mike Martin received that night. His controllers in Riyadh began by informing
him of the success of the Tornado mission despite the loss of one airplane. The
transmission went on to congratulate him for staying in Baghdad after being
allowed to leave, and on the entire mission. Finally, he was told there was
little more to do. Jericho should be sent one final message, to the effect the
Allies were grateful, that all his money had been paid, and that contact would
be reestablished after the war. Then, Martin was told, he really should escape
to safety in Saudi Arabia before it became impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin closed down his set, packed it away
beneath the floor, and lay on his bed before sleeping. Interesting, he thought.
The armies are not coming to Baghdad. What about Saddam—wasn’t that the object
of the exercise? Something had changed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Had he been aware of the conference then taking place in
the headquarters of the Mukhabarat not half a mile away, Mike Martin’s sleep
would not have been so easy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In matters of technical skill there are four
levels—competent, very good, brilliant, and a natural. The last category goes
beyond mere skill and into an area where all technical knowledge is backed by
an innate feel, a gut instinct, a sixth sense, an empathy with the subject and
the machinery that cannot be taught in textbooks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In matters of radio, Major Mohsen Zayeed was a
natural. Quite young, with owlish spectacles that gave him the air of an
earnest student, Zayeed lived, ate, and breathed the technology of radio. His
private quarters were strewn with the latest magazines from the West, and when
he came across a new device that might increase the efficiency of his
radio-interception department, he asked for it. Because he valued the man,
Hassan Rahmani tried to get it for him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shortly after midnight, the two men sat in
Rahmani’s office.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Any progress?” asked Rahmani.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think so,” replied Zayeed. “He’s there, all
right—no doubt about it. The trouble is, he’s using burst transmissions that
are almost impossible to capture. They take place so fast. Almost, but not
quite. With skill and patience, one can occasionally find one, even though the
bursts may only be a few seconds long.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How close are you?” said Rahmani.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, I’ve tracked the transmission
frequencies to a fairly narrow band in the ultra-high-frequency range, which
makes life easier. Several days ago, I got lucky. We were monitoring a narrow
band on the off-chance, and he came on the air. Listen.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Zayeed produced a tape recorder and pushed
Play. A jumbled mess of sound filled the office. Rahmani looked perplexed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s encrypted, of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course,” said Rahmani. “Can you break it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Almost certainly not. The encryption is by a
single silicon chip, patterned with complex microcircuitry.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It can’t be decoded?” Rahmani was getting
lost; Zayeed lived in his own private world and spoke his own private language.
He was already making a great effort to try and speak plainly to his commanding
officer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s not a code. To convert that jumble back
to the original speech would need an identical silicon chip. The permutations
are in the hundreds of millions.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then what’s the point?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The point, sir, is—I got a bearing on it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hassan Rahmani leaned forward in excitement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A bearing?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“My second. And guess what? That message was
sent in the middle of the night, thirty hours before the bombing of Al Qubai.
My guess is, the details of the nuclear plant were in it. There’s more.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Go on.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Here in Baghdad?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Major Zayeed smiled and shook his head. He had
saved his best piece of news till last. He wanted to be appreciated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, sir, he’s here in the Mansour district. I
think he’s inside an area two kilometers by two.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani thought furiously. This was getting
close, amazingly close. The phone rang. He listened for several seconds, then
put it down and rose.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I am summoned. One last thing. How many more
intercepts until you can pin it right down? To a block, or even a house?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“With luck, one. I may not catch him the first
time, but at the first intercept I think I can find him. I pray he will send a
long message, several seconds on the air. Then I can give you a square one
hundred meters by one hundred.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani was breathing heavily as he descended
to the waiting car.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>They came to the meeting with the Rais in two blacked-out
buses. The seven ministers came in one, the six generals and the three
intelligence chiefs in another. None saw where they were going, and beyond the
windshield the driver simply followed the motorcycle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only when the bus drew to a halt in a walled
courtyard were the nine men in the second bus allowed to emerge. It had been a
forty-minute, indirect drive. Rahmani estimated they were in the country about
thirty miles from Baghdad. There were no sounds of traffic noise, and the stars
above showed the dim outline of a large villa with black-screened windows.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside the principal sitting room the seven
ministers were already waiting. The generals took assigned places and sat in
silence. Guards showed Dr. Ubaidi of Foreign Intelligence, Hassan Rahmani of
Counterintelligence, and Omar Khatib of the Secret Police to three seats facing
the single large padded chair reserved for the Rais himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man who had sent for them entered a few
minutes later. They all rose and were gestured to sit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For some, it had been over three weeks since
they had seen the President. He seemed strained, the bags under his eyes and
jowls more pronounced.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Without preamble, Saddam Hussein launched into
the business of their meeting. There had been a bombing raid—they all knew
about it, even those who before the raid had known nothing of a place called Al
Qubai.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The place was so secret that no more than a
dozen men in Iraq knew exactly where it was. Yet it had been bombed. None but
the highest in the land and a few dedicated technicians had ever visited the
place except blindfolded or in sealed transportation, yet it had been bombed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was silence in the room, the silence of
fear. The generals—Radi of the Infantry, Kadiri of the Armored Corps, Ridha of
the Artillery, and Musuli of the Engineers, and the other two, the head of the
Republican Guard and the Chief of Staff—stared fixedly at the carpet ahead of
them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Our comrade, Omar Khatib, had interrogated the
two British fliers, intoned the Rais. He would now explain what had happened.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>No one had stared at the Rais, but now all eyes
went to the rake-thin form of Omar Khatib.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Tormentor kept his gaze on the midsection
of the head of state, facing him across the room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The airmen had talked, he said flatly. They had
held nothing back. They had been told by their squadron commander that Allied
aircraft had seen trucks, Army trucks, moving into and out of a certain
automobile junkyard. From this, the Sons of Dogs had gained the impression that
the yard disguised an ammunition dump, specifically a depository for poison gas
shells. It was not regarded as high priority and was not thought to have any
antiaircraft defenses. So only two planes had been assigned to the mission,
with two more above them to mark the target. There had been no protecting
aircraft assigned to suppress the triple-A, because it was not thought there
was any. They—the pilot and the navigator—knew nothing more than that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Rais nodded at General Farouk Ridha. “True
or false, <i>Rafeek</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It is normal, <i>Sayid Rais</i>,” said the man
who commanded the artillery and SAM missile sites, “for them to send in first
the missile fighters to hit the defenses, then the bombers for the target. They
always do that. For a high-priority target, two airplanes only and no support
has never happened.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Saddam mused on the answer, his dark eyes
betraying nothing of his thoughts. That was a part of the power he held over
these men; they never knew which way he would react.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Is there any chance, <i>Rafeek</i> Khatib,
that these men have hidden things from you, that they know more than they have
said?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, Rais. They have been ... persuaded to
cooperate completely.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then that is the end of the matter?” asked the
Rais quietly. “The raid was just an unfortunate chance?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Heads nodded round the room. The scream when it
came paralyzed them all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Wrong</i>! You are all wrong!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In a second the voice dropped back to a calm
whisper, but the fear had been instilled. They all knew that the softness of
the voice could precede the most terrible of revelations, the most savage of
penalties.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There have been no trucks, no Army trucks. An
excuse given to the pilots in case they were caught. There is something more,
is there not?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Most of them were sweating despite the air conditioning.
It had always been thus, since the dawn of history, when the tyrant of a tribe
called in the witch-finder and the tribe sat and trembled lest he should be the
one at whom the juju-stick pointed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There is a conspiracy,” whispered the Rais. “There
is a traitor. Someone is a traitor, who conspires against me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He stayed silent for several minutes, letting
them tremble. When he spoke again, it was to the three men who faced him across
the room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Find him. Find him and bring him to me. He
shall learn the punishment for such crimes. He and all his family.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then he swept from the room followed by his
personal bodyguard. The sixteen men left behind did not even look at each
other, could not meet another’s gaze. There would be a sacrifice. No one knew who
it would be. Each feared for himself, for some chance remark, perhaps not even
that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Fifteen of the men kept distance from the last,
the witch-finder, the one they called Al-Mu’azib, the Tormentor. He would
produce the sacrifice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hassan Rahmani too kept silent. This was no
time to mention radio intercepts. His operations were delicate, subtle, based
on detection and real intelligence. The last thing he needed was to find the
thumping boots of the AMAM trampling all over his investigations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In a mood of terror the ministers and generals
departed back into the night and to their duties.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“He doesn’t keep them in his office safe,” said Avi
Herzog, alias Karim, to his controller Gidi Barzilai over a late breakfast the
next morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The meeting was safe, in Barzilai’s own
apartment. Herzog had not made the phone call, from a public booth, until Edith
Hardenberg was safely in the bank. Shortly after, the yarid team had arrived,
boxing in their colleague as they escorted him to the rendezvous to ensure
there was no chance he was being followed. Had he grown a tail, they would have
seen it. It was their speciality.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Gidi Barzilai leaned forward across the
food-strewn table, eyes alight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well done, boychick. So now I know where he
doesn’t keep the codes. The point is, where?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In his desk.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The desk? You’re mad. Anyone can open a desk.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Have you seen it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Gemütlich’s desk? No.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Apparently it is very big, very ornate, and
very old. A real antique. Also, it has a compartment, created by the original
cabinetmaker, so secret, so hard to find, that Gemütlich thinks it is safer
than any safe. He believes a burglar might go for the safe but would never
think of the desk. Even if a burglar went through the desk, he would never find
the compartment.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And she doesn’t know where it is?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nope. Never seen it opened. He always locks
himself in the office when he has to refer to it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barzilai thought it over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Cunning bastard. I wouldn’t have given him
credit for it. You know, he’s probably right.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Can I break it off now—the affair?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, Avi, not yet. If you’re right, you’ve done
brilliantly. But stick around, keep play-acting. If you vanish now, she will think
back to your last conversation, put two and two together, have a fit of
remorse, whatever. Stay with her, talk, but never again about banking.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barzilai thought over his problem. No one of
his team in Vienna had ever seen the safe, but there was one man who had.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barzilai sent a heavily coded message to Kobi
Dror in Tel Aviv. The spotter was brought in and sat in a room with an artist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The spotter was not multitalented, but he had
one amazing skill: He had a photographic memory. For over five hours he sat
with his eyes closed and cast his mind back to the interview he had had with Gemütlich
while posing as a lawyer from New York. His principal task had been to look for
alarm catches on windows and doors, for a wall safe, wires indicating pressure
pads—all the tricks for keeping a room secure. These he had noted and reported.
The desk had not interested him too much. But sitting in a room beneath King
Saul Boulevard weeks later, he could close his eyes and see it all again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Line by line, he described the desk to the
artist. Sometimes the spotter would look at the drawing, make a correction, and
resume. The artist worked in India ink with a fine pen and colored the desk
with watercolors. After five hours the artist had a sheet of the finest
cartridge paper on which was an exact colored picture of the desk then sitting
in the office of Herr Wolfgang Gemütlich at the Winkler Bank in the Ballgasse,
Vienna.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The drawing went to Gidi Barzilai in the
diplomatic pouch from Tel Aviv to the Israeli embassy in Austria. He had it
within two days.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before then a check on the list of <i>sayanim</i>
across all Europe had revealed the existence of Monsieur Michel Levy, an
antiquarian on the Boulevard Raspail in Paris, noted as one of the leading
experts on classical furniture on the continent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was not until the night of the fourteenth, the same day
Barzilai received his watercolor painting in Vienna, that Saddam Hussein
reconvened his meeting of ministers, generals, and intelligence chiefs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Again the meeting was called at the behest of
AMAM chief Omar Khatib, who had passed news of his success via the son-in-law
Hussein Kamil, and again it was in a villa in the dead of night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Rais simply entered the room and gestured
to Khatib to report upon his findings.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What can I say, <i>Sayid Rais</i>?” The head
of the Secret Police raised his hands and let them drop in a gesture of
helplessness. It was a masterpiece in the acting of self-deprecation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Rais was, as ever, right, and we were all
wrong. The bombing of Al Qubai was indeed no accident. There was a traitor, and
he has been found.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a buzz of sycophantic amazement
around the room. The man in the upright padded chair with his back to the
windowless wall beamed and held up his hands for such unnecessary applause to
cease. It did, but not too quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Was I not right? the smile said. Am I not
always right?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How did you discover this, <i>Rafeek</i>?” asked
the Rais.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A combination of good luck and detective work,”
admitted Khatib modestly. “As for the good fortune, this as we know is the gift
of Allah, who smiles upon our Rais.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was an assenting rumble around the room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Two days before the attack by the bombers of
the Beni Naji, a traffic control point was established on a road nearby. It was
a routine spot check by my men on movements by possible deserters, contraband
goods. ... The vehicle numbers were noted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Two days ago I checked these and found that
most of the vehicles were local—vans and trucks. But one was an expensive car,
registered here in Baghdad. The owner was traced, a man who might have had
reason to visit Al Qubai. But a telephone call ascertained that he had <i>not </i>visited
the facility. Why, I wondered, had he been in the area, then?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Hassan Rahmani nodded. That was good detective
work, if it was true. And it was unlike Khatib who usually relied on brute
force.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And why was he there?” asked the Rais.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib paused to let the revelation sink in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“To note a precise description of the
aboveground car junkyard, to define the distance from the nearest major
landmark and the exact compass bearing—everything an Air Force would need to
find it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a universal exhalation of breath
around the room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But that came later, <i>Sayid Rais</i>. First
I invited the man to join me at AMAM headquarters for a little frank talk.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib’s mind strayed back to the frank
conversation in the basement beneath the AMAM headquarters in Saadun, Baghdad,
that basement known as the Gymnasium.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Habitually, Omar Khatib had his underlings
conduct interrogations, contenting himself to decree the level of severity and
supervise the outcome. But this had been a matter of such delicacy that he had
accomplished the task himself, banning all others beyond the soundproof door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From the roof of the cell jutted two steel
hooks, a yard apart, and from them hung two short chains hooked to a timber
bar. The wrists of the suspect he had had lashed to the ends of the bar, so the
man hung with arms a yard apart. Because the arms were not vertical, the strain
was all the greater.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The feet were four inches off the floor, the
ankles tied to another yard-long pole. The X-shaped configuration of the
prisoner gave access to all parts of the body, and because he hung in the
center of the room, he could be approached from all sides.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Omar Khatib had laid the clotted rattan cane on
a side table and came around to the front. The manic screaming of the man under
the first fifty lashes had ceased, dying to a mumbling burble of pleas. Khatib
stared him in the face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are a fool, my friend. You could end all
this so easily. You have betrayed the Rais, but he is merciful. All I need is
your confession.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, I swear ... <i>wa-Allah-d-Adheem </i>...
by Allah the Great, I have betrayed no one.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man was weeping like a child, tears of
agony pouring down his face. He was soft, Khatib noted; this will not take
long.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, you have betrayed. Qubth-ut-Allah—you
know what that means?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course,” whimpered the man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And you know where it was stored for safety?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib brought his knee hard upward into the
exposed testicles. The man would have liked to double up but could not. He
vomited, the slick running down his bare body to dribble off the end of his
penis.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes—what?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, <i>sayidi</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Better. And where the Fist of God was hidden—that
was not known to our enemies?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, <i>sayidi</i>, it is a secret.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib’s hand flashed out and caught the
hanging man across the face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Monyouk</i>, filthy <i>monyouk</i>, then
how is it that this very morning at dawn, the enemy planes bombed it and
destroyed our weapon?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The prisoner opened his eyes wide, his shock
overcoming his shame at the insult. <i>Monyouk</i> in Arabic is the man who
plays the female role in a homosexual coupling.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But that is not possible. No one but a few
know about Al Qubai—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But the enemy knew. ... They have destroyed
it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sayidi, I swear, this is impossible. They
could never find it. The man who built it, Colonel Badri, disguised it too well.
...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The interrogation had continued for a further
half hour until its inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib was interrupted from his reverie by the
Rais himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And who is he, our traitor?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The engineer, Dr. Salah Siddiqui, Rais.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a gasp. The President nodded slowly,
as if he had suspected the man all along.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Might one ask,” said Hassan Rahmani, “who the
wretch was working for?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib darted a look of venom at Rahmani and
took his time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This he did not say, <i>Sayid Rais</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But he will, he will,” said the President.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Sayid Rais</i>,” murmured Khatib, “I’m
afraid I have to report that at this point of his confession, the traitor died.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani was on his feet, protocol ignored. “Mr.
President, I must protest. This shows the most amazing incompetence. The
traitor must have had a link line through to the enemy, some way of sending his
messages. Now we may never know.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Khatib shot him a look of such pure hate that
Rahmani, who had read Kipling as a boy in Mr. Hartley’s school, was reminded of
Krait, the dust-snake who hissed “Beware, for I am death.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What have you to say?” asked the Rais. Khatib
was contrite! “<i>Sayid Rais</i>, what can I say? The men who serve under me
love you as their own father—nay, more. They would die for you. When they heard
this traitorous filth pouring out ... there was an excess of zeal.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bullshit, thought Rahmani. But the Rais was
nodding slowly. It was the sort of language he liked to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It is understandable,” the Rais said. “These
things happen. And you, Brigadier Rahmani, who criticize your colleague, have
you had any success?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was noticeable that Rahmani was not referred
to as <i>Rafeek</i>, “Comrade.” He would have to be careful, very careful. “There
is a transmitter, <i>Sayid Rais</i>, in Baghdad.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He went on to reveal what Major Zayeed had told
him. He thought of adding one last phrase—“One more transmission, if we can
catch it, and I think we will have the sender”—but he decided it could wait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then since the traitor is dead,” said the
Rais, “I can reveal to you what I could not say two days ago. The Fist of God
is not destroyed, not even buried. Twenty-four hours before the bombing raid, I
ordered it to be removed to a safer place.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took several seconds for the applause to die
down as the inner circle expressed their admiration for the sheer genius of the
leader.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He told them the device had gone to the
Fortress, whose whereabouts did not concern them, and from the Qa’ala it would
be launched, to change all history, on the day the first combat boot of an
American soldier stepped onto the holy land of Iraq.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942771">Chapter 20</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The news that the British Tornados had missed their real
target at Al Qubai badly shook the man known only as Jericho. It was as much as
he could do to force himself to his feet and applaud the Rais with the
adoration of all the rest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the blacked-out bus with the other generals
being transported back into central Baghdad, he had sat in silence in back,
wrapped in his own thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That the use of the device now hidden elsewhere—at
a place called Qa’ala, the Fortress, of which he had never heard and whose location
he did not know—might cause many, many deaths, he cared not a jot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was his own position that absorbed him. For
three years he had risked everything—exposure, ruin, and a terrible death—to
betray his country’s regime. The point had not simply been to establish a huge
personal fortune abroad; that he could probably have done by extortion and
theft right here in Iraq, though there would have been risks to that as well.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The point had been to retire abroad with a new
identity and background, provided by his foreign paymasters, secure under their
mantle, safe from the vengeful assassination squads. He had seen the fate of
those who simply stole and fled; they lived constantly in fear until, one day,
the Iraqi avengers caught up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He, Jericho, wanted both his fortune and
security, which was why he had welcomed the transfer of his control from Israel
to the Americans. They would look after him, abide by the agreement, and create
the new identity, allowing him to become another man with another nationality,
buy his mansion by the sea in Mexico, and live out a life of ease and comfort.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now things had changed. If he kept silent and
the device were used, the Americans would think he had lied about Al Qubai. He
had not, but in their rage they would never believe that. Come hell or high
water, the Americans would reject his account, and it would all have been for
nothing. Somehow he had to warn them that there had been a mistake. A few more
risks, and it would all be over—Iraq defeated, the Rais brought down, and he,
Jericho, out of there and far away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the privacy of his office he wrote his
message, as always in Arabic, on the thin paper that took up so little space.
He explained the conference of that evening; that when he sent his last
message, the device had indeed been at Al Qubai, as he had said, but
forty-eight hours later when the Tornados struck, it had been moved. That this
was not his fault.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He went on to say all he knew: That there was a
secret place called the Fortress; that the device was there, and from Qa’ala it
would be launched when the first American crossed the border into Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shortly after midnight, he took an unmarked car
and disappeared into the back streets of Baghdad. No one queried his right to
do so; no one would dare. He planted the message beneath a flagstone in an old
courtyard off Abu Nawas Street, then made the chalk mark behind the Church of
St. Joseph in the Area of the Christians. This time the chalk mark was slightly
different. He hoped the unseen man who collected his messages would waste no
time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As it happened, Mike Martin left the Soviet
villa early on the morning of February 15. The Russian cook had given him a
long list of fresh produce to buy, a list that was going to prove extremely
hard to fill. Food was running short. It was not the farmers in the
countryside; it was the transportation problems. Most of the bridges were down.
The central Iraqi plain is a land of rivers watering the spread of crops that
feed Baghdad. Forced to pay ferry charges across them all, the produce-growers
were choosing to stay home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Luckily, Martin started with the spice market
in Shurja Street, then pedaled around the Church of St. Joseph to the alley at
the back. When he saw the chalk mark, he was jolted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The mark of that particular wall was always
supposed to be a figure eight on its side, with a single short stroke
horizontally through the join of the two circles. But he had warned Jericho
previously that if there were ever a real emergency, the single stroke should
be replaced by two small crosses, one in each circle of the figure eight. Today
the crosses were there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin pedaled hard to the courtyard off Abu
Nawas Street, waited till the coast was clear, stooped as always to adjust his
sandal, slid a hand into the hiding place in the wall, and found the slim
envelope. By midday, he was back at the villa, explaining to the angry cook
that he had done his best but the produce would be later than ever reaching the
city. He would have to go back in the afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he read Jericho’s message, it became all
too plain why the man was in a panic. Martin composed a message of his own,
explaining to Riyadh why he now felt he had been forced to take matters into
his own hands and make his own decision. There was no time left for conferences
in Riyadh and a further interchange of messages. The worst part, for him, was
Jericho’s revelation that Iraqi Counterintelligence was aware of an illegal
transmitter sending burst signals. He could not know how close they were, but
he had to assume there could be no further extended exchange of messages with
Riyadh. Therefore he was making the decision himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin read the Jericho message in Arabic
first, then his own translation, into the tape recorder. He added his own
message and prepared to send.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had no transmission window until late in the
night—the night was always chosen so that the Kulikov household would be fast
asleep. But, like Jericho, he did have an emergency procedure.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was the transmission of a single long blast
of sound, in this case a high-pitched whistle, on a completely different
frequency, well outside the usual VHF band.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He checked that the Iraqi chauffeur was with
First Secretary Kulikov at the embassy in the city center and that the Russian
houseman and his wife were at lunch. Then, despite the risk of discovery, he
erected the satellite dish near the open doorway and sent the whistle blast.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the radio shack, a former bedroom in the SIS
villa in Riyadh, a single light flashed on. It was half past one in the
afternoon. The duty radio operator, handling the normal traffic between the
villa and Century House in London, dropped what he was doing, yelled through
the door for backup, and tuned to Receive on Martin’s frequency-of-the-day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second operator put his head around the
door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What’s up?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Get Steve and Simon. Black Bear’s coming on,
and it’s an emergency.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man left. Martin gave Riyadh fifteen
minutes, then ran his main transmission.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Riyadh was not the only radio mast that caught
the burst. Outside Baghdad, another satellite dish, sweeping the VHF band
relentlessly, caught part of it. The message was so long that, even shortened,
it lasted four seconds. The Iraqi listeners caught the last two and got a fix.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As soon as he had sent, Martin closed down and
packed away his equipment beneath the tiles of his floor. Hardly had he done so
than he heard footsteps on the gravel. It was the Russian houseman who, in a
fit of generosity, had crossed the yard to offer him a Balkan cigarette. Martin
accepted it with much bobbing and bowing and mutterings of “<i>Shukran</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Russian, proud of his good nature, walked
back to the house. “Poor bastard,” he thought. “What a life.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he was alone again, the poor bastard began
to write in closely scripted Arabic on the pad of airmail paper he kept under
his pallet. As he did so, the radio genius called Major Zayeed pored over a
very-large-scale map of the city, particularly of the district of Mansour. When
he had finished his calculations, he double-checked them and called Brigadier
Hassan Rahmani at the Mukhabarat headquarters, barely five hundred yards from
the diamond-shaped lozenge of Mansour that had been traced out in green ink.
His appointment was fixed for four o’clock.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In Riyadh, Chip Barber was stomping around the main
sitting room of the villa with a print-out in his hand, swearing in a manner he
had not done since leaving the Marines thirty years earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What the hell does he think he’s doing?” he
demanded of the two British intelligence officers in the room with him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Easy, Chip,” said Laing. “He’s had a hell of a
long run. He’s under massive strain. The bad guys are closing in. All our
tradecraft tells us we should get him out of there—now.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yeah, I know, he’s a great guy. But he has no
right to do this. We’re the people picking up the tab, remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We do remember,” said Paxman, “but he’s our
man, and he’s miles out in the cold. If he chooses to stay on, it’s to finish
the job, as much for you as for us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber calmed down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Three million dollars. How the hell am I to
tell Langley he has offered Jericho a further three million greenbacks to get
it right this time? That Iraqi asshole should have gotten it right the first
time. For all we know, he could be dealing from the bottom of the deck, just to
make more money.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Chip,” said Laing, “we’re talking about a nuke
here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe,” growled Barber, “<i>maybe</i> we’re
talking about a nuke. <i>Maybe</i> Saddam got enough uranium in time, <i>maybe</i>
he put it all together in time. All we really have are the calculations of some
scientists and Saddam’s claim—if indeed he ever made the claim at all. Dammit,
Jericho is a mercenary, he could be lying in his teeth. Scientists can be
wrong, Saddam lies as he breathes. What have we actually <i>gotten</i> for all
this money?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You want to take the risk?” asked Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barber slumped in a chair.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No,” he said at length, “no, I don’t. Okay, I’ll
clear it with Washington. Then we tell the generals. They have to know this.
But I tell you guys one thing: One day I’m going to meet this Jericho, and if
he’s putting us on, I’m going to pull his arms off and beat him to death with
the soggy end.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At four that afternoon, Major Zayeed brought
his maps and his calculations to Hassan Rahmani’s office. Carefully he
explained that he had that day secured his third triangulation and narrowed the
area down to the lozenge shown on the map of Mansour. Rahmani gazed at it
dubiously.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s a hundred yards by a hundred yards,” he
said. “I thought modern technology could get these emission sources down to a
square yard.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If I get a long transmission, yes, I can,”
explained the young major patiently. “I can get a beam from the intercepting
receiver no wider than a yard. Cross that with another intercept from a
different point, and you get your square yard. But these are terribly short
transmissions. They’re on the air and off within two seconds. The best I can
get is a very narrow cone, its point on the receiver, running out across
country and getting wider as it goes. Maybe an angle of one second of one
degree on the compass. But a couple of miles away, that becomes a hundred
yards. Look, it’s still a small area.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani peered at the map. The marked lozenge
had four buildings in it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let’s get down there and look at it,” he
suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two men prowled Mansour with the map until
they had traced the area shown. It was residential and very prosperous. The
four residences were all detached, walled, and standing in their own grounds.
It was getting dark by the time they finished.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Raid them in the morning,” said Rahmani. “I’ll
seal the area with troops, quietly. You know what you’re looking for. You go in
with your specialists and take all four places apart. You find it, we have the
spy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“One problem,” said the major. “See that brass
plaque over there? That’s a Soviet embassy residence.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani thought it over. He would get no thanks
for starting an international incident.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do the other three first,” he ordered. “If you
get nothing, I’ll clear the Soviet building with the Foreign Ministry.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While they talked, one of the staff of that
Soviet villa was three miles away. The gardener Mahmoud Al-Khouri was in the
old British cemetery, placing a slim envelope in a stone jar by a long-untended
gravestone. Later, he made a chalk mark on the wall of the Union of Journalists
building. On a late-night tour of the district, he noticed just before midnight
that the chalk mark had been expunged.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That evening, there was a conference in Riyadh, a very
private conference in a sealed office two floors below the Saudi Defense
Ministry building. There were four generals present, one of them seated at the
head of the table, and two civilians, Barber and Laing. When the civilians had
finished speaking, the four military men sat in gloomy silence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Is this for real?” asked one of the Americans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In terms of one hundred percent proof, we don’t
have that,” said Barber. “But we think there is a very high likelihood that the
information is accurate.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What makes you so sure?” asked the USAF
general.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“As you gentlemen have probably already
guessed, we have for some months past had an asset working for us high in the
hierarchy in Baghdad.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was a series of assenting grunts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Didn’t figure all that target information was
coming from Langley’s crystal ball,” said the Air Force general, who still
resented the CIA doubting his pilots’ hit record.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The point is,” said Laing, “so far, we have
never found his information to be anything but bang-on accurate. If he’s lying
now, it’s a hell of a scam. Second point is, can we take that risk?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was silence for several minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s one thing you guys are overlooking,”
said the USAF man. “Delivery.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Delivery?” asked Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Right. Having a weapon is one thing;
delivering it right on top of your enemy is another. Look, no one can believe
Saddam is into miniaturization yet. That’s hypertech. So he can’t launch this
thing, if he has it, from a tank gun. Or an artillery piece—same caliber. Or a
Katyushka-type battery. Or a rocket.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why not a rocket, General?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Payload,” said the flier sarcastically. “Goddam
payload. If this is a crude device, we have to be looking at half a ton. A
thousand pounds, say. We now know the Al-Abeid and the Al-Tammuz rockets were
still only in development when we smashed the facility at Saad-16. The Al-Abbas
and the Al-Badr, same thing. Inoperative—either smashed up or a too-small
payload.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What about the Scud?” asked Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Same thing,” said the general. “The long-range
so-called Al-Husayn keeps on breaking up on reentry and has a payload of 160
kilograms. Even the basic Soviet-supplied Scud has a maximum payload of 600
kilograms. Too small.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There’s still an aircraft-launched bomb,”
pointed out Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Air Force general glowered. “Gentlemen, I
will give you my personal guarantee, here and now: From henceforth, not one
single Iraqi warplane will reach the border. Most won’t even get off the
tarmac. Those that do and head south will be shot down halfway to the border. I
have enough AWACS, enough fighters—I can guarantee it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the Fortress?” asked Laing. “The launch
pad?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A top-secret hangar, probably underground, a
single runway leading from the mouth; housing a Mirage, a MiG, a Sukhoi—tooled
up and ready to go. But we’ll get it before the border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The decision rested with the American general
at the head of the table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Are you going to find the repository of this
device, this so-called Fortress?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, sir,” said Barber. “We are trying even
now. We figure we may need a few more days.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Find it, and we will destroy it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the invasion in four days, sir?” asked
Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I will let you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That evening, it was announced that the ground invasion of
Kuwait and Iraq had been postponed and rescheduled for the twenty-fourth of
February.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Later, historians gave two alternate reasons
for this postponement. One was that the U.S. Marines wanted to alter their main
axis of attack a few miles farther west and that this would require troop
movements, transfer of stores, and further preparations. That was true, too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A reason later advanced in the press was that
two British computer hackers had cut into the Defence Ministry computer and
badly dislocated the collation of weather reports for the attack area, causing
confusion over the choice of the best day for the attack from the climatic
point of view.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In fact, the weather was fine and clear between
the twentieth and the twenty-fourth, and it deteriorated just as the advance
began.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>General Norman Schwarzkopf was a big and very strong man,
physically, mentally, and morally. But he would have been more, or perhaps
less, than human if the sheer strain of those last few days had not begun to
tell on him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had been working up to twenty hours a day
for six months without a break. He had not only overseen the biggest and the
fastest military buildup in history, a task that alone could have broken a lesser
man, but he had coped with the complexities of relationships with the
sensitivities of Saudi society, kept the peace when a dozen times internecine
feuding could have wrecked the Coalition, and warded off endless well-meant but
useless and exhausting interventions from Capitol Hill.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>And yet it was not all this that disturbed his
much-needed sleep in those last few days. It was the sheer responsibility of
being in charge of all those young lives that brought the nightmare.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the nightmare, there was the Triangle.
Always the Triangle. It was a right-angled triangle of land, lying on its side.
What would have been the base of the triangle was the coastline from Khafji
down past Jubail to the three linked cities of Dammam, Al Khoba, and Dhahran.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The perpendicular line of the triangle was the
border running west from the coast, first between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, then
on into the desert to become the Iraqi border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The hypotenuse was the slanting line linking
the last western outpost in the desert to the coast at Dhahran.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within that triangle almost half a million
young men and women sat and waited for his order. Eighty percent of them were
Americans. In the east were the Saudis, other Arab contingents, and the
Marines. In the center were the great American armored and mechanized infantry
units, and among them was the British First Armoured Division. On the extreme
flank were the French.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Once, the nightmare had been tens of thousands
of young men pouring into the breeches for the attack, to be soaked by a rain
of poison gas and to die there between the sand walls and the razor wire. Now
it was worse.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only a week earlier, contemplating the triangle
on a battle map, an Army intelligence officer had actually suggested, “Maybe
Saddam intends to pop a nuke in there.” The man thought he was joking.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night, the commanding general tried again
to sleep and failed. Always the Triangle. Too many men, too small a space.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>At the SIS villa, Laing, Paxman, and the two radio
technicians shared a crate of beer brought covertly from the British embassy.
They too studied the map; they too saw the Triangle. They too felt the strain.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“One bloody bomb, one fucking small, crude,
first-attempt sub-Hiroshima bomb in there, air burst or ground burst ...,” said
Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They did not need to be scientists to know that
the first explosion would kill more than a hundred thousand young soldiers.
Within hours, the radiation cloud, sucking up billions of tons of active sand
from the desert, would begin to drift, covering everything in its path with
death.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The ships at sea would have time to batten
down, but not the ground troops or the people of the Saudi cities. Eastward it
would drift, widening as it went, over Bahrain and the Allied airfields,
poisoning the sea, across to the coast of Iran, there to exterminate one of the
categories Saddam Hussein had pronounced to be unworthy of life—“Persians,
Jews, and flies.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He can’t bloody launch it,” said Paxman. “He
hasn’t a rocket or plane that can do it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Far to the north, hidden in the Jebal al Hamreen, deep
inside the breech of a gun with a barrel one hundred and eighty meters long and
a range of a thousand kilometers, the Fist of God lay inert but ready to be
called to fly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The house in Qadisiyah was only half awake and quite
unprepared for the visitors who came at dawn. When the owner had built it many
years before, it had been set in the midst of orchards. It stood three miles
away from the four villas in Mansour that Major Zayeed of Counterintelligence
was even then preparing to put under surveillance. The spread of the
southwestern suburbs of Baghdad had enveloped the old house, and the new
Qadisiyah Expressway roared through what had once been fields growing peaches
and apricots.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Still, it was a fine house, owned by a
prosperous man now long retired, walled within its grounds and still retaining
some fruit trees at the bottom of the garden.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were two truckloads of AMAM soldiers
under the command of a major, and they did not stand on ceremony. The lock of
the main gate was shot off, the gate kicked open, and the soldiers poured in,
smashing the front door and beating the decrepit servant who tried to stop
them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They ran through the house, ripping open
cupboards and tearing down hangings, while the terrified old man who owned the
house tried to shield and protect his wife.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The soldiers stripped the place almost bare and
found nothing. When the old man pleaded with them to say what it was they
wanted or sought, the major roughly told him he knew perfectly well, and the
search went on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After the house, the soldiers tried the garden.
It was at the bottom near the wall that they found the freshly turned earth.
Two of them held the old man while the soldiers dug. He protested he did not
know why the earth was freshly turned; he had buried nothing. But they found it
all the same.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was in a burlap sack and all could see, when
they emptied it out, that it was a radio set.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The major knew nothing of radio sets, nor would
he have cared, had he known, that the broken-down Morse-sender model in the burlap
bag was a world away from the ultramodern satellite-based transmitter used by
Mike Martin and still beneath the floor of his shack in First Secretary Kulikov’s
garden. For the AMAM major, radios were the tricks of spies, and that was all
that mattered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man began to wail that he had never
seen it before, that someone must have come over the wall in the night to bury
it there, but the AMAM soldiers knocked him down with their rifle butts, and
his wife also when she screamed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The major examined the trophy, and even he
could see that some hieroglyphics on the containing sack appeared to be
characters in Hebrew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They did not want the house servant or the old
woman—just the man. He was over seventy, but they carried him out facedown,
gripped at each ankle and wrist by four soldiers, and threw him in the back of
one of the trucks like a sack of figs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The major was happy. Acting on an anonymous
tip, he had done his duty. His superiors would be pleased. This was not a case
for the Abu Ghraib prison. He took his prisoner to the AMAM headquarters and
the Gymnasium. That, he reasoned, was the only place for Israeli spies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That same day, February 16, Gidi Barzilai was in Paris,
showing his painting to Michel Levy. The old antiquarian <i>sayan</i> was
delighted to help. Only once had he been asked before, and that was to lend
some furniture to a <i>katsa</i> trying to gain entry to a certain house,
posing as an antique dealer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For Michel Levy it was a pleasure and an
excitement, something to enliven the existence of an old man, to be consulted
by the Mossad, to be able to help in some way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Boulle,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I beg your pardon?” said Barzilai, who thought
he was being rude.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Boulle,” repeated the old man. “Also spelled
B-u-h-l. The great French cabinetmaker. His style, you see, definitely. Mind
you, this isn’t <i>by</i> him. The period is too late for him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then who is it by?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Monsieur Levy was over eighty, with thin white
hair plastered on a wrinkled scalp, but he had pink apple cheeks and bright
eyes that sparkled with the pleasure of being alive. He had said <i>kaddish</i>
for so many of his own generation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, Boulle when he died handed over his
workshop to his protégé, the German Oeben. He in turn handed the tradition over
to another German, Riesener. I would think this is from the Riesener period.
Certainly by a pupil, perhaps by the master himself. Are you going to buy it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was teasing, of course. He knew the Mossad
did not buy works of art. His eyes danced with merriment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Let’s just say I am interested in it,” said
Barzilai.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Levy was delighted. They were up to their
naughty tricks again. He would never know what, but it was fun anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Do these desks—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Bureaux</i>,” said Levy, “it’s a <i>bureau</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“All right, do these <i>bureaux</i> ever have
secret compartments in them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Better and better—delightful! Oh, the
excitement!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Ah, you mean a <i>cachette</i>. Of course. You
know, young man, many years ago, when a man could be called out and killed in a
duel over a matter of honor, a lady having an affair had to be very discreet.
No telephones, then, no fax, no videos. All her lover’s naughty thoughts had to
be put on paper. Then where should she hide them from her husband?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not in a wall safe—there weren’t any. Nor an
iron box—her husband would demand the key. So the society people of those days
commissioned pieces of furniture with a <i>cachette</i>. Not all the time, but
sometimes. Had to be good workmanship, mind, or it would be too visible.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How would one know if a piece one was ...
thinking of buying had such a <i>cachette</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Oh, this was wonderful. The man from the Mossad
was not going to buy a Riesener <i>bureau</i>, he was going to break into one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Would you like to see one?” asked Levy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He made several phone calls, and at length they
left his shop and took a cab. It was another dealer. Levy had a whispered
conversation, and the man nodded and left them alone. Levy had said if he could
secure a sale, there’d be a small finder’s fee, nothing more. The dealer was
satisfied; it is often thus in the antique world.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The desk they examined was remarkably like the
one in Vienna.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now,” said Levy, “the <i>cachette</i> will not
be large, or it would be detectable in the measurements, external as opposed to
internal. So it will be slim, vertical or horizontal. Probably no more than two
centimeters thick, hiding in a panel that appears to be solid, three
centimeters thick, but is in fact two wafers of wood with the <i>cachette</i>
between them. The clue is the release knob.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He took out one of the top drawers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Feel in there,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Barzilai reached in until his fingertips
touched the back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Feel around.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Nothing,” said the <i>katsa</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s because there isn’t anything,” said
Levy. “Not in this one. But there might be a knob, a catch, or a button. A
smooth button, you press it; a knob, you turn it; a catch, move it from side to
side, and see what happens.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What should happen?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A low click, and a small piece of marquetry
pops out, spring-loaded. Behind that is the <i>cachette</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even the ingenuity of the cabinetmakers of the
eighteenth century had its limits. Within an hour, Monsieur Levy had taught the
<i>katsa</i> the basic ten places to look for the hidden catch that would
release the spring to open the compartment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Never try to use force to find one,” Levy
insisted. “You won’t anyway, with force, and besides, it leaves traces on the
woodwork.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He nudged Barzilai and grinned. Barzilai gave
the old man a good lunch at the Coupole, then took a taxi back to the airport
to return to Vienna.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Early that morning, February 16, Major Zayeed and his team
presented themselves at the first of the three villas that were to be searched.
The other two were sealed, with men posted at all the entrances and the
bewildered occupants confined inside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The major was perfectly polite, but his
authority brooked no objection. Unlike the AMAM team a mile and a half away in
Qadisiyah, Zayeed’s men were experts, caused very little permanent damage, and
were the more efficient for it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Beginning at the ground level, searching for
access to a hiding place beneath the floor tiles, they worked their way
steadily through the house, room by room, cupboard by cupboard, and cavity by
cavity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The garden was also searched, but not a trace
was found. Before midday, the major was satisfied at last, made his apologies
to the occupants, and left. Next door, he began to work through the second house.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the basement beneath the AMAM headquarters in Saadun,
the old man was on his back, strapped at his wrists and waist to a stout wooden
table and surrounded by the four experts who would extract his confession.
Apart from these, there was a doctor present, and Brigadier Omar Khatib
consulting in a corner with Sergeant Ali.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was the head of the AMAM who decided on the
menu of afflictions to be undertaken. Sergeant Ali raised an eyebrow; he would,
he realized, certainly need his coveralls this day. Omar Khatib nodded curtly
and left. He had paperwork to attend to in his upstairs office.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man continued to plead that he knew
nothing of any transmitter, that he had not been in the garden for days due to
the inclement weather. ... The interrogators were not interested. They bound
both ankles to a broom handle running across the insteps. Two of the four
raised the feet to the required position with the soles facing the room, while
Ali and his remaining colleague took down from the walls the heavy quirts of
electrical flex.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the bastinado began, the old man screamed,
as they all did, until the voice broke, then fainted. A bucket of icy water
from the corner, where a row of them were stacked, brought him around.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Occasionally, through the morning, the men
rested, easing the muscles of their arms, which had become tired with their endeavors.
While they rested, cups of brine were dashed against the pulpy feet. Then,
refreshed, they resumed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Between bouts of fainting, the old man
continued to protest that he could not even operate a radio transmitter and
there must have been some mistake.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By midmorning, the skin and meat of the soles
of both feet had been whipped away and the white bones glinted through the
blood. Sergeant Ali sighed and nodded that this process should cease. He lit a
cigarette and savored the smoke while his assistant used a short iron bar to
crack the leg bones from ankle to knees.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The old man pleaded with the doctor, as one
medical practitioner to another, but the AMAM physician stared at the ceiling.
He had his orders, which were to keep the prisoner alive and conscious.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Across the city, Major Zayeed finished his search of the
second villa at four o’clock, just as Gidi Barzilai and Michel Levy were rising
from their table in Paris. Again, he had found nothing. Making his courteous
apologies to the terrified couple who had watched their home being
systematically stripped, he left and with his rummage crew moved on to the
third and last villa.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In Saadun, the old man was fainting more frequently, and
the doctor protested to the interrogators that he needed time to recover. An
injection was prepared and pumped into the prisoner’s bloodstream. It had an
almost immediate effect, bringing him back from his near-coma to wakefulness
and rousing the nerves to fresh sensitivity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the needles in the brazier glowed
red-white, they were driven slowly through the shriveled scrotum and the
desiccated testicles within.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just after six the old man went into a coma
again, and this time the doctor was too late. He worked furiously, the sweat of
fear pouring down his face, but all his stimulants, injected directly into the
heart, failed to suffice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ali left the room and returned after five
minutes with Omar Khatib. The brigadier looked at the body, and years of
experience told him something for which he needed no medical degree. He turned,
and his open palm caught the cringing doctor a fearsome crack across the side
of the face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The force of the blow as much as the reputation
of the man who administered it sent the doctor crashing to the floor among his
syringes and vials.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Cretin,” hissed Khatib. “Get out of here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The doctor gathered his bits into his bag and
left on hands and knees. The Tormentor looked at Ali’s handiwork. There was the
sweet smell in the air both men knew of old, an admixture of sweat, terror,
urine, excrement, blood, vomit, and a faint aroma of burnt meat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He still protested to the end,” said Ali. “I
swear, if he knew something, we’d have had it out of him.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Put him in a bag,” snapped Omar Khatib, “and
return him to his wife for burial.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a strong white canvas sack six feet long
and two feet wide, and it was dumped on the doorstep of the house in Qadisiyah
at ten that evening. Slowly and with great difficulty, for both were old, the
widow and the house servant lifted the bag, brought it inside, and laid it on
the dining table. The woman took up her station at the end of the table and
began to keen her grief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The bewildered old servant, Talat, went to the
telephone, but it had been ripped from the wall and did not work. Taking his
mistress’s phone book, which he could not read, he went down the road to the
house of the pharmacist and asked the neighbor to try to contact the young
master—either of the young masters would do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the same hour, as the pharmacist tried to
get a call through Iraq’s wrecked internal telephone system, and Gidi Barzilai,
back in Vienna, composed a fresh cable to Kobi Dror, Major Zayeed was reporting
his day’s lack of progress to Hassan Rahmani.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It just wasn’t there,” he told the head of Counterintelligence.
“If it had been, we’d have found it. So it has to be the fourth villa, the home
of the diplomat.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re sure you can’t be wrong?” asked
Rahmani. “It couldn’t be in another house?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, sir. The nearest house to those four is
well outside the area indicated by the crossed beams. The source of those burst
transmissions was inside that diamond on the map. I’d swear to it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani was hesitant. Diplomats were the very
devil to investigate, always prepared to rush to the Foreign Ministry with a
complaint. To get inside Comrade Kulikov’s residence, he would have to go high—as
high as he could.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the major was gone, Rahmani phoned the
Foreign Ministry. He was in luck; the Foreign Minister, who had been traveling
almost constantly for months, was in Baghdad. More, he was still at his desk.
Rahmani secured his interview for ten the next morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The pharmacist was a kindly man, and he just kept trying
all through the night. He never did reach the older son, but using a contact in
the Army, he managed to get a message through to the younger of his dead friend’s
two boys. He could not speak to the man himself, but the Army contact passed it
on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The message reached the younger son at his base
far away from Baghdad at dawn. As soon as he heard it, the officer took his car
and began to drive. Normally it would have taken him no more than two hours.
That day, February 17, it took him six. There were patrols and roadblocks.
Using his rank, he could drive to the head of the line, flash his pass, and be
waved on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That did not work for the wrecked bridges. At
each one he had to wait for the ferry. It was midday when he arrived at his
parents’ house in Qadisiyah.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His mother ran into his embrace and cried
against his shoulder. He tried to extract from her details of precisely what
had happened, but she was no longer young herself and was hysterical.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, he picked her up and carried her to
her room. In the mess of medications the soldiers had left strewn all over the
bathroom floor, he found a bottle of sleeping pills his father had used when
winter cold brought on the arthritis. He gave his mother two, and soon she
slept.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the kitchen he ordered old Talat to make
them both a coffee, and they sat at the table while the servant described what
had happened since dawn of the previous day. When he was finished, he showed
his dead master’s son the hole in the garden where the soldiers had found the
bag with the radio set. The younger man shinnied lip the garden wall and found
the scratches where the intruder had come over in the night to bury it. Then he
went back to the house.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Hassan Rahmani was kept waiting, which he did not like,
but he had his appointment with the Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, just before
eleven.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t think I quite understand you,” said
the gray-haired minister, peering owlishly through his glasses. “Embassies are
allowed to communicate with their capitals by radio, and their transmissions
are always coded.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, Minister, and they come from the Chancery
building. That is part of normal diplomatic traffic. This is different. We are
talking here about a covert transmitter, as used by spies, sending burst
transmissions to a receiver we are sure is not in Moscow but much closer.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Burst transmissions?” asked Aziz.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani explained what they were.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I still fail to follow you. Why should some
agent of the KGB—and presumably this must be a KGB operation—be sending burst
messages from the residence of the First Secretary, when they have a perfect
right to send them on much more powerful transmitters from the embassy?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I do not know.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then you must offer me some kind of better
explanation. Brigadier. Have you any idea what is going on outside your own
office? Do you not know that late yesterday I arrived back from Moscow after
intensive discussions with Mr. Gorbachev and his representative Yevgeny
Primakov, who was here last week? Do you not know that I brought with me a
peace proposal that, if the Rais accepts it—and I am presenting it to him in
two hours—could cause the Soviet Union to recall the Security Council and
forbid the Americans to attack us?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And in the face of all this, at this precise
moment, you expect me to humiliate the Soviet Union by ordering a raid on their
First Secretary’s villa? Frankly, Brigadier, you must be mad.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That was the end of it. Hassan Rahmani left the
Ministry seething but helpless. There was one thing, however, that Tariq Aziz
had not forbidden. Within the walls of his house, Kulikov might be impregnable.
Inside his car he might be untouchable. But the streets did not belong to
Kulikov.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I want it surrounded,” Rahmani told his best
surveillance team, when he returned to his office. “Keep it quiet, discreet,
low-profile. But I want total surveillance of that building. When visitors come
and go—and there must be visitors—I want them tailed.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By noon, the watcher teams were in place. They
sat in parked cars beneath the trees covering all four walls of the Kulikov
compound and monitored both ends of the only street that led to it. Others,
farther away but linked by radio, would report on anyone approaching and follow
anyone who left.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The younger son sat in the dining room of his parents’
house and looked at the long canvas bag that contained his father. He let the
tears run down his face to make damp marks on the jacket of his uniform, and he
thought of the good days long ago. His father had been a prosperous doctor
then, with a large practice, even tending to the families of some of the
British community after being introduced to them by his friend Nigel Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He thought of the times he and his brother had
played in the Martins’ garden with Mike and Terry, and he wondered what had
ever happened to those two.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After an hour he noticed some stains on the
canvas that seemed to be larger than they had been. He rose and went to the
door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Talat.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Master?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bring scissors and a kitchen knife.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Alone in the room, Colonel Osman Badri cut open
the canvas bag, along the top, down one side and along the bottom. Then he
pulled the top of the sack away and rolled it back. His father’s body was still
quite naked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>According to tradition, it was supposed to be
woman’s work, but this was no task for his mother. He called for water and
bandages, bathed and cleaned the ravaged body, bound up the broken feet,
straightened and swaddled the shattered legs, and covered the blackened
genitalia. As he worked, he cried; and as he cried, he changed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At dusk he called the Imam at the Alwazia
cemetery in Risafa and made arrangements for a funeral the next morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin had in fact been into the city on his bicycle
that Sunday morning, February 17, but he had returned after buying his
groceries and checking the three walls for any chalk marks, arriving back at
the villa just before midday. During the afternoon he was kept busy tending the
garden. Mr. Kulikov, while neither Christian nor Moslem and celebrating neither
the Moslem holy day on Friday nor the Christian sabbath on Sunday, was at home
with a cold, complaining about the state of his roses.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While Martin worked over the flower beds, the
Mukhabarat watcher teams were quietly sliding into place beyond the wall. Jericho,
he reasoned, could not possibly have news in less than two days; Martin would
patrol his chalk marks again the following evening.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The burial of Dr. Badri took place at Alwazia
shortly after nine o’clock. The cemeteries of Baghdad were busy in those times,
and the Imam had much to do. Only a few days earlier, the Americans had bombed
a public air raid shelter, causing more than three hundred deaths. Feelings
were running high. Several mourners at another funeral close by asked the
silent colonel if his relative had died from American bombs. He replied shortly
that death had been by natural causes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In Moslem custom, burial takes place quickly,
with no long period of waiting between death and interment. And mere was no
wooden coffin in the manner of Christians; the body was wrapped in cloth. The
pharmacist came, supporting Mrs. Badri, and they left in a group when the brief
ceremony was over. Colonel Badri was barely yards from the gate of Alwazia when
he heard his name called. Standing a few yards away was a limousine with
blackened windows. One at the rear was half open. The voice called him again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Badri asked the pharmacist to take his
mother home to Qadisiyah; he would join them later. When they had gone, he
walked over to the car.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The voice said: “Please join me, Colonel. We
need to talk.” He opened the car door and peered inside. The sole occupant had
moved to the far side to make space. Badri thought he knew the face, but
vaguely. He had seen it somewhere. He climbed in and closed the door. The man
in the dark gray suit pressed a button, and the window rose, shutting out the
sounds from outside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You have just buried your father.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.” Who was this man? Why could he not place
the face?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It was foul, what was done to him. If I had
learned in time, I might have stopped it. I learned too late.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Osman Badri felt something like a punch in the
stomach. He realized to whom he was talking—a man who had been pointed out to
him at a military reception two years earlier. “I am going to say something to
you, Colonel, that, if you were to report it, would cause me to die more
terribly than your father.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was only one such thing, thought Badri.
Treason.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Once,” said the man quietly, “I loved the
Rais.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So did I,” said Badri.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But things change. He has gone mad. In his
madness he piles cruelty upon cruelty. He must be stopped. You know about the
Qa’ala, of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Badri was surprised again, this time by the
sudden change of subject.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Of course. I built it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Exactly. Do you know what now resides within
it?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The senior officer told him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He cannot be serious,” said Badri.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He is completely serious. He intends to use it
against the Americans. That may not be our concern. But do you know what
America will do in return? It will reply in kind. Not a brick here will stand
on brick, not a stone on stone. The Rais alone will survive. Do you want to be
part of this?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Badri thought of the body in the
cemetery, over which the sextons were even then still heaping the dry earth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Tell me about Qa’ala.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Americans will destroy it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You can get this information to them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Trust me, there are ways. The Qa’ala ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So Colonel Osman Badri, the young engineer who
had once wanted to design fine buildings to last for centuries, as his
ancestors had done, told the man called Jericho.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Grid reference.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Badri gave him that too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Go back to your post, Colonel. You will be
safe.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Badri left the car and walked away. His
stomach was heaving, turning and turning. Within a hundred yards he began to
ask himself, over and again: What have I done? Suddenly, he knew he had to talk
to his brother, that older brother who had always had the cooler head, the
wiser counsel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The man the Mossad team called the spotter arrived back in
Vienna that Monday, summoned from Tel Aviv. Once again he was a prestigious
lawyer from New York, with all the necessary identifying paperwork to prove it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Even though the real lawyer was no longer on
vacation, the chances that Gemütlich, who hated telephones and fax machines,
would telephone New York to check were regarded as minimal. It was a risk the
Mossad was prepared to take.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Once again the spotter installed himself at the
Sheraton and wrote a personal letter to Herr Gemütlich. He again apologized for
his unannounced arrival in the Austrian capital but explained he was
accompanied by his firm’s accountant, and that the pair of them wished to make
a first substantial deposit on behalf of their client.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The letter was delivered by hand in the late
afternoon, and the following morning Gemütlich’s reply arrived at the hotel,
offering a meeting at ten in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The spotter was indeed accompanied. The man
with him was known simply as the cracksman, for that was his speciality.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If the Mossad possesses at its Tel Aviv
headquarters a virtually unrivaled collection of dummy companies, false
passports, letterhead stationery, and all the other paraphernalia for
deception, pride of place must still go to its safecrackers and locksmiths. The
Mossad’s ability to break into locked places has its own niche in the covert
world. At the science of burglary, the Mossad has long been regarded simply as
the best. Had a neviot team been in charge at the Watergate, no one would ever
have known.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So high is the reputation of Israeli
lock-pickers that when British manufacturers sent a new product to the SIS for
their comments, Century House would pass it on to Tel Aviv. The Mossad, devious
to a fault, would study it, find how to pick it, then return it to London as “impregnable.”
The SIS found out about this.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The next time a British lock company came up
with a particularly brilliant new lock, Century House asked them to take it
back, keep it, but provide a slightly easier one for analysis. It was the
easier one that was sent to Tel Aviv. There it was studied and finally picked,
then returned to London as “unbreakable.” But it was the original lock that the
SIS advised the manufacturer to market.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This led to an embarrassing incident a year
later, when a Mossad locksmith spent three sweaty and infuriating hours working
at such a lock in the corridor of an office building in a European capital
before emerging livid with rage. Since then, the British have tested their own
locks and left the Mossad to work it out for themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The lock-picker brought from Tel Aviv was not
the best in Israel but the second best. There was a reason for this: He had
something the best lock-pick did not have.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During the night the young man underwent a
six-hour briefing from Gidi Barzilai on the subject of the eighteenth-century
work of the German-French cabinetmaker Riesener, and a full description by the
spotter of the internal layout of the Winkler building. The yarid, surveillance
team completed his education with a rundown of the movements of the nightwatch,
as observed by the times and places of lights going on and off inside the bank
during the night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That same Monday, Mike Martin waited until five
in the afternoon before he wheeled his bone-shaker bicycle across the graveled
yard to the rear gate of the Kulikov garden, opened the gate, and let himself
out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He mounted and began to ride down the road in
the direction of the nearest ferry crossing of the river, at the place where
the Jumhuriya Bridge used to be before the Tornados offered it their personal
attention.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He turned the corner, out of sight of the
villa, and saw the first parked car. Then the second, farther on. When the two
men emerged from the second car and took up position in the center of the road,
his stomach began to tighten. He risked a glance behind him; two men from the
other car had blocked any retreat. Knowing it was all over, he pedaled on.
There was nothing else to do. One of the men ahead of him pointed to the side
of the road.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hey you!” he shouted. “Over here!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He came to a stop under the trees by the side
of the road. Three more men emerged, soldiers. Their guns pointed straight at
him. Slowly he raised his hands.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942772">Chapter 21</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That afternoon in Riyadh, the British and American
ambassadors met, apparently informally, for the purpose of indulging in the
peculiarly English habit of taking tea and cakes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Also present on the lawn of the British embassy
were Chip Barber, supposedly on the U.S. embassy staff, and Steve Laing, who
would tell any casual inquirer that he was with his country’s Cultural Section.
A third guest, in a rare break from his duties belowground, was General Norman
Schwarzkopf.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Within a short time, all five men found
themselves together in a corner of the lawn, nursing their cups of tea. It made
life easier when everyone knew what everyone else really did for a living.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Among all the guests, the sole topic of talk
was the imminent war, but these five men had information denied to all the
rest. One piece of information was the news of the details of the peace plan
presented that day by Tariq Aziz to Saddam Hussein, the plan brought back from
Moscow and the talks with Mikhail Gorbachev. It was a subject of worry for each
of the five guests, but for different reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Schwarzkopf had already that day headed
off a suggestion out of Washington that he might attack earlier than planned.
The Soviet peace plan called for a declared cease-fire, and an Iraqi pullout
from Kuwait on the following day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Washington knew these details not from Baghdad
but from Moscow. The immediate reply from the White House was that the plan had
merits but failed to address key issues. It made no mention of Iraq’s annulment
forever of its claim on Kuwait; it did not bear in mind the unimaginable damage
done to Kuwait—the five hundred oil fires, the millions of tons of crude oil
gushing into the Gulf to poison its waters, the two hundred executed Kuwaitis,
the sacking of Kuwait City.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Colin Powell tells me,” said the general, “that
the State Department is pushing for an even harder line. They want to demand
unconditional surrender.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So they do, to be sure,” murmured the American
envoy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So I told ’em,” said the general, “I told ’em,
you need an Arabist to look at this.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Indeed,” replied the British ambassador, “and
why should that be?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Both the ambassadors were consummate diplomats
who had worked for years in the Middle East. Both <i>were</i> Arabists.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well,” said the Commander-in-Chief, “that kind
of ultimatum does not work with Arabs. They’ll die first.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was silence in the group. The ambassadors
searched the general’s guileless face for a hint of irony.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two intelligence officers stayed quiet, but
both men had the same thought in their minds: That is precisely the point, my
dear general.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“You have come from the house of the Russian.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a statement, not a question. The
Counterintelligence man was in plain clothes but clearly an officer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, <i>bey</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Papers.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin rummaged through the pockets of his <i>dish-dash</i>
and produced his ID card and the soiled and crumpled letter originally issued
to him by First Secretary Kulikov. The officer studied the card, glanced up to
compare the faces, and looked at the letter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Israeli forgers had done their work well.
The simple, stubbled face of Mahmoud Al-Khouri stared through the grubby
plastic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Search him,” said the officer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other plainclothesman ran his hands over
the body under the <i>dish-dash</i>, then shook his head. No weapons.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Pockets.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pockets revealed some dinar notes, some
coins, a penknife, different colored pieces of chalk, and a plastic bag. The
officer held up the last piece.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What is this?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The infidel threw it away. I use it for my
tobacco.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There is no tobacco in it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, <i>bey, </i>I have run out. I was hoping
to buy some in the market.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And don’t call me <i>bey</i>. That went out
with the Turks. Where do you come from, anyway?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin described the small village far in the
north. “It is well known thereabouts for its melons,” he added helpfully.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Be quiet about your thrice-damned melons!”
snapped the officer, who had the impression his soldiers were trying not to
smile.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A large limousine cruised into the far end of
the street and stopped, two hundred yards away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The junior officer nudged his superior and
nodded. The senior man turned, looked, and told Martin, “Wait here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He walked back to the large car and stooped to
address someone through the rear window.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Who have you got?” asked Hassan Rahmani.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Gardener-handyman, sir. Works there. Does the
roses and the gravel, shops for the cook.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Smart?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, sir, practically simpleminded. A peasant
from up-country, comes from some melon patch in the north.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Rahmani thought it over. If he detained the
fool, the Russians would wonder why their man had not come back. That would
alert them. He hoped that if the Russian peace initiative failed, he would get
his permission to raid the place. If he let the man complete his errands and
return, he might alert his Soviet employers. In Rahmani’s experience there was
one language every poor Iraqi spoke and spoke well. He produced a wallet and
peeled out a hundred dinars.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Give him this. Tell him to complete his
shopping and return. Then he is to keep his eyes open for someone with a big,
silver umbrella. If he keeps silent about us and reports tomorrow on what he
has seen, he will be well rewarded. If he tells the Russians, I will hand him
over to the AMAM.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, Brigadier.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The officer took the money, walked back, and
instructed the gardener as to what he had to do. The man looked puzzled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“An umbrella, <i>sayidi</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes, a big silver one, or maybe black,
pointing at the sky. Have you ever seen one?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No, <i>sayidi</i>,” said the man sadly. “Whenever
it rains they all run inside.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“By Allah the Great,” murmured the officer, “it’s
not for the rain, oaf! It’s for sending messages.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“An umbrella that sends messages,” repeated the
gardener slowly, “I will look for one, <i>sayidi</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Get on your way,” said the officer in despair.
“And stay silent about what you have seen here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin pedaled down the road, past the
limousine. As he approached, Rahmani lowered his head into the rear seat. No
need to let the peasant see the head of Counterintelligence for the Republic of
Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin found the chalk mark at seven and
recovered the message at nine. He read it by the light from the window of a café—not
electric light, for there was none anymore, but a gasoline lamp. When he saw
the text, he let out a low whistle, folded the paper small, and stuffed it
inside his underpants.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was no question of going back to the
villa. The transmitter was blown, and a further message would spell disaster.
He contemplated the bus station, but there were Army and AMAM patrols all over
it, looking for deserters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Instead, he went to the fruit market at Kasra
and found a truck driver heading west. The man was only going a few miles
beyond Habbaniyah, and twenty dinars persuaded him to take a passenger. Many
trucks preferred to drive by night, believing that the Sons of Dogs up there in
their airplanes could not see them in the dark, unaware that by either night or
day, battered fruit trucks were not General Chuck Horner’s top priority.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So they drove through the night, by headlights
generating at least one candlepower, and at dawn Martin found himself deposited
on the highway just west of Lake Habbaniyah, where the driver turned off for
the rich farms of the Upper Euphrates Valley.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had been stopped twice by patrols, but on
each occasion Martin had produced his papers and the Russian letter, explaining
that he had worked as gardener for the infidel, but they were going home and
had dismissed him. He whined about the way they had treated him until the
impatient soldiers told him to be quiet and get on his way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That night, Osman Badri was not far from Mike Martin,
heading in the same direction but ahead of him. His destination was the fighter
base where his elder brother, Abdelkarim, was the squadron commander.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During the 1980s a Belgian construction company
called Sixco had been contracted to build eight superprotected air bases to
house the cream of Iraq’s best fighters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The key to them was that almost everything was
buried underground—barracks, hangars, fuel stores, ammunition magazines,
workshops, briefing rooms, crew quarters, and the big diesel generators to
power the bases.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The only things visible aboveground were the
actual runways, three thousand meters long. But as these appeared to have no
buildings or hangars associated with them, the Allies thought they were
barebones airfields, as Al Kharz in Saudi Arabia had been before the Americans
moved in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A closer inspection on the ground would have
revealed one-meter-thick concrete blast doors set into downward-leading ramps
at the ends of the runways. Each base was in a square five kilometers by five,
the perimeter surrounded by barbed-wire fencing. But like Tarmiya, the Sixco
bases appeared inactive and were left alone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To operate out of them, the pilots would be
briefed underground, get into their cockpits, and start their engines there.
Only when they were fully run-up, with blast walls protecting the rest of the
base from their jet exhaust and diverting the gases upward to mingle with the
hot desert air outside, would the doors to the ramps be opened.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fighters could race up the ramps, emerge at
full power, afterburners on, scream down the runway, and be airborne in
seconds. Even when the AWACS spotted them, they appeared to have come from
nowhere and were assumed to be on low-level missions originating somewhere
else.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Abdelkarim Badri was stationed at one
of these Sixco bases, known only as KM 160 because it was off the
Baghdad-Ar-Rutba road, 160 kilometers west of Baghdad. His younger brother
presented himself at the guard post in the wire just after sundown.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because of his rank, a phone call was at once
made from the guard hut to the squadron commander’s private quarters, and soon
a jeep appeared, trundling across the empty desert, apparently having come from
nowhere.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A young Air Force lieutenant escorted the
visitor into the base, the jeep rolling down another hidden but small ramp into
the belowground complex, where the jeep was parked. The lieutenant led the way
down long concrete corridors, past caverns where mechanics worked on MiG 29s.
The air was clean and filtered, and everywhere was the hum of generators.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Eventually they entered the senior officers’
area, and the lieutenant knocked at a door. At a command from inside, he showed
Osman Badri into the CO’s apartment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim rose, and the brothers embraced. The
older man was thirty-seven, also a colonel and darkly handsome, with a slim
moustache. He was unmarried but never lacked for female attention. His looks,
his sardonic manner, his dashing uniform, and his pilot’s wings ensured it. Nor
was his appearance a sham; Air Force generals admitted he was the best fighter
pilot in the country, and the Russians, who had trained him on the ace of the
Soviet fighter fleet, the MiG 29 Fulcrum supersonic fighter, agreed with that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, my brother, what brings you out here?”
Abdelkarim asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Osman, when he had sat down and gotten coffee
from a freshly perked brew, had had time to study his older sibling. There were
lines of strain around the mouth that had not been there before, and weariness
in the eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim was neither a fool nor a coward. He
had flown eight missions against the Americans and the British. He had returned
from them all—just. He had seen his best colleagues shot down or blown apart by
Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles, and he had dodged four himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The odds, he had recognized after his first
attempt to intercept the American strike bombers, were impossible. On his own
side, he had neither information nor guidance as to where the enemy was, how
many, of what type, at what height, or on which heading. The Iraqi radars were
down, the control and command centers were in pieces, and the pilots were
simply on their own.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Worse, the Americans with their AWACS could
pick up the Iraqi warplanes before they had reached a thousand feet, telling
their own pilots where to go and what to do to secure the best attack position.
For the Iraqis, Abdelkarim Badri knew, every combat mission was a suicide
quest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Of all this, he said nothing, forcing a smile
and a request for his brother’s news. That news killed the smile.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Osman related the events of the past sixty
hours: the arrival of the AMAM troops at their parents’ house at dawn, the
search, the discovery in the garden, the beating of their mother and Talat, and
the arrest of their father. He told how he had been summoned when the
neighboring pharmacist finally got a message to him, and how he had driven home
to find their father’s body on the dining-room table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim’s mouth tightened to an angry line
when Osman revealed what he had discovered when he cut open the body bag, and
the way their father had been buried that morning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The older man leaned forward sharply when Osman
told how he had been intercepted as he left the cemetery, and of the
conversation that had taken place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You told him all that?” he asked, when his brother
had finished.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Is it true, all true? You really built this
Fortress, this Qa’ala?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And you told him where it is, so that he can
tell the Americans?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. Did I do wrong?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim thought for some while.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“How many men, in all Iraq, know about all
this, my brother?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Six,” said Osman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Name them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The Rais himself; Hussein Kamil, who provided
the finance and the manpower; Amer Saadi, who provided the technology. Then
General Ridha, who supplied the artillerymen, and General Musuli of the
Engineers—he proposed me for the job. And me, I built it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The helicopter pilots who bring in the
visitors?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They have to know the directions in order to
navigate, but not what is inside. And they are kept quarantined in a base
somewhere, I don’t know where.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Visitors—how many could know?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“None. They are blindfolded before takeoff and
until they have arrived.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If the Americans destroy this Qubth-ut-Allah,
who do you think the AMAM will suspect? The Rais, the ministers, the generals—or
you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Osman put his head in his hands.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What have I done?” he moaned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’m afraid, little brother, that you have
destroyed us all.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Both men knew the rules. For treason, the Rais
does not demand a single sacrifice but the extirpation of three generations:
father and uncles, so there will be no more of the tainted seed, brothers for
the same reason, and sons and nephews, so that none may grow up to carry on the
vendetta against him. Osman Badri began quietly to weep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim rose, pulled Osman to his feet, and
embraced him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You did right, brother. You did the right
thing. Now we must see how to get out of here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He checked his watch: eight o’clock.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“There are no telephone lines for the public
from here to Baghdad,” he said. “Only underground lines to the Defense people
in their various bunkers. But this message is not for them. How long would it
take you to drive to our mother’s house?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Three, maybe four hours,” said Osman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You have eight, to get there and back. Tell
our mother to pack all she values into our father’s car. She can drive it—not
well, but enough. She should take Talat and go to Talat’s village. She should
seek shelter with his tribe until one of us contacts her. Understood?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. I can be back by dawn. Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Before dawn. Tomorrow I am leading a flight of
MiGs across to Iran. Others have gone before. It is a crazy scheme by the Rais
to save his best fighter planes. Nonsense, of course, but it may save our
lives. You will come with me.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I thought the MiG 29 was a single-seater?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I have one trainer version with two seats. The
UB model. You will be dressed as an Air Force officer. With luck, we can get
away with it. Go now.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin was walking west that night along the Ar-Rutba
road when the car of Osman Badri flashed past him, heading toward Baghdad.
Neither took any notice of the other. Martin’s destination was the next river
crossing, fifteen miles ahead. There, with the bridge down, trucks would have
to wait for the ferry, and he would have a better chance of paying another
driver to take him farther west.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the small hours of the morning he found
exactly such a truck, but it could take him only to a point just beyond
Muhammadi. There he began to wait again. At three o’clock the car of Colonel
Badri sped back again. He did not hail it, and it did not stop. The driver was
clearly in a hurry. Just before dawn a third truck came along, pulled out of a
side road onto the main highway, and paused to take him aboard. Again he paid
the driver from his dwindling stock of dinar notes, grateful to whoever had
thought to give him the wad of money back in Mansour. By dawn, he assumed, the
Kulikov household would complain that they had lost their gardener.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A search of his shack would reveal the writing
pad beneath the mattress—an odd possession for an illiterate—and a further
search would reveal the transmitter beneath the tiles. By midday, the hunt
would be well up, starting in Baghdad but spreading across the country. By
nightfall, he needed to be far away in the desert, heading for the border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The truck in which he rode was beyond KM 160
when the flight of MiG 29s took off.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Osman Badri was terrified, being one of those
people with a deep loathing of flying. In the underground caverns that made up
the base, he had stood to one side as his brother briefed the four young pilots
who would form the rest of the flight. Most of Abdelkarim’s contemporaries were
dead; these were youngsters, more than a decade his junior, not long out of
training school. They listened with rapt attention to their squadron commander
and nodded their assent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Inside the MiG, even with the canopy closed,
Osman thought he had never heard a roar like it as, in the enclosed space, the
two RD 33 Soviet turbofans ran up to maximum dry power. Crouching in the rear
cockpit behind his brother, Osman saw the great blast doors open on their
hydraulic pistons and a square of pale blue sky appear at the end of the
cavern. The noise increased as the pilot ran his throttle through the gate and
into afterburn, and the twin-finned Soviet interceptor shuddered against her
brakes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the brakes came off, Osman thought he had
been kicked in the small of the back by a mule. The MiG leaped forward, the
concrete walls flashed past, and the jet took the ramp and emerged into the
dawn light.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Osman shut his eyes and prayed. The rumbling of
the wheels ceased, he seemed to be drifting, and he opened his eyes. They were
airborne, the lead MiG circling low over KM 160 as the other four jets screamed
out of the tunnel below. Then the doors closed, and the air base ceased to
exist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All around him, because the UB version is a
trainer, were dials and clocks, buttons, switches, screens, knobs, and levers.
Between his legs was a duplicate control column. His brother had told him to
leave everything alone, which he was glad to do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At one thousand feet the flight of five MiGs
formed into a staggered line, the four youngsters behind the squadron
commander. His brother set course just south of due east, keeping low, hoping
to avoid detection and to cross the southern outskirts of Baghdad, losing his
MiGs from prying American eyes in the clutter of industrial plants and other
radar images.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a high-risk gamble, trying to avoid the
radars of the AWACS out over the Gulf, but he had no choice. His orders were
formal, and now Abdelkarim Badri had an extra reason for wishing to reach Iran.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Luck was with him that morning, through one of
those flukes in warfare that are not supposed to occur but do. At the end of
every long shift on station over the Gulf, the AWACS had to return to base and
be replaced by another. It was called changing the cab rank. During the cab
rank changes, there was sometimes a brief window when radar cover was
suspended. The MiG flight’s low passage across South Baghdad and Salman Pak
coincided with just such a lucky break.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iraqi pilot hoped that by keeping to one
thousand feet, he could slip under any American flights, which tended to
operate at twenty thousand feet and up. He wanted to skirt the Iraqi town of Al
Kut to its north, then head straight for the safety of the Iranian border at
its nearest point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That morning, at that hour, Captain Don Walker of the
336th Tactical Fighter Squadron out of Al Kharz was leading a flight of four
Strike Eagles north toward Al Kut, his mission to bomb a major river bridge
over the Tigris across which Republican Guard tanks had been caught by a J-STAR
heading south for Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The 336th had spent much of its war on night
missions, but the bridge north of Al Kut would be a “quick fix,” meaning there
was no time to lose if Iraqi tanks were using it to head south. So the bombing
raid that morning had the coding “Jeremiah directs”: General Chuck Horner
wanted it done, and now.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Eagles were loaded with two-thousand-pound
laser-guided bombs and air-to-air missiles. Because of the positioning of the
bomb-attachment pylons beneath the wings of the Eagle, the load was asymmetric,
the bombs on one side being heavier than the Sparrow missiles on the other. It
was called the bastard load. Automatic trim control compensated for this, but
it was still not the load most pilots would choose to have hanging underneath
them in a dogfight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As the MiGs, now down to five hundred feet and
skimming the landscape, approached from the west, the Eagles were coming up
from the south, eighty miles away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first indication that Abdelkarim Badri had
of their presence was a low warbling in his ears. His brother behind him did
not know what it was, but the fighter pilots knew. The trainer MiG was in the
lead, the four juniors strung out behind him in a loose V formation. They all
heard it too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The warbling came from their RWR—radar warning
receiver. It meant there were other radars up there somewhere, sweeping the
sky.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four Eagles had their radars in the search
mode, the beams running out ahead of them to see what was there. The Soviet
radar warning receivers had picked up these beams and were telling their
pilots.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was nothing the MiGs could do but keep
going. At five hundred feet they were well below the Eagles and heading across
the Eagles’ projected track.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At sixty miles, the warbling in the Iraqi
pilots’ ears rose to a shrill bleep. That meant the RWRs were telling them:
Someone out there has gone out of search mode and is locked onto you.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Behind Don Walker, his wizzo Tim saw the change
in his radar’s attitude. From a gentle side-to-side scan, the American radars
had gone to lock-on, narrowing their beams and concentrating on what they had
found.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have five unidentifieds, ten o’clock low,”
the wizzo muttered, and engaged IFF. The other three wizzos in the flight did
the same.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Identification Friend or Foe is a sort of
transponder carried by all combat airplanes. It sends out a pulse on certain
frequencies, which are changed daily. Warplanes on the same side will receive
this pulse and reply: “I am a friend.” Enemy aircraft cannot do so. The five
blips on the radar screen crossing the track of the Eagles miles ahead and
close to the ground might have been five friendlies coming back from a mission—more
than likely, since there were far more Allied aircraft in the skies than
Iraqis.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Tim questioned the unidentifieds on modes one,
two, and four. No response.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hostiles,” he reported. Don Walker flicked his
missile switches to Radar, muttered, “Engage,” to his other three pilots,
dropped the nose, and headed down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim Badri was at a disadvantage, and he
knew it. He knew it from the moment the Americans locked onto him. He knew
without any IFF to tell him that these other aircraft could not possibly be
fellow Iraqis. He knew he had been spotted by hostiles, and he knew his young
colleagues would be no match for them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His disadvantage lay in the MiG he flew.
Because it was the trainer version, the only type with two seats, it was never
destined for combat. Colonel Badri’s radar had only a sixty-degree sweep out of
the nose. He could not see who had locked onto him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you have?” he barked at his wingman.
The reply was breathless and frightened.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Four hostiles, three o’clock high, diving
fast.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>So the gamble had failed. The Americans were
bucketing down the sky from the south, intent on blowing them all out of the
air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Scatter, dive, go to afterburner, head for
Iran!” he shouted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young pilots needed no second bidding. From
the jet pipes of each MiG a blast of flame leaped backward as the four throttles
went through the gate, punching the fighters through the sound barrier and
almost doubling their speed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Despite the huge increase in fuel consumption,
the single-seaters could keep their afterburners going long enough to evade the
Americans and still reach Iran. Their head start on the Eagles meant the
Americans would never catch them, even though they too would now be in
afterburn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim Badri had no such option. In making
their trainer version, the Soviet engineers had not only fitted a simpler
radar, but to accommodate the weight of the student and his cockpit, they had
considerably reduced the internal fuel capacity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fighter colonel was carrying underwing
long-range fuel tanks, but these would not be enough. He had four choices. It
took him no more than two seconds to work them out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He could go to afterburner, escape the
Americans, and return to an Iraqi base, there to be arrested and handed over
sooner or later to the AMAM for torture and death.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He could engage afterburner and continue for
Iran, evading the Americans but running out of fuel soon after crossing the
border. Even if he and his brother ejected safely, they would fall among the
Persian tribesmen who had suffered so horribly in the Iran-Iraq war from the
cargos dropped on them by Iraqi aviators.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He could use the afterburner to avoid the
Eagles, then fly south to eject over Saudi Arabia and become a prisoner. It
never occurred to him that he would be treated humanely.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were some lines that came into his head
from long ago, lines from a poem he had learned at Mr. Hartley’s school in that
Baghdad of his boyhood. Tennyson? Wordsworth? No, Macaulay, that was it,
Macaulay, something about a man in his last moments, something he had read out
in class.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in'>To every man upon this earth,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in'>Death cometh soon or late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in'>And how can a man die better</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in'>Than facing fearful odds,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in'>For the ashes of his fathers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in'>And the temples of his gods?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Badri pushed his throttle through the gate into
afterburner, hauled the MiG Fulcrum into a climbing turn, and went up to meet
the oncoming Americans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As soon as he turned, the four Eagles came into
his radar range. Two had scattered, racing down after the fleeing
single-seaters, all of them with afterburner engaged, all beyond the sound
barrier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the leader of the Americans was coming
straight down and at him. Badri felt the shudder as the Fulcrum went
supersonic, adjusted the control column a fraction, and went for the diving
Eagle ahead of him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Christ, he’s coming straight at us!” said Tim
from the rear seat. Walker did not need to be told. His own radar screen showed
him the four vanishing blips of the Iraqi aircraft fleeing for Iran and the
single glow of the enemy fighter climbing toward him to engage. The rangefinder
was unwinding like an alarm clock out of control. At thirty miles, they were
hurtling toward each other at a closing speed of 2,200 miles per hour. He still
could not see the Fulcrum visually, but it would not be long.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the MiG, Colonel Osman Badri was totally
bewildered. He had understood nothing of what had happened. The sudden thump of
the afterburner engaging had hit him in the small of the back again, and the
seven-G turn had caused him to black out for several seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What is happening?” he shouted into his mask,
but he was unaware that the mute button was on, so his brother could not hear
him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker’s thumb was poised over his missile
controls. He had two choices: the longer-range AIM-7 Sparrow, which was
radar-guided from the Eagle itself, or the shorter-range AIM-9 Sidewinder,
which was a heat-seeker.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At fifteen miles he could see it, the small
black dot racing up toward him. The twin fins showed it was a MiG 29 Fulcrum—arguably
one of the best interceptor fighters in the world in the right hands. Walker
did not know he faced the unarmed trainer version. What he did know was that it
might carry the AA-10 Soviet missile, with a range as long as his own AIM-7s.
That was why he chose the Sparrows.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At twelve miles he launched two Sparrows dead
ahead. The missiles flashed away, picking up the radar energy reflected from
the MiG and obediently heading straight toward it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Abdelkarim Badri saw the flashes as the
Sparrows left the Eagle, giving him a few more seconds of life unless he could
force the American to break off. He reached down to his left and pulled a
single lever.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker had often wondered what it would be
like, and now he knew. From the underside of the MiG’s wings came an answering
flicker of light. It was like a cold hand gripping his entrails, the icy,
freezing sensation of pure fear. Another man had launched two missiles at him.
He was staring certain death straight in the face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two seconds after he launched the Sparrows,
Walker wished he had chosen the Sidewinders. The reason was simple: The
Sidewinders were fire-and-forget missiles, they would find the target no matter
where the Eagle was. The Sparrows needed the Eagle to guide them; if he broke
away now, the missiles, without guidance, would “gimbal,” or wander off across
the sky to fall harmlessly to earth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was within a fraction of a second of
breaking off when he saw the missiles launched by the MiG tumble away toward
the ground. In disbelief he realized they were not rockets at all; the Iraqi
had tricked him by releasing his underwing fuel tanks. The aluminum canisters
had caught the morning sun as they fell, glittering like the ignited fuel of
launching missiles. It was a trick, and he, Don Walker, had damn nearly fallen
for it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the MiG Abdelkarim Badri realized the
American was not going to break off. He had tested the man’s nerve, and he had
lost. In the rear seat Osman had found the Transmit button. He could see by
looking over his shoulder that they were climbing, already miles above the
ground.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where are we going?” he screamed. The last
thing he heard was the voice of Abdelkarim, quite calm.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Peace, my brother. To greet our father.
Allah-o-Akhbar.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker watched the two Sparrows explode at that
moment, great peonies of red flame three miles away, then the broken fragments
of the Soviet fighter tumble down to the landscape below. He felt the sweat
trickling down his chest in rivulets.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His wingman, Randy Roberts, who had held his
position above and behind him, appeared off his right wingtip, the white-gloved
hand raised with the thumb erect. He replied in kind, and the other two Eagles,
having abandoned their fruitless chase of the remaining MiGs, swam up from
below to reform and went on to the bridge above Al Kut.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Such is the speed of events in fighter combat
that the entire action, from the first radar lock-on to the destruction of the
Fulcrum, had taken just thirty-eight seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The spotter was at the Winkler Bank on the dot of ten that
morning, accompanied by his “accountant.” The younger man bore a deep attaché
case containing one hundred thousand American dollars in cash.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The money was actually a temporary loan
arranged by the banking <i>sayan</i>, who was much relieved to be told that it
would simply be deposited with the Winkler Bank for a while, then retrieved and
returned to him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he saw the money, Herr Gemütlich was
delighted. He would have been less enthusiastic had he noticed that the dollars
occupied only half the thickness of the attaché case, and he would have been
horrified to see what lay beneath the false bottom.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For the sake of discretion, the accountant was
banished to Fräulein Hardenberg’s room while the lawyer and the banker arranged
the confidential operating codes for the new account. The accountant returned
to take charge of the receipt for the money and by eleven the matter was
concluded. Herr Gemütlich summoned the commissionaire to escort the visitors
back to the lobby and the front door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the way down the accountant whispered
something into the American lawyer’s ear, and the lawyer translated it to the
commissionaire. With a curt nod the commissionaire stopped the old
grille-fronted elevator at the mezzanine floor, and the three got out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The lawyer pointed out the door of the men’s
room to his colleague, and the accountant went in. The lawyer and the
commissionaire remained on the landing outside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At this point there came to their ears the
sounds of a fracas in the lobby, clearly audible because the lobby was twenty
feet along the corridor and down fifteen marble steps.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With a muttered excuse the commissionaire
strode along the corridor until he could see from the top of the stairs down to
the hallway. What he saw caused him to run down the marble steps to sort the
matter out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was an outrageous scene. Somehow three
rowdies, clearly drunk, had entered the lobby and were harassing the
receptionist for money for more liquid refreshment. She would later say they
had tricked her into opening the front door by claiming they were the postman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Full of indignation, the commissionaire sought
to bustle the hooligans outside. No one noticed that one of the rowdies, on
entering, had dropped a cigarette pack against the doorjamb so that, although
normally self-closing, the door would not quite shut.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Nor did anyone notice, in the jostling and
pushing, a fourth man enter the lobby on hands and knees. When he stood up, he
was at once joined by the lawyer from New York, who had followed the
commissionaire down the stairs to the lobby.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They stood to one side as the commissionaire
hustled the three rowdies back where they belonged—in the street. When he turned
around, the bank servant saw that the lawyer and the accountant had descended
from the mezzanine of their own accord. With profuse apologies for the unseemly
melee, he ushered them out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Once on the sidewalk, the accountant let out a
huge sigh of relief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I hope I never have to do that again,” he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Don’t worry,” said the lawyer. “You did pretty
well.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They spoke in Hebrew, because the accountant
knew no other language. He was in fact a bank teller from Beershe’eva, and the
only reason he was in Vienna, on his first and last covert assignment, was that
he also happened to he the identical twin of the cracksman, who was then
standing immobile in the darkness of the cleaning closet on the mezzanine
floor. There he would remain motionless for twelve hours.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin arrived in Ar-Rutba in the middle of the
afternoon. It had taken him twenty hours to cover a distance that normally
would take no more than six in a car.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the outskirts of the town he found a
herdsman with a flock of goats and left him somewhat mystified but quite happy
by buying four of them for his remaining handful of dinars at a price almost
twice what the herdsman would have secured at the market.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The goats seemed happy to be led off into the
desert, even though they now wore halters of cord. They could hardly be
expected to know that they were only there to explain why Mike Martin was
wandering around the desert south of the road in the afternoon sun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His problem was that he had no compass—it was
with the rest of his gear, beneath the tiles of a shack in Mansour. Using the
sun and his cheap watch, he worked out as best he could the bearing from the
radio tower in the town to the wadi where his motorcycle was buried.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a five-mile hike, slowed by the goats,
but they were worth having because twice he saw soldiers staring at him from
the road until he was out of sight. But the soldiers took no action.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He found the right wadi just before sundown,
identifying the marks scored into the nearby rocks, and he rested until the
light was gone before starting to dig. The happy goats wandered off.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was still there, wrapped in its plastic bag,
a rangy 125-cc. Yamaha cross-country motorcycle, all black, with panniers for
the extra fuel tanks. The buried compass was there, plus the handgun and
ammunition.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He strapped the automatic in its holster to his
right hip. From then on, there would be no more question of pretense; no Iraqi
peasant would be riding that machine in those parts. If he were intercepted, he
would have to shoot and escape.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He rode through the night, making far better
time than the Land-Rovers had been able to do. With the dirt bike he could
speed across the flat patches and drive the machine over the rocky ridges of
the wadis, using engine and feet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At midnight he refueled and drank water, with
some K rations from the packs left in the cache. Then he rode on due south for
the Saudi border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He never knew when he crossed the border. It
was all a featureless wasteland of rocks and sand, gravel and scree, and given
the zigzag course he had to cover, there was no way of knowing how many miles
he had covered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He expected to know he was in Saudi Arabia when
he came to the Tapline Road, the only highway in those parts. The land became
easier, and he was riding at twenty miles per hour when he saw the vehicle. Had
he not been so tired, he would have reacted faster, but he was half-drugged
with exhaustion and his reflexes were slow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The front wheel of the bike hit the tripwire,
and he was off, tumbling over and over until he came to rest on his back. When
he opened his eyes and looked up, there was a figure standing over him and the
glint of starlight on metal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Bouge pas, mec</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Not Arabic. He racked his tired mind. Something
a long time ago. Yes, Haileybury, some unfortunate schoolmaster trying to teach
him the intricacies of French.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Ne tirez pas</i>,” he said slowly. “<i>Je suis
Anglais</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There are only three British sergeants in the
French Foreign Legion, and one of them is called McCullin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Are you now?” he said in English. “Well, you’d
better get your arse over to the command vehicle. And I’ll have that pistol, if
you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Legion patrol was well west of its assigned
position in the Allied line, running a check on the Tapline Road for possible
Iraqi deserters. With Sergeant McCullin as interpreter, Martin explained to the
French lieutenant that he had been on a mission inside Iraq.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That was quite acceptable to the Legion:
Working behind the lines was one of their specialities. The good news was that
they had a radio.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The cracksman waited patiently in the darkness of the
broom closet through the Tuesday and into the night. He heard various male
employees enter the washroom, do what they came for, and leave. Through the
wall he could hear the elevator occasionally whine its way up and down to the
top floor. He sat on his briefcase with his back to the wall, and an occasional
glance at his luminous watch told him of the passing hours.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Between half past five and six he heard the
staff walking past on their way to the lobby and home. At six, he knew, the
nightwatchman would arrive, to be admitted by the commissionaire, who by then
would have checked every one of the staff past his desk according to the daily
list.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the commissionaire left just after six,
the nightwatch would lock the front door and set the alarms. Then he would
settle down with the portable TV he brought every evening and watch the game
shows until it was time for his first round.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>According to the yarid team, even the cleaners
were supervised. They did the common parts—halls, stairways, and washrooms—during
the nights of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but on a Tuesday night the
cracksman should remain undisturbed. On Saturdays they came back to clean the
private offices under the eye of the commissionaire, who remained with them at
all times.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The routine of the nightwatch was apparently
always the same. He made three tours of the building, testing all doors, at ten
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span>, at two in the morning, and at five.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Between coming on duty and his first tour, he
watched his TV and ate his packed supper. In the longest gap, between ten and
two, he dozed, setting a small alarm to tell him when it was two in the
morning. The cracksman intended to make his burglary during that gap.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had already seen Gemütlich’s office and its
all-important door. The latter was of solid wood but happily was not alarmed.
The window was alarmed, and he had noted the faint outline of two pressure pads
between the parquet and the carpet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At ten precisely he heard the elevator rumbling
upward, bearing the nightwatch to begin his tour of the office doors, starting
at the top and coming down floor by floor on foot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Half an hour later, the elderly man had
finished, put his head around the door of the men’s room, flashed on the light
to check the wired and alarmed window, closed the door, and returned to his
desk in the lobby. There he chose to watch a late game show.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At 10:45 the cracksman, in complete darkness,
left the men’s room and stole up the stairs to the fourth floor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The door of Herr Gemütlich’s office took him
fifteen minutes. The last tumbler of the four-lever mortise deadlock tumbled
back, and he stepped inside.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Although he wore a band around his head holding
a small penlight, he took another, larger flashlight to scan the room. By its
light, he could avoid the two pressure pads and approach the desk from its
unguarded side. Then he switched it off and resumed by the light only of the
penlight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The locks on the three top drawers were no
problem—small brass affairs over a hundred years old. When the three drawers
were removed, he inserted his hand and began to feel for a knob, button, or
lever. Nothing. It was an hour later, at the rear of the third drawer down on
the right-hand side, that he found it. A small lever, in brass, no more than an
inch long. When he pushed it, there was a low click, and a strip of inlay at
the base of the pillar jumped open a centimeter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The tray inside was quite shallow, less than an
inch, but it was enough to contain twenty-two sheets of thin paper. Each was a
replica of the letter of authority that alone would suffice to operate the
accounts under Gemütlich’s charge.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The cracksman produced his camera and a
clamper, a device of four fold-back aluminum legs that kept the prefocused
camera at exactly the right distance from the paper beneath it to get a
high-definition exposure.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The top of the pile of sheets was the one
describing the operating method of the account opened the previous morning by
the spotter, on behalf of the fictitious client in the United States. The one
he wanted was the seventh down. The number he already knew—the Mossad had been
paying money into Jericho’s account for two years before the Americans took
over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To be on the safe side, he photographed them
all anyway. After returning the <i>cachette</i> to its original state, he
replaced and relocked all the drawers and withdrew, sealing the office door
behind him. He was back in the broom closet by ten past one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the bank opened for morning business, the
cracksman let the elevator run up and down for half an hour, knowing the
commissionaire never needed to escort the staff to their offices. The first
client appeared at ten to ten. When the elevator had gone up past him, the
cracksman stole out of the men’s room, tiptoed to the end of the corridor, and
looked down into the lobby. The desk of the commissionaire was empty; he was
upstairs escorting the client.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The cracksman produced a bleeper and pressed
twice. Within three seconds the front door bell rang. The receptionist
activated her speaker system and asked:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Ja</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“<i>Lieferung</i>,” said a tinny voice. She
pressed the door-release catch, and a big cheerful delivery man entered the
lobby. He bore a large oil painting wrapped in brown paper and string.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Here you are, lady, all cleaned and ready to
rehang,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Behind him the door slid to its close. As it
did so, a hand came around the edge at floor level and inserted a wad of paper.
The door appeared to close but the catch did not engage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The delivery man stood the oil painting on the
edge of the receptionist’s desk. It was big, five feet wide and four feet tall.
It blocked her whole view of the lobby.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But I know nothing about—” she protested. The
head of the delivery man came around the edge of the painting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Just sign for its safe receipt, please,” he
said, and put in front of her a clipboard with a receipt form. As she studied
it, the cracksman came down the marble steps and slipped out of the door.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But this says Harzmann Galerie,” she pointed
out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s right. Ballgasse, number fourteen.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But we’re number eight. This is the Winkler
Bank. The gallery is farther up.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The puzzled delivery man made his apologies and
left. The commissionaire came back down the marble steps. She explained what
had happened. He snorted, resumed his seat across the lobby from the reception
desk, and returned to the morning paper.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>When the Blackhawk helicopter brought Mike Martin into the
Riyadh military air base at midday, there was a small and expectant committee
to meet him. Steve Laing was there, with Chip Barber. The man he had not expected
to see was his commanding officer, Colonel Bruce Craig. While Martin had been
in Baghdad, the deployment of the SAS in the western deserts of Iraq had grown
to involve two full squadrons out of Hereford’s four. One had remained at
Hereford as the standby squadron, the other was in smaller units on training
missions around the world.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You got it, Mike?” asked Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. Jericho’s last message. Couldn’t get it
out by radio.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He explained briefly why and handed over the
single grubby sheet of paper with Jericho’s report.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Man, we were worried when we couldn’t get you
these past forty-eight hours,” said Barber. “You’ve done a great job, Major.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Just one thing, gentlemen,” said Colonel
Craig. “If you have finished with him, can I have my officer back?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Laing was studying the paper, deciphering the
Arabic as best he could. He looked up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Why yes, I suppose so. With our sincere
thanks.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Wait a minute,” said Barber. “What are you
going to do with him now, Colonel?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, a bunk in our base across the airfield,
some food—”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Got a better idea,” said Barber. “Major, how
does a Kansas steak and fries, an hour in a marble bathtub, and a big soft bed
grab you?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“By the balls,” laughed Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Right. Colonel, your man gets a suite at the
Hyatt down the road for twenty-four hours, courtesy of my people. Agreed?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay. See you this time tomorrow, Mike,” said
Craig.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the short drive to the hotel opposite CENTAF
headquarters, Martin gave Laing and Barber a translation of the Jericho
message. Laing made verbatim notes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s it,” said Barber. “The air boys will go
in there and blow it away.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It required Chip Barber to check the soiled
Iraqi peasant into the best suite in the Hyatt, and when he was settled, Barber
left to cross the road to the Black Hole.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had his hour in the deep, steaming bath
and used the complimentary gear to shave and shampoo, and when he came out, the
steak and fries were on a tray in the sitting room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was halfway through the meal when sleep
overtook him. He just managed to make the wide soft bed next door, then he was
asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While he slept, a number of things happened.
Freshly pressed shorts, trousers, socks, shoes, and shirt were delivered to his
sitting room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In Vienna, Gidi Barzilai sent the operational
details of the Jericho numbered account to Tel Aviv, where an identical replica
was prepared with the appropriate wording.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Karim met Edith Hardenberg when she left the
bank after work, took her for a coffee, and explained that he had to return to
Jordan for a week to visit his mother, who was sick. She accepted his reason,
held his hand, and told him to hurry back to her as soon as he could.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Orders went out from the Black Hole to the air
base at Taif where a TR-1 spy plane was preparing to take off for a mission to
the far north of Iraq, to take further pictures of a major weapons complex at
As-Sharqat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The mission was given a new task with fresh map
coordinates, specifically to visit and photograph an area of a range of hills
in the northern sector of the Jebal al Hamreen. When the squadron commander
protested the sudden change, he was told the orders were classified as “Jeremiah
directs.” The protest ended.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The TR-1 took off just after two, and by four,
its images were appearing on the screens inside the designated conference room
down the corridor from the Black Hole.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was cloud and rain over the Jebal that
day, but with its infrared and thermal imaging radar, the ASARS-2 device that
defies cloud, rain, hail, sleet, snow, and darkness, the spy plane got its
pictures anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They were studied as they arrived by Colonel
Beatty of the USAF and Squadron Leader Peck of the RAF, the two top
photoreconnaissance analysts in the Black Hole.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The planning conference began at six. There
were only eight men present. In the chair was General Horner’s deputy, the
equally decisive but more jovial General Buster Glosson. The two intelligence
officers, Steve Laing and Chip Barber, were there because it was they who had
brought the target and knew the background to its revelation. The two analysts,
Beatty and Peck, were required to explain their interpretation of the pictures
of the area. And there were three staff officers, two American and one British,
who would note what had to be done and ensure that it was.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty opened with what was to become
the leitmotif of the conference.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have a problem here,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Then explain it,” said the general.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sir, the information provided gives us a grid
reference. Twelve figures, six of longitude and six of latitude. But it is not
a SATNAV reference, pinning the area down to a few square yards. We are talking
about one square kilometer. To be on the safe side, we enlarged the area to one
square mile.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And there it is.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty gestured to the wall. Almost the
entire space was covered by a blown-up photograph, high-definition,
computer-enhanced, and covering six feet by six. Everyone stared at it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t see anything,” said the general. “Just
mountains.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That, sir, is the problem. It isn’t there.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The attention switched to the spooks. It was,
after all, their intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What,” said the general slowly, “is supposed
to be there?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A gun,” said Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A gun?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The so-called Babylon gun.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I thought you guys had intercepted all of them
at the manufacturing stage.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So did we. Apparently one got through.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We’ve been through this before. It’s supposed
to be a rocket, or a secret fight-bomber base. No gun can fire a payload that
big.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“This one can, sir. I’ve checked with London. A
barrel over one hundred and eighty meters long, a bore of one meter. A payload
of over half a ton. A range of up to a thousand kilometers, according to the
propellant used.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And the range from here to the Triangle?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Four hundred and seventy miles, or 750
kilometers. General, can your fighters intercept a shell?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Patriot missiles?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Possibly, if they’re in the right place at the
right time and can spot it in time. Probably not.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The point is,” interjected Colonel Beatty, “gun
or missile, it’s not there.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Buried underground, like the Al Qubai assembly
factory?” suggested Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That was disguised with a car junkyard on top,”
said Squadron Leader Peck. “Here there’s nothing. No road, no tracks, no power
lines, no defenses, no helipad, no razor wire, no guard barracks—just a
wilderness of hills and low mountains with valleys between.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Supposing,” said Laing defensively, “they used
the same trick as at Tarmiya—putting the defense perimeter so far out, it was
off the frame?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We tried that,” said Beatty. “We looked fifty
miles out in all directions. Nothing—no defenses.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Just a pure deception operation?” proposed
Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“No way. The Iraqis <i>always</i> defend their
prize assets, even from their own people. Look—see here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty advanced to the picture and
pointed out a group of huts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“A peasant village, right next door. Woodsmoke,
goat pens, goats here out foraging in the valley. There are two others off the
frame.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Maybe they hollowed out the whole mountain,”
said Laing. “You did, at Cheyenne Mountain.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s a series of caverns, tunnels, a warren
of rooms behind reinforced doors,” said Beatty. “You’re talking about a barrel
180 meters long. Try to get that inside a mountain, you’d bring the whole damn
thing down on top. Look, gentlemen, I can see the breech, the magazine, all the
living quarters being underground, but a chunk of that barrel has to stick out
somewhere. It doesn’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They all stared at the picture again. Within
the square were three hills and a portion of a fourth. The largest of the three
was unmarked by any blastproof doors or access road.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If it’s in there somewhere,” proposed Peck, “why
not saturate-bomb the square mile? That would bring down any mountain on top of
the weapon.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Good idea,” said Beatty. “General, we could
use the Buffs. Paste the whole square mile.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“May I make a suggestion?” asked Barber.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Please do,” said General Glosson.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“If I were Saddam Hussein, with his paranoia,
and I had one single weapon of this value, I’d have a man in command I could
trust. And I’d give him orders that if ever the Fortress came under bombing attack,
he was to fire. In short, if the first couple of bombs fell wide—and a square
mile is quite a big area—the rest might be a fraction of a second too late.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Glosson leaned forward.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What is your precise point, Mr. Barber?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“General, if the Fist of God is inside these
hills, it is hidden by a deception operation of extreme skill. The only way to
be a hundred percent certain of destroying it is by a similar operation. A
single plane, coming out of nowhere, delivering one attack, and hitting the target
on the button the first and only time.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I don’t know how many times I have to say
this,” said the exasperated Colonel Beatty, “but we don’t know where the button
is—precisely.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I think my colleague is talking about
target-marking,” said Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But that means another airplane,” objected
Peck. “Like the Buccaneers marking for the Tornados. Even the target-marker
must see the target first.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It worked with the Scuds,” said Laing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sure, the SAS men marked the missile
launchers, and we blew them away. But they were right there on the ground, a
thousand yards from the missiles with binoculars,” said Peck.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Precisely.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There was silence for several seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You are talking,” said General Glosson, “of
putting men into the mountains to give us a ten-square-yard target.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The debate went on for two more hours. But it
always came back to Laing’s argument.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>First find it, then mark it, then, destroy it—and
all without the Iraqis noticing until it was too late.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At midnight a corporal of the Royal Air Force
went to the Hyatt Hotel. He could get no reply from the sitting-room door, so
the night manager let him in. He went into the bedroom and shook by the
shoulder the man sleeping in a terrycloth robe on top of the bed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sir, wake up, sir. You’re wanted across the road,
Major.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>“It’s there,” said Mike Martin two hours later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Where?” asked Colonel Beatty with genuine
curiosity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“In there somewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the conference room down the corridor from
the Black Hole, Martin was leaning over the table studying a photograph of a
larger section of the Jebal al Hamreen range. It showed a square five miles by
five miles. He pointed with his forefinger.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The villages, the three villages—here, here,
and here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What about them?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“They’re phony. They’re beautifully done, they’re
perfect replicas of the villages of mountain peasants, but they’re full of
guards.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Beatty stared at the three villages.
One was in a valley only half a mile from the middle of the three mountains at
the center of the frame. The other two occupied terraces on the mountain slopes
farther out.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>None was big enough to support a mosque;
indeed, they were little more than hamlets. Each had its main and central barn
for the storage of winter hay and feed, and smaller barns for the sheep and
goats. A dozen humble shacks made up the rest of the settlements, mud-brick
dwellings with thatch or tin roofs of the kind that can be seen anywhere in the
mountains of the Middle East. In summer there might be small patches of tilled
crops nearby, but not in winter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Life in the mountains of Iraq is harsh in
winter, with slanting bitter rain and scudding clouds. The notion that all
parts of the Middle East are warm is a popular fallacy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Okay, Major, you know Iraq, I don’t. Why are
they phony?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Life-support system,” said Martin. “Too many
villages, too many peasants, too many goats and sheep. Not enough forage. They’d
starve.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Shit,” said Beatty with feeling. “So damn
simple.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That may be, but it proves Jericho wasn’t
lying, or mistaken again. If they’ve done that, they’re hiding something.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Craig, commanding officer of the 22nd
SAS, had joined them in the basement. He had been talking quietly to Steve
Laing. Now he came over.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“What do you reckon, Mike?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s there, Bruce. One could probably see it—at
a thousand yards with good binoculars.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“The brass wants to put a team in to mark it.
You’re out.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bullshit, sir. These hills are probably alive
with foot patrols. You can see there are no roads.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“So? Patrols can be avoided.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“And if you run into any? There’s no one speaks
Arabic like me, and you know it. Besides, it’s a HALO drop. Helicopters won’t
work either.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’ve had all the action you need, so far as
I can gather.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That’s crap, too. I haven’t seen any action at
all. I’m fed up with spooking. Let me have this one. The others have had the
desert for weeks, while I’ve been tending a garden.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Craig raised an eyebrow. He had not
asked Laing exactly what Martin had been up to—he would not have been told
anyway—but he was surprised one of his best officers had been posing as a
gardener.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Come back to the base. We can plan better
there. If I like your idea, you can have it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Before dawn, General Schwarzkopf had agreed
there was no alternative and given his consent. In that cordoned-off corner of
the Riyadh military air base that was the private preserve of the SAS, Martin
had outlined his ideas to Colonel Craig and had been given the go-ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Coordination of planning would reside with
Colonel Craig for the men on the ground and with General Glosson for the
eventual fighter-strike.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Buster Glosson had morning coffee with his
friend and superior Chuck Horner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Any ideas for the unit we’d like to use on
this one?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>General Horner thought back to a certain
officer who two weeks earlier had advised him to do something extremely rude.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yeah,” he said. “Give it to the Three
Thirty-sixth.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mike Martin had won his argument with Colonel Craig by
pointing out—logically—that with most of the SAS soldiers in the Gulf Theater
already deployed inside Iraq, he was the senior officer available, that he was
commander of B Squadron, which was then on operations in the desert under the
command of his number two, and that he alone spoke fluent Arabic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the clinching argument was his training and
experience in freefall parachuting. The only way into the Iraqi mountains
without raising an alarm was going to be a HALO drop—high altitude, low opening—meaning
coming out of the aircraft at 25,000 feet and falling free to open the chutes
at 3,500 feet. It was not a job for beginners.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The planning of the entire mission ought to
have taken a week, but there was no time for that. The only solution was for
the various aspects of the drop, the cross-country march, and the selection of
the lying-up position to be planned simultaneously. For that, Martin needed men
he could trust with his life, which was precisely what he was going to do
anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Back at the SAS corner of the Riyadh military
air base, his first question to Colonel Craig was:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Who can I have?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The list was short; there were so many away on
operations in the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the adjutant showed him the list, one name
sprang out at him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Peter Stephenson—definite.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“You’re lucky,” said Craig. “He came back over
the border a week ago. Been resting ever since. He’s fit.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had known Sergeant Stephenson when the
sergeant had been a corporal and he a captain on his first tour with the
regiment as a troop commander. Like himself, Stephenson was a freefaller and a
member of the air troop of his own squadron.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“He’s good,” said Craig, pointing to another
name. “A mountain man. I suggest you’ll need two of them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The name he pointed to was Corporal Ben
Eastman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I know him. You’re right—I’ll take him
anytime. Who else?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The last selection was Corporal Kevin North,
from another squadron. Martin had never operated with him, but North was a
mountain specialist and highly recommended by his troop commander.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were five areas of planning that had to
be accomplished simultaneously. Martin divided up the tasks among them with himself
in charge overall.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>First came the selection of the aircraft to
drop them. Without hesitation, Martin went for the C-130 Hercules, the habitual
launch pad of the SAS, and there were then nine of them serving in the Gulf.
They were all based at nearby King Khaled International Airport. Even better
news came with breakfast: Three of them were from the 47th Squadron, based at
Lyneham in Wiltshire, a squadron that has years of experience liaising with the
SAS freefallers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Among the crew of one of the three Hercules was
a certain Flight Lieutenant Glyn Morris.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Throughout the Gulf War, the Hercules
transports had been part of the hub-and-spoke operation, shifting cargo that
arrived at Riyadh to the outlying bases of the Royal Air Force at Tabuq,
Muharraq, Dhahran, and even Seeb in Oman. Morris had been serving as loadmaster
or cargo supervisor, but his real function on this planet was as a PJI,
Parachute Jump Instructor, and Martin had jumped under his supervision before.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Contrary to the notion that the Paras and the
SAS look after their own parachuting, all combat dropping in the British Armed
Forces comes under the RAF, and the relationship is based on the mutual trust
that each party knows exactly what it is doing. Air Commodore Ian Macfadyen,
commanding the RAF in the Gulf, seconded the desired Hercules to the SAS
mission the moment it arrived back from stores-dumping at Tabuq, and riggers
began to convert it for the HALO mission scheduled for the same night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Chief among the conversion tasks was the
construction of an oxygen console on the floor of the cargo bay. Flying mainly
at low levels, the Hercules had till that point never needed oxygen in the rear
to keep troops alive at high altitude. Flight Lieutenant Morris needed no
training in what he was doing, and he brought in a second PJI from another
Hercules, Flight Sergeant Sammy Dawlish. They worked throughout the day on the
Hercules and had it ready by sundown.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second priority was the parachutes
themselves. At that point, the SAS had not dropped into Iraq from the skies—they
had gone into the Iraqi deserts on wheels—but in the weeks preceding the actual
war, training missions had been constant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the military air base there was a sealed and
temperature-controlled safety equipment section, where the SAS had stored its
parachutes. Martin asked for and got an allocation of eight main chutes and
eight reserves, although he and his men would only need four of each. Sergeant
Stephenson was allocated the task of checking and packing all eight throughout
the day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The chutes were no longer the circular type
associated with the airborne units, but the newer design called “squares.” They
are not really square but oblong and have two layers of fabric. In flight, air
is ducted between the layers, forming a semirigid “wing” with an airfoil
cross-section, enabling the freefaller to “fly” the chute down like a glider,
with greater mobility to turn and maneuver. These are the type normally seen at
freefalling displays.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two corporals got the task of obtaining and
checking all the remaining stores that would be needed. These included four
sets of clothing, four big Bergen rucksacks, water bottles, helmets, belts,
weapons, HVCs—the high-value concentrates, which would be all there was to eat—ammunition,
first-aid kits ... the list went on and on. Each man would be carrying eighty
pounds in those Bergens and might need every ounce of them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Fitters and mechanics worked on the Hercules
itself in a designated hangar, overhauling the engines and servicing every
moving part.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The squadron commander nominated his best
aircrew, whose navigator accompanied Colonel Craig back to the Black Hole to
select a suitable drop zone, the all-important DZ.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin himself was taken in hand by six
technicians, four American and two British, and introduced to the gizmos he
would have to operate to find the target, locate it to within a few square
yards, and relay the information back to Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he had finished, his various devices were
security-packed against accidental breakage and taken across to the hangar,
where the mountain of gear for the four men grew and grew. For extra safety,
there were two of each of the scientific devices, adding again to the weight
the men would carry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin himself went to join the planners in the
Black Hole. They were bent over a large table strewn with fresh pictures taken
by another TR-1 that morning just after dawn. The weather had been clear, and
the photos showed every nook and crevice of the Jebal al Hamreen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We assume,” said Colonel Craig, “that this damn
gun must be pointing south to southeast. The best observation point would
therefore seem to be here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He indicated a series of crevices in the side
of a mountain to the south of the presumed Fortress, the hill in the center of
the group within the square kilometer that had been designated by the late
Colonel Osman Badri.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“As for a DZ, there’s a small valley here,
about forty kilometers south. ... You can see the water glinting in a wee
stream running down the valley.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin looked. It was a tiny depression in the
hills, 500 yards long and about 100 wide, with grassy banks strewn with rocks,
and the rill trickling its winter water along the bottom of the dip.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s the best?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Colonel Craig shrugged. “Frankly, it’s about
all you’ve got. The next is seventy kilometers from the target. Get any closer,
and they could see you land.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the map, in daylight, it would be a cinch;
in pitch darkness, plunging through freezing air at 120 miles per hour, it
would be easy to miss. There would be no lights to guide them, no flares on the
ground. From blackness into blackness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I’ll take it,” he said. The RAF navigator
straightened up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Right, I’ll get going.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The navigator would have a busy afternoon. It
would be his job to find the way without lights and across a moonless sky not
to the drop zone but to a point in space from which, bearing in mind wind
drift, four falling bodies could leave his aircraft to find that tiny valley.
Even falling bodies drift downwind; his job would be to estimate how much.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not until the hour of dusk that all the
men met again in the hangar, now banned to everyone else on the base. The
Hercules stood ready, fueled. Beneath one wing was the mound of gear the four
men would need. Dawlish, the RAF jump instructor, had repacked every one of the
eight forty-eight-pound chutes as if he would be using them himself. Stephenson
was satisfied.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In one corner was a large briefing table.
Martin, who had brought enlarged photographs from the Black Hole with him, took
Stephenson, Eastman, and North over to the table to work out their route from
the DZ to those crevices where they intended to hole up and study the Fortress
for however long it took. It looked like two nights of hard march, resting in
place in the intervening day. There could be no question of marching in
daylight, and the route could not be direct.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally each man packed his Bergen from the
bottom up, the last item being the belt order, a heavy webbing belt with
numerous pockets that would be unpacked after landing and worn round the waist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>American hamburgers and sodas were brought from
the commissary at sundown, and the four men rested until takeoff. This was
scheduled for 9:45, aiming for a drop at 11:30 <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin always thought the waiting was worst;
after the frantic activity of the day, it was like a long anticlimax. There was
nothing to concentrate on but the tension, the constant nagging thought that,
despite all the checks and double-checks, something vital had been forgotten.
It was the period when some men ate, or read, or wrote home, or dozed, or just
went to the lavatory and emptied themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At nine a tractor towed the Hercules out onto
the apron, and the crew of pilot, copilot, navigator, and flight engineer began
their engine run-up checks. Twenty minutes later, a black-windowed bus entered
the hangar to take the men and their gear to the drop plane, waiting with rear
doors open and ramp down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two PJIs were ready for them, with the
loadmaster and chute rigger. Only seven walked up the ramp on foot and into the
vast cavern of the Here. The ramp came up, and the doors closed. The rigger had
gone back to the bus; he would not fly with them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With the PJIs and the loadmaster, the four
soldiers strapped themselves to the seats along the wall and waited. At 9:44 <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> the Hercules lifted off from Riyadh and
turned her blunt nose to the north.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>While the RAF plane rose into the night sky on
February 21, an American helicopter was asked to stay to one side before coming
in to settle close to the American sector of the air base.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It had been sent to Al Kharz to pick up two
men. Steve Turner, the squadron commander of the 336th Tactical Fighter
Squadron, had been summoned to Riyadh on the orders of General Buster Glosson.
With him, as ordered, he brought the man he considered his best pilot for
low-level ground-attack sorties.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Neither the CO of the Rocketeers nor Captain
Don Walker had the faintest idea why they were wanted. In a small briefing room
below CENTAF headquarters an hour later, they were told why, and what was
needed. They were also told that no one else, with the sole exception of Walker’s
weapons systems officer, the man flying in the seat behind him, was allowed to
know the full details.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then they were helicoptered back to their base.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>After takeoff the four soldiers could unbuckle and move
around the hull of the aircraft by the dim red lights overhead. Martin went
forward, up the ladder to the flight deck, and sat for a while with the crew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They flew at 10,000 feet toward the Iraqi
border, then began to climb. At 25,000 feet the Hercules leveled off and
crossed into Iraq, seemingly alone in the starlit sky.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In fact it was not alone. Over the Gulf an
AWACS had orders to keep a constant eye on the sky around and below them. If
any Iraqi radar screen, for some unknown reason not already totaled by the
Allied air forces, chose to “illuminate,” it was to be immediately attacked. To
this end, two flights of Wild Weasels with antiradar HARM missiles were below
them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In case some Iraqi fighter pilot chose to take
to the sky that night, a flight of RAF Jaguars was above and to the left of
them, a flight of F-15C Eagles to the right. The Hercules was flying in a
protective box of lethal technology. No other pilot in the sky that night knew
why. They just had their orders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In fact, if anyone in Iraq saw any blip on the
radar that night, it was assumed the cargo plane was just heading north to
Turkey.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The loadmaster did his all to make his guests
comfortable with tea, coffee, soft drinks, and crackers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Forty minutes before Release Point, the
navigator flashed a warning light indicating P-minus-forty, and the last
preparations began.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four soldiers put on their main and reserve
parachutes, the former across the breadth of the shoulders, the latter lower
down the back. Then came the Bergens, hung upside down on the back beneath the
chutes, with the point between the legs. Weapons—a silenced Heckler and Koch
MP5 SD submachine gun—were clipped down the left side, and the personal oxygen
tank hooked across the belly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally they put on their helmets and oxygen
masks before connecting the latter to the center console, a frame structure the
size of a large dining table crammed with bottles of oxygen. When everyone was
breathing and comfortable, the pilot was informed and began to bleed the air
and pressure level inside the hull out into the night until both had equalized.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took almost twenty minutes. Then they sat
again, waiting. Fifteen minutes before Release Point, a further message came
from the flight deck into the ears of the loadmaster. He told the PJIs to
gesture to the soldiers to switch from main console oxygen to their own
personal minibottles. Each of these had a thirty-minute supply, and they would
need three to four minutes of that for the drop itself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At that point only the navigator on the flight
deck knew exactly where he was; the SAS team had total confidence that they
would be dropped in the right place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By now the loadmaster was in contact with the
soldiers by a constant stream of hand signals, which ended when he pointed both
hands at the lights above the console. Into the loadmaster’s ears came a stream
of instructions from the navigator.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The men rose and started to move, slowly, like
spacemen weighed down by their gear, toward the ramp. The PJIs, also on mobile
oxygen bottles, went with them. The SAS men stood in a line in front of the
still-closed tailgate door, each checking the equipment in front of him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At P-minus-four the tailgate came down, and
they stared out into 25,000 feet of rushing black air. Another hand signal—two
fingers raised by the PJI—told them they were at P-minus-two. The men shuffled
to the very edge of the ramp and looked at the lights (unilluminated) on each
side of the gaping aperture. The lights went red, goggles were drawn down. The
lights went green. ...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>All four men turned on one heel, facing into
the cavern, and jumped backward, arms apart, faces down. The sill of the ramp
flashed beneath their masks, and the Hercules was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sergeant Stephenson led the way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Stabilizing their fall position, they dropped
through the night sky for five miles without a sound. At 3,500 feet automatic
pressure-operated releases jerked open the parachute packs, and the fabric
exploded out. In second position, Mike Martin saw the shadow fifty feet beneath
him appear to stop moving. In the same second he felt the vibration of his own
main chute opening, then the “square” took the strain and he slowed from 120
miles per hour to fourteen, with hesitators taking up some of the shock.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At one thousand feet each man undid the
snap-locks that held his Bergen to his backside and cinched the load down his
legs, there to hook onto his feet. The Bergens would remain there all the way
down, being released only a hundred feet above the ground, to hang at the full
extent of the fourteen-foot nylon retaining line.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sergeant’s parachute was moving away to
Martin’s right, so he followed. The sky was clear, the stars visible, black
shapes of mountains rushed upward on all sides. Then Martin saw what the
sergeant had seen: the glitter of water in the stream running through the
valley.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Peter Stephenson went down right in the center
of the zone, a few yards from the edge of the stream, on soft grass and moss.
Martin dropped his Bergen on its line, swerved, stopped in the air, felt the
Bergen hit the ground beneath him, and settled gently onto both feet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Corporal Eastman swept past and above him,
turned, glided back in, and dropped fifty yards way. Martin was unbuckling his
chute harness and did not see Kevin North land at all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In fact, the mountaineer was the fourth and
last in the line, descending a hundred yards away but onto the slope of the
hill rather than the grassland. He was trying to close up to his colleagues,
hauling down on his static lines, when the Bergen beneath him hit the hill. As
it touched the ground, the Bergen was dragged sideways by the drifting man
above, to whose waist it was attached. It bumped along the hillside for five
yards, then snagged between two rocks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sudden yank on the lanyard pulled North down
and sideways so that he landed not on his feet but on his side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were not many rocks on that hillside, but
one of them smashed his left femur in eight places.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The corporal felt the bone shatter with
complete clarity, but the jar was so severe, it numbed the pain for a few
seconds. Then it came in waves. He rolled over and clutched his thigh with two
hands, whispering over and over, <i>No, no, please God, no</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Though he did not realize it because it
happened inside the leg, he began to bleed. One of the shards of bone in the
multiple fracture had sliced clean through the femoral artery, which began to
pump out his life-blood into the mess of his thigh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other three found him a minute later. They
had all unhitched their billowing chutes and Bergens, convinced he would be
doing the same. When they realized he was not with them, they came to look.
Stephenson brought out his penlight and shone it on the leg.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Oh, shit,” he whispered. They had first-aid
kits, even shell dressings, but nothing to cope with this. The corporal needed
trauma therapy, plasma, major surgery—and fast. Stephenson ran back to North’s
Bergen, ripped out a first-aid kit, and began to prepare a jab of morphine.
There was no need. With the blood, the pain was fading.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>North opened his eyes, focused on the face of
Mike Martin above him, whispered “I’m sorry, boss,” and closed his eyes again.
Two minutes later he was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At another time, and in another place, Martin
might have been able to vent some sign of what he felt at losing a man like
North, operating under his command. There was no time; this was not the place.
The two remaining NCOs recognized this and went about what they had to do in
grim silence. Grief could come later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin had hoped to bundle up the spilled
parachutes and clear the valley before finding a rocky crevasse to bury the
surplus gear. Now that was impossible. He had North’s body to cope with.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Pete, start getting together everything we
bury. Find a hollow scrape somewhere, or make one. Ben, start collecting rocks.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin bent over the body, removed the dog tags
and machine pistol, then went to help Eastman. Together, with knives and hands,
the three men scraped a hollow in the springy turf and laid the body in it.
There was more to pile on top: four opened main parachutes, four still-packed
reserves, four oxygen bottles, lanyards, webbing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then they began to pile rocks on top, not in a
neat shape like a cairn, which would have been spotted, but in a random way, as
if the rocks had tumbled from the mountainside. Water was brought from the
brook to sluice the rock and the grass of its red stains. Bare patches where
the rocks they were using had stood were scuffed with feet, and fragments of
moss from the water’s edge were stamped into them. The valley had to be made to
look as much as possible as it had an hour before midnight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They had hoped to put in five hours of marching
before dawn, but the job took them over three. Some of the contents of North’s
Bergen stayed inside and were buried with him: his clothes, food, and water.
Other items they had to divide between them, making their own loads even
heavier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An hour before dawn, they left the valley and
went into SOP—standing operating procedure. Sergeant Stephenson took the role
of lead scout, moving up ahead of the other two, dropping to the ground before
cresting a ridge to peer over the top in case there was a nasty surprise on the
other side.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The route lay upward, and he set a grueling
pace. Although a small and wiry man, and five years older than Martin, he could
march most men clean off their feet and carry an eighty-pound load while he did
it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Clouds came over the mountains just when Martin
needed them, delaying the dawn and giving him an extra hour. In ninety minutes
of hard march they covered eight miles, putting several ridges and two hills
between them and the valley. Finally the advance of the gray light forced them
to look for a place to conceal themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin chose a horizontal crack in the rocks
under an overhang, screened by sere grass and just above a dry wadi. In the
last of the darkness they ate some rations, sipped water, covered themselves
with scrim netting, and lay down to sleep. There were three duty watches, and
Martin took the first.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He nudged Stephenson awake at eleven <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.M.</span> and slept while the sergeant stood guard.
It was at four <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> that Ben Eastman
poked Martin in the ribs with a rigid finger. As the major’s eyes opened, he
saw Eastman with his forefinger to his lips. Martin listened. From the wadi ten
feet beneath their ledge came the guttural sounds of voices in Arabic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sergeant Stephenson came awake and raised an
eyebrow. What do we do now? Martin listened for a while. There were four of
them, on patrol, bored with their task of endlessly marching through the
mountains, and tired. Within ten minutes he knew they intended to camp there
for the night.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had lost enough time already. He needed to
move by six, when darkness would fall over the hills, and he needed every hour
to cover the miles to those crevices in the hill across the valley from the
Fortress. He might need more time to search for those crevices and find them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The conversation from the wadi below indicated
that the Iraqis were going to search for wood for a campfire. They would be
certain to cast an eye on the bushes behind which the SAS men lay. Even if they
did not, it might be hours before they would sleep deeply enough for Martin’s
patrol to slip past them and get away. There was no choice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At a signal from Martin, the other two eased
out their flat, double-edged knives, and the three men slid over the scree into
the wadi below.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When the job was over, Martin flicked through
the dead Iraqis’ paybooks. All of them, he noticed, had the patronymic
Al-Ubaidi. They were all of the Ubaidi tribe, mountain men who came from these
parts. All wore the insignia of the Republican Guard. Clearly the Guard had
been culled from these mountain fighters to form the patrols whose job was to
keep the Fortress safe from intruders. He noted they were lean, spare men,
without an ounce of fat on them, and probably tireless in hill country like
this.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It still cost an hour to drag the four bodies
into the crevice, cut apart their camouflaged tent to form a tarpaulin, and
decorate the tarp with bushes, weeds, and grass. But when they were finished,
it would have taken an extremely sharp eye to spot the hiding place beneath the
overhang. Fortunately, the Iraqi patrol had had no radio, so they would
probably not check in with their base until they arrived back—whenever that
might be. Now, they would never get back, but with luck it would be two days
before they were missed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As darkness set in, the SAS men marched on,
trying by the starlight to recall the shapes of the mountains in the
photographs, following the compass heading toward the mountain they sought.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The map Martin carried was a brilliant
confection, drawn by a computer on the basis of the aerial photos by the TR-1
and showing the route between the DZ and the intended lying-up position.
Pausing at intervals to consult his hand-held SATNAV positioner and study the
map by penlight, Martin could check their direction and progress. By midnight,
both were good. He estimated a further ten miles to march.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the Brecons in Wales, Martin and his men
could have kept up four miles an hour over this kind of terrain, a brisk walk
on a flat surface for those taking their dogs for an evening stroll without an
eighty-pound rucksack. Marching at that rate was quite normal. But in these
hostile hills, with the possibility of patrols all around them, progress had to
be slower. They had had one brush with the Iraqis, and a second would be too
many.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An advantage they had over the Iraqis was their
NVGs, the night-vision goggles they wore like frogs’ eyes on stalks. With the
new wide-angle version they could see the countryside ahead of them in a pale
green glow, for the job of the image-intensifiers was to gather every scrap of
natural light in the environment and concentrate it into the viewer’s retina.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Two hours before dawn, they saw the bulk of the
Fortress in front of them and began to climb the slope to their left. The
mountain they had chosen was on the southern fringe of the square kilometer
provided by Jericho, and from the crevices near the summit they should be able
to look across at the southern face of the Fortress—if indeed it was the
Fortress—at an almost equal height to its peak.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They climbed hard for an hour, their breath
coming in rasping gasps. Sergeant Stephenson in the lead cut into a tiny goat
track that led upward and around the curve of the mountain. Just short of the
summit, they found the crevice the TR-1 had seen on its down-and-sideways
camera. It was better than Martin could have hoped—a natural crack in the rock
eight feet long, four feet deep, and two feet high. Outside the crack was a
ledge two feet across, on which Martin’s torso could lie with his lower body
and feet inside the rocks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The men brought out their scrim netting and
began to make their niche invisible to watching eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Food and water were stuffed into the pouches of
the belt orders, Martin’s technical equipment laid ready to hand, weapons
checked and set close by. Just before the sun rose, Martin used one of his
devices.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a transmitter, much smaller than the one
he had had in Baghdad, barely the size of two cigarette packs. It was linked to
a cadmium-nickel battery with enough power to give him more talking time than
he would ever need.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The frequency was fixed, and at the other end
there was a listening watch for twenty-four hours a day. To attract attention
he only had to press the transmit button in an agreed sequence of blips and
pauses, then wait for the speaker to respond with the answering sequence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The third component of the set was a dish
aerial, a fold-away like the one in Baghdad but smaller. Though he was now farther
north than the Iraqi capital, he was also much higher.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin set up the dish, pointing toward the
south, linked the battery to the set and the set to the aerial, then pressed
the transmit button. One-two-three-four-five; pause; one-two-three; pause; one;
pause; one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Five seconds later, the radio in his hand
squawked softly. Four blips, four blips, two.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He pressed transmit, kept the thumb down, and
said into the speaker:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Come Nineveh, come Tyre. I say again, Come
Nineveh, come Tyre.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He released the transmit button and waited. The
set gave an excited one-two-three; pause; one; pause; four. Received and
acknowledged.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin put the set away in its waterproof
cover, took his powerful field glasses, and eased his torso onto the ledge.
Behind him Sergeant Stephenson and Corporal Eastman were sandwiched like
embryos into the crevice under the rock, but apparently quite comfortable. Two
twigs held up the netting in front of him, giving a slit through which he slid
the binoculars, for which a bird-watcher would have given his right arm.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As the sun seeped into the mountains of Hamreen
on the morning of February 23, Major Martin began to study the masterpiece of
his old school friend Osman Badri—the Qa’ala that no machine could see.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In Riyadh, Steve Laing and Simon Paxman stared
at the sheet handed them by the engineer who had come running out of the radio
shack.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody hell,” said Laing with feeling. “He’s
there—he’s on the frigging mountain!”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Twenty minutes later, the news reached Al Kharz
from General Glosson’s office.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Captain Don Walker had returned to his base in the small
hours of the twenty-second, grabbed some sleep in what was left of the night,
and begun work just after sunrise, when the pilots who had flown missions
during the night were completing their debriefing and shuffling off to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By midday, he had a plan to present to his
superior officers. It was sent at once to Riyadh and approved. During the
afternoon the appropriate aircraft, crew, and support services were allocated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What was planned was a four-ship raid on an
Iraqi air base well north of Baghdad called Tikrit East, not far from the
birthplace of Saddam Hussein. It would be a night raid with two-thousand-pound
laser-guided bombs. Don Walker would lead it, with his usual wingman and
another element of two Eagles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Miraculously the mission appeared on the Air
Tasking Order from Riyadh, although it had only been devised twelve hours and
not three days earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The other three needed crews were at once taken
off any other tasking and assigned to the Tikrit East mission, slated for the
night of the twenty-second (maybe) or any other night they were ordered. Until
then, they were on permanent one-hour standby.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The four Strike Eagles were prepared by sundown
of the twenty-second, and at ten <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> the
mission was canceled. No other mission was substituted. The eight aircrew were told
to rest, while the remainder of the squadron went tank-zapping among the
Republican Guard units north of Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When they returned in the dawn of the
twenty-third, the four idle aircrew came in for their turn of ribbing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With the mission planning staff, a route was
worked out for Tikrit East that would take the four Eagles up the corridor
between Baghdad and the Iranian border to the east, with a turn of course
through forty-five degrees over Lake As Sa’diyah and then straight on,
northwest to Tikrit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As he sipped his breakfast coffee in the mess
hall, Don Walker was summoned outside by his squadron commander.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Your target marker is in place,” he was told. “Get
some rest. It could be a rough night.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>By the rising sun, Mike Martin began to study the mountain
across the steep valley. On full magnification his glasses could pick out
individual bushes; pulling the focus back, he could see an area any size he
wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For the first hour it looked like just a
mountain. The grass grew, as on all the others. There were stunted shrubs and
bushes, as on all the rest. Here and there a patch of bare rock, occasionally a
small boulder, clung to the slopes. like all the other hills within his vision,
it was of an irregular shape. There seemed nothing out of place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>From time to time he squeezed his eyes tightly
to rest them, pillowed his head on his forearms for a while, and started again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By midmorning, a pattern began to emerge. On
certain parts of the mountain the grass appeared to grow in a manner different
from that on other parts. There were areas where the vegetation seemed too
regular, as if in lines. But there was no door, unless it was on the other
side, no road, no track with tire marks, no standpipe venting foul air from
inside, no mark of present or previous excavation. It was the moving sun that
gave the first clue.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shortly after eleven, he thought he caught a
glint of something in the grass. He brought the glasses back to that patch and
went to full magnification. The sun went behind a cloud. When it came out, the
glint flashed again. Then he saw the source: a fragment of wire in the grass.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He blinked and tried again. Slantwise, it was a
length of wire a foot long in the grass. It was part of a longer strand, green
plastic-covered wire, of which a small part had been abraded to reveal the
metal beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The wire was one of several he glimpsed, all
buried in the grass, occasionally revealed as the wind blew the stems from side
to side. Diagonals in the opposite direction, a patch of chain-link wire,
underneath the grass.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By midday, he could see it better. A section of
mountainside where green wire mesh held the soil to a surface below the earth;
the grass and shrubs planted in every diamond-shaped gap between the fencing,
growing through the gaps, covering the wire beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then he saw the terracing. One part of the
mountainside was made up of blocks, presumably concrete, each set back three
inches from the one below it. Along the horizontal terraces thus created were
runnels of earth out of which the shrubs grew. Where they sprouted, they were
in horizontal lines. At first it did not look so, because they were of
different heights, but when he studied their stems only, it became clear they were
indeed in lines. Nature does not grow in lines.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He tried other parts of the mountain, but the
pattern ended, then began again farther to his left. It was in the early
afternoon that he solved it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The analysts in Riyadh had been right—up to a
point. Had anyone attempted to gouge out the whole center of the hill, it would
have fallen in. Whoever had done this must have taken three existing hills, cut
away the inner faces, and built up the gaps between the peaks to create a
gigantic crater.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In filling the gaps, the builder had followed
the contours of the real hills, stepping his rows of concrete blocks backward
and upward, creating the miniterraces, pouring tens of thousands of tons of
topsoil down from the top.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The cladding must have come later: sheets of
green vinyl-coated chain-link wire presumably stapled to the concrete beneath,
holding the earth to the slopes. Then the grass seed, sprayed onto the earth,
there to root and spread, with bushes and shrubs sown into deeper bowls left in
the concrete terraces.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The grass from the previous summer had matted,
creating its own bonding network of roots, and the shrubs had sprouted up
through the wire and the grass to match the undergrowth on the original hills.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Above the crater, the roof of the fortress was
surely a geodesic dome, so cast that it too contained thousands of pockets
where grass could grow. There were even artificial boulders, painted the gray
of real rocks, with streaks where the rain had run off.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin began to concentrate on the area near
the point where the rim of the crater would have been before the construction
of the rotunda.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was about fifty feet below the summit of the
dome that he found what he sought. He had already swept his glasses across the
slight protuberance fifty times and had not noticed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a rocky outcrop, faded gray, but two
black lines ran across it from side to side. The more he studied the lines, the
more he wondered why anyone would have clambered so high to draw two lines
across a boulder.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A squall of wind came from the northeast,
ruffling the scrim netting around his face. The same wind caused one of the
lines to move. When the wind dropped, the line ceased to move. Then Martin
realized they were not drawn lines but steel wires, running across the rock and
away into the grass.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Smaller boulders stood around the perimeter of
the large one, like sentries in a ring. Why so circular, why steel wires?
Supposing someone, down below, jerked hard on those wires—would the boulder
move?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At half past three he realized it was not a
boulder. It was a gray tarpaulin, weighted down by a circle of rocks, to be twitched
to one side when the wires were jerked downward into the cavern beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Under the tarp he gradually made out a shape,
circular, five feet in diameter. He was staring at a canvas sheet, beneath
which, invisible to him, the last three feet of the Babylon gun projected, from
its breech two hundred yards inside the crater up into the sky. It was pointing
south-southeast toward Dhahran, 750 kilometers away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Rangefinder,” he muttered to the men behind
him. He passed back the binoculars and took the implement offered to him. It
was like a telescope.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When he held it to his eye, as they had shown
him in Riyadh, he saw the mountain and the tarp that hid the gun, but not with
any magnification.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the prism were four V-shaped chevrons, the
points all directed inward. Slowly he rotated the knurled knob on the side of
the scope until all four points touched each other to form a cross. The cross
rested on the tarpaulin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Taking the scope from his eye, he consulted the
numbers on the rotating band. One thousand and eighty yards.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Compass,” he said. He pushed the rangefinder
behind him and took the electronic compass. This was no device dependent on a
dish swimming in a bowl of alcohol, nor even a pointer balanced on a gimbal. He
held it to his eye, sighted the tarpaulin across the valley, and pressed the
button. The compass did the rest, giving him a bearing from his own position to
the tarpaulin of 348 degrees, ten minutes, and eighteen seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The SATNAV positioner gave him the last thing
he needed—his own exact location on the planet’s surface, to the nearest square
fifteen yards by fifteen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a clumsy business trying to erect the
satellite dish in the confined space, and it took ten minutes. When he called
Riyadh, the response was immediate. Slowly Martin read to the listeners in the
Saudi capital three sets of figures: his own exact position, the compass
direction from himself to the target, and the range. Riyadh could work out the
rest and give the pilot his coordinates.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin crawled back into the crevice, to be
replaced by Stephenson, who would keep an eye open for Iraqi patrols, and tried
to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At half-past eight, in complete darkness,
Martin tested the infrared target marker. In shape it was like a large flash
lamp with a pistol-grip, but it had an eyepiece in back.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He linked it to its battery, aimed it at the
Fortress, and looked. The whole mountain was as clearly lit as if bathed in a
great green moon. He swung the barrel of the image intensifier up to the
tarpaulin that masked the barrel of the Babylon and squeezed the
pistol-trigger.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A single, invisible beam of infrared light
raced across the valley, and he saw a small red dot appear on the mountainside.
Moving the night-sight, he settled the red dot on the tarpaulin and kept it
there for half a minute. Satisfied, he switched it off and crawled back beneath
the netting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The four Strike Eagles took off from Al Kharz at ten
forty-five <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>P.M.</span> and climbed to twenty
thousand feet. For three of the crews, it was a routine mission to hit an Iraqi
air base. Each Eagle carried two two-thousand-pound laser-guided bombs, in
addition to their self-defense air-to-air missiles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Refueling from their designated KC-10 tanker
just south of the Iraqi border was normal and uneventful. When they were topped
up, they turned away in loose formation, and the flight, coded Bluejay, set
course almost due north, passing over the Iraqi town of As-Samawah at 11:14.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They flew in radio silence as always and
without lights, each wizzo able to see the other three aircraft clearly on his
radar. The night was clear, and the AWACS over the Gulf had given them a “picture
clear” advice, meaning no Iraqi fighters were up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At 11:39, Don Walker’s wizzo muttered:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Turning point in five.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They all heard it and understood they would be
turning over Lake As Sa’diyah in five minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just as they went into the forty-five-degree
turn to port, to set the new heading for Tikrit East, the other three aircrew
heard Don Walker say quite clearly:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bluejay Flight Leader has ... engine problems.
I’m going to RTB. Bluejay Three, take over.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bluejay Three was Bull Baker that night, leader
of the other two-plane element. From that transmission onward, things began to
go wrong, in a very weird manner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker’s wingman Randy “R-2” Roberts closed up
with his leader but could see no apparent trouble from Walker’s engines, yet
the Bluejay leader was losing power and height. If he was going to RTB—return
to base—it would be normal for his wingman to stay with him, unless the problem
was minimal. Engine trouble far over enemy territory is not minimal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Roger that,” acknowledged Baker. Then they
heard Walker say:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bluejay Two, rejoin Bluejay Three, I say
again, rejoin. That is an order. Proceed to Tikrit East.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The wingman, now baffled, did as he was ordered
and climbed back to rejoin the remainder of Bluejay. Their commander continued
to lose height over the lake; they could see him on their radars.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the same moment they realized he had done
the unthinkable. For some reason—confusion caused by the engine problem,
perhaps—he had spoken not on the Have-quick coded radio, but “in clear.” More
amazingly, he had actually mentioned their destination.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Out over the Gulf, a young USAF sergeant manning
part of the battery of consoles in the hull of the AWACS plane summoned his
mission commander in perplexity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“We have a problem, sir. Bluejay Leader has
engine trouble. He wants to RTB.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Right, noted,” said the mission commander. In
most airplanes the pilot is the captain and in complete charge. In an AWACS the
pilot has that charge for the safety of the airplane, but the mission commander
calls the shots when it comes to giving orders across the air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“But sir,” protested the sergeant, “Bluejay
Leader spoke in clear. Gave the mission target. Shall I RTB them all?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Negative, mission continues,” said the
controller. “Carry on.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The sergeant returned to his console completely
bewildered. This was madness: If the Iraqis had heard that transmission, their
air defenses at Tikrit East would be on full alert.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then he heard Walker again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bluejay Leader, Mayday, Mayday. Both engines
out. Ejecting.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was still speaking in clear. The Iraqis, if
they were listening, could have heard it all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In fact, the sergeant was right—the messages
had been heard. At Tikrit East the gunners were hauling their tarpaulins off
their triple-A, and the heat-seeking missiles were waiting for the sound of
incoming engines. Other units were being alerted to go at once to the area of
the lake to search for two downed aircrew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sir, Bluejay Leader is down. We have to RTB
the rest of them.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Noted. Negative,” said the mission commander.
He glanced at his watch. He had his orders. He did not know why, but he would
obey them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Bluejay Flight was by then nine minutes from
target, heading into a reception committee. The three pilots rode their Eagles
in stony silence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the AWACS the sergeant could still see the
blip of Bluejay Leader, way down over the surface of the lake. Clearly the
Eagle had been abandoned and would crash at any moment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Four minutes later, the mission commander
appeared to change his mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bluejay Flight, AWACS to Bluejay Flight, RTB,
I say again RTB.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three Strike Eagles, despondent at the
night’s events, peeled away from their course and set heading for home. The
Iraqi gunners at Tikrit East, deprived of radar, waited in vain for another
hour.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the southern fringes of the Jebal al Hamreen
another Iraqi listening post had heard the interchange. The signals colonel in
charge was not tasked with alerting Tikrit East or any other air base to
approaching enemy aircraft. His sole job was to ensure none entered the Jebal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>As Bluejay Flight turned over the lake, he had
gone to amber alert; the track from the lake to the air base would have taken
the Eagles along the southern fringe of the range. When one of them crashed, he
was delighted; when the other three peeled away to the south, he was relieved.
He stood his alert down.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker had spiraled down to the surface of
the lake until he levelled at one hundred feet and made his Mayday call. As he
skimmed the waters of As Sa’diyah, he punched in his new coordinates and turned
north into the Jebal. At the same time he went to LANTIRN, with whose aid he
could look through his canopy and see the landscape ahead of him, clearly lit
by the infrared beam being emitted from beneath his wing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Columns of information on his Head-Up Display
were now giving him course and speed, height, and time to Launch Point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He could have gone to automatic pilot, allowing
the computer to fly the Eagle, throwing it down the canyons and the valleys,
past the cliffs and hillsides, while the pilot kept his hands on his thighs.
But he preferred to stay on manual and fly it himself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>With the aid of recon photos supplied by the
Black Hole, he had plotted a course up through the range that never let him
come above the skyline. He stayed low, hugging the valley floors, swerving from
gap to gap, a roller-coaster zigzag course that carried him upward into the
range toward the Fortress.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When Walker made his Mayday call, Mike Martin’s
radio had squawked out a series of preagreed blips. Martin had crawled forward
to the ledge above the valley, aimed the infrared target marker at the
tarpaulin a thousand yards away, settled the red dot onto the dead center of
the target, and now kept it there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The blips on the radio had meant “seven minutes
to bomb launch,” and from then on Martin was not to move the red spot by an
inch.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“About time,” muttered Eastman. “I’m bloody
freezing in here.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Not long,” said Stephenson, cramming the last
bits and pieces into his Bergen. “Then you’ll have all the running you want, Benny.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Only the radio remained unpacked, ready for its
next transmission.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the rear seat of the Eagle, Tim, the wizzo,
could see the same information as his pilot. Four minutes to launch, three-thirty,
three ... the figures on the HUD counted down as the Eagle screamed through the
mountains to its target. It flashed over the small dip where Martin and his men
had landed, and took seconds to cover the terrain across which they had labored
beneath their packs. “Ninety seconds to launch ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The SAS men heard the sound of the engines
coming from the south as the Eagle began its loft.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fighter-bomber came over the last ridge
three miles south of the target, just as the countdown hit zero. In the
darkness the two torpedo-shaped bombs left their pylons beneath the wings and
climbed for a few seconds, driven by their own inertia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the three dummy villages the Republican Guards
were drowned in the roar of the jet engines erupting from nowhere over their
heads, jumped from their bunks, and ran to their weapons. In a few seconds the
roofs of the forage barns were lifting away on their hydraulic jacks to expose
the missiles beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two bombs felt the tug of gravity and began
to fall. In their noses, infrared seekers sniffed for the guiding beam, the
upturned bucket of invisible rays bouncing back from the red spot on their
target, the bucket which, once entered, they could never leave.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Mike Martin lay prone, waiting, buffeted by
engine noise as the mountains trembled, and held the red dot steady on the
Babylon gun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He never saw the bombs. One second he was
gazing at a pale green mountain in the light of the image intensifier; the
next, he had to pull his eyes away and shield them as night turned into
blood-red day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two bombs impacted simultaneously, three
seconds before the Guard colonel deep below the hollow mountain reached for his
Launch lever. He never made it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Looking across the valley without the night-sight,
Martin saw the entire top of the Fortress erupt in flame. By its glare, he
caught the fleeting image of a massive barrel, rearing like a stricken beast,
twisting and turning in the blast, breaking, and crashing back with the
fragments of the dome into the crater beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody hellfire,” whispered Sergeant
Stephenson at his elbow. It was not a bad analogy. Orange fire began to glow
down in the crater as the first explosion flashes died away and a dim
half-light returned to the mountains. Martin began keying in his alert codes
for the listeners in Riyadh.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker had rolled the Eagle after the bomb
launch, pulling 135 degrees of bank, hauling down and through to find and
pursue a reciprocal heading back to the south. But because he was not over flat
land and mountains rose all around him, he had to gain more altitude than
normal or risk clipping one of the peaks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was the village farthest away from the
Fortress that got the best shot. For a fraction of a second he was above them,
on one wingtip, pulling around to the south, when the two missiles were
launched. These were not Russian SAMs but the best Iraq had—Franco-German
Rolands.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first was low, racing after the Eagle as it
dropped out of sight across the mountains. The Roland failed to clear the
ridge. The second skimmed the rocks of the peak and caught up with the fighter
in the next valley. Walker felt the tremendous shock as the missile impacted
into the body of his aircraft, destroying and almost ripping out the starboard
engine. The Eagle was thrown across the sky, its delicate systems in disarray,
flaming fuel forming a comet’s tail behind it. Walker tested the controls, a
soggy pudding where once there had been firm response. It was over, his
airplane was dying underneath him, all his fire-warning lights were on, and
thirty tons of burning metal were about to fall out of the sky.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Eject, eject ...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The canopy automatically shattered a
microsecond before the two ejector seats came through, shooting upward into the
night, turning, stabilizing. Their sensors knew at once that they were too low
and blew apart the straps retaining the pilot into his seat, throwing him clear
of the falling metal so that his parachute could open.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker had never bailed out before. The sense
of shock numbed him for a while, robbed him of the power of decision.
Fortunately the manufacturers had thought of that. As the heavy metal seat fell
away, the parachute snapped itself open and unfurled. Dazed, Walker found
himself in pitch darkness, swinging in his harness over a valley he could not
see.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not a long drop—he had been far too low
for that. In seconds the ground came up and hit him, and he was knocked over,
tumbling, rolling, hands frantically scrabbling for the harness-release catch.
Then the parachute was gone, blowing away down the valley, and he was on his
back on wiry turf. He got up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Tim,” he called. “Tim, you okay?” He began to
run up the valley floor, looking for another chute, certain they had both
landed in the same area.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He was right in that. Both airmen had fallen
two valleys to the south of their target. In the sky to the north he could make
out a dim reddish glow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After three minutes he crashed into something
and banged his knee. He thought it was a rock, but in the dim light he saw it
was one of the ejector seats. His, perhaps. Tim’s? He went on looking.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Walker found his wizzo. The young man had
ejected perfectly, but the missile blast had wrecked the seat-separation unit
on his ejector. He had landed on the mountainside locked into the seat, his
parachute still tucked beneath him. The impact of the crash had torn the body
from the seat at last, but no man survives a shock like that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Tim Nathanson lay on his back in the valley, a
tangle of broken limbs, his face masked by his helmet and visor. Walker tore
away the mask, removed the dog tags, turned away from the glow in the
mountains, and began to run, tears streaming down his face.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He ran until he could run no more, then found a
crevice in the mountain and crawled in to rest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Two minutes after the explosions in the Fortress, Martin
had his contact with Riyadh. He sent his series of blips and then his message.
It was:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Now Barrabas, I say again, Now Barrabas.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The three SAS men closed down the radio, packed
it, hitched their Bergens onto their backs, and began to get off the mountain—fast.
There would be patrols now as never before, looking not for them—it was
unlikely the Iraqis would work out for some time how the bombing raid had been
so accurate—but for the downed American aircrew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sergeant Stephenson had taken a bearing on the
flaming jet as it passed over their heads, and the direction it had fallen.
Assuming it had careered on for a while after the ejections, the aircrew, had
they survived, ought to be somewhere along that heading. The SAS men moved
fast, just ahead of the Ubaidi tribesmen of the Guard, who were then pouring
out of their villages and heading upward into the range.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Twenty minutes later, Mike Martin and the two
other SAS men found the body of the dead weapons systems officer. There was
nothing they could do, so they moved on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ten minutes afterward, they heard behind them
the continuous rattle of small-arms fire. It continued for some time. The
Al-Ubaidi had found the body too and in their rage had emptied their magazines
into it. The gesture also gave their position away. The SAS men pressed on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Don Walker hardly felt the blade of Sergeant
Stephenson’s knife against his throat. It was light as a thread of silk on the
gullet. But he looked up and saw the figure of a man standing over him. He was
dark and lean; there was a gun in his right hand pointing at Walker’s chest;
and the man wore the uniform of a captain in the Iraqi Republican Guard,
Mountain Division. Then the man spoke:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Bloody silly time to drop in for tea. Shall we
just get the hell out of here?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That night General Norman Schwarzkopf was sitting alone in
his suite on the fourth floor of the Saudi Defense Ministry building.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not where he had spent much of the past
seven months; most of that time he had been out visiting as many combat units
as he could, or down in the subbasement with his staff and planners. But the
large and comfortable office was where he went when he wanted to be alone.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That night he sat at his desk, adorned by the
red telephone that linked him in a top-security net to Washington, and waited.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At ten minutes before one on the morning of
February 24, the other phone rang.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“General Schwarzkopf?” It was a British accent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Yes. This is he.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“I have a message for you, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Shoot.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It is: ‘Now Barrabas,’ sir. ‘Now Barrabas.’ ”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Thank you,” said the Commander-in-Chief, and
replaced the receiver. At 0400 hours that day, the ground invasion went in.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942774">Chapter 23</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The three SAS men marched hard through the rest of the
night. They set a pace onward and upward that left Don Walker, who carried no
rucksack and thought he was in good physical shape, exhausted and gasping for
breath.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Sometimes he would drop to his knees, aware
that he could go no farther, that even death would be preferable to the endless
pain in every muscle. When that happened, he would feel two steely hands, one
under each armpit, and hear the Cockney voice of Sergeant Stephenson in his
ear:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Come on, mate. Only a little farther. See that
ridge? We’ll probably rest on the other side of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But they never did. Instead of heading south to
the foothills of the Jebal al Hamreen, where he figured they would have met a
screen of Republican Guards with vehicles, Mike Martin headed east into the
high hills running to the Iranian border. It was a tack that forced the patrols
of the Al-Ubaidi mountain men to come after them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just after dawn, looking back and down, Martin
saw a group of six of them, fitter than the rest, still climbing and closing.
When the Republican Guards reached the next crest, they found one of their
quarry sitting slumped on the ground, facing away from them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Dropping behind the rocks, the tribesmen opened
up, riddling the foreigner through the back. The corpse toppled over. The six
men in the Guard patrol broke cover and ran forward.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Too late, they saw that the body was a Bergen
rucksack, draped with a camouflaged smock, topped by Walker’s flying helmet.
Three silenced Heckler and Koch MP5s cut them down as they stood around the “body.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Above the town of Khanaqin, Martin finally
called a halt and made a transmission to Riyadh. Stephenson and Eastman kept
watch, facing west, from where any pursuing patrols must come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin simply told Riyadh that there were three
SAS men left and they had a single American flier with them. In case the
message was intercepted, he did not give their position. Then they pressed on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>High in the mountains, close to the border,
they found shelter in a stone hut, used by the local shepherds in summer when
the flocks came to the upper pastures. There, with guards posted in rotation,
they waited out the four days of the ground war, as far to the south the Allied
tanks and air power crushed the Iraqi Army in a ninety-hour blitzkrieg and
rolled into Kuwait.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On that same day, the first of the ground war, a lone
soldier entered Iraq from the west. He was an Israeli of the Sayeret Matkal
commandos, picked for his excellent Arabic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>An Israeli helicopter, fitted with long-range
tanks and in the livery of the Jordanian Army, came out of the Negev and
skimmed across the Jordanian desert to deposit the man just inside Iraq, south
of the Ruweishid crossing point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When it had left him, it turned and flew back
across Jordan and into Israel, unspotted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Like Martin, the soldier had a lightweight,
rugged motorcycle with heavy-duty desert tires. Although disguised to look old,
battered, dirty, rusted, and dented, its engine was in superb condition, and it
carried extra fuel in two panniers astride the back wheel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The soldier followed the main road eastward and
at sundown entered Baghdad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The concerns of his superiors for his security
had been overcautious. By that amazing bush telegraph that seems able to
outstrip even electronics, the people of Baghdad already knew their army was
being crushed in the deserts of southern Iraq and Kuwait. By the evening of the
first day, the AMAM had taken to its barracks and stayed there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now that the bombing had stopped—for all the
Allied airplanes were needed over the battlefield—the people of Baghdad circulated
freely, talking openly of the imminent arrival of the Americans and British to
sweep away Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a euphoria that would last a week, until
it became plain the Allies were not coming, and the rule of the AMAM closed
over them again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The central bus station was a seething mass of
soldiers, most stripped down to singlets and shorts, having thrown away their
uniforms in the desert. These were the deserters who had evaded the execution
squads waiting behind the front line. They were selling their Kalashnikovs for
the price of a ticket home to their villages. At the start of the week, these
rifles were fetching thirty-five dinars each; four days later, the price was
down to seventeen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Israeli infiltrator had one job, which he
accomplished during the night. The Mossad knew only of the three dead-letter
boxes for getting a message to Jericho that had been left behind by Alfonso
Benz Moncada in August. As it happened, Martin had discontinued two of them for
security reasons, but the third still operated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Israeli deposited identical messages in all
three drops, made the three appropriate chalk marks, took his motorcycle, and
rode west again, joining the throng of refugees heading that way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took him another day to reach the border.
Here he cut south of the main road into empty desert, crossed into Jordan,
recovered his hidden directional beacon, and used it. The <i>bleep-bleep </i>beam
was picked up at once by an Israeli aircraft circling over the Negev, and the
helicopter returned to the rendezvous to recover the infiltrator.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He did not sleep for those fifty hours and ate
little, but he fulfilled his mission and returned home safely.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On the third day of the ground war, Edith Hardenberg
returned to her desk at the Winkler Bank, both puzzled and angry. On the
previous morning, just as she had been about to leave for work, she had
received a telephone call.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The speaker, in faultless German with a
Salzburg accent, introduced himself as the neighbor of her mother. He told her
that Frau Hardenberg had had a bad fall down the stairs after slipping on an
icy patch and was in a bad way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She at once tried to call her mother but
repeatedly got a busy signal. Finally frantic, she had called the Salzburg
exchange, who informed her the phone must be out of order.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Telephoning the bank that she would not be in
for work, she had driven to Salzburg through the snow and slush, arriving in
the late morning. Her mother, perfectly fit and well, was surprised to see her.
There had been no fall, no injury. Worse, some vandal had cut her telephone
line outside the flat.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>By the time Edith Hardenberg returned to
Vienna, it was too late to go in for work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When she appeared at her desk the next morning,
she found Wolfgang Gemütlich in an even worse mood than she. He reproached her
bitterly for her absence the previous day and listened to her explanation in a
bad humor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The reason for his own misery was not long in
coming. In the midmorning of the previous day, a young man had appeared at the
bank and insisted on seeing him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The visitor explained that his name was Aziz
and that he was the son of the owner of a substantial numbered account. His
father, explained the Arab, was indisposed but wished his son to act in his
place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At this, Aziz Junior had produced documentation
that fully and perfectly authenticated him as his father’s ambassador, with
complete authority to operate the numbered account. Herr Gemütlich had examined
the documents of authority for the slightest flaw, but there was none. He had
been left with no alternative but to concede.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The young wretch had insisted that his father’s
wishes were to close down the entire account and transfer the contents
elsewhere. This, mind you, Fräulein Hardenberg, just two days after the arrival
in the account of a further $3 million credit, bringing the aggregate total to
over $10 million.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Edith Hardenberg listened to Gemütlich’s tale
of woe very quietly, then asked about the visitor. Yes, she was told, his first
name had been Karim. Now that she mentioned it, there had been a signet ring
with a pink opal on the small finger of one hand and, indeed, a scar along the
chin. Had he been less consumed by his own sense of outrage, the banker might
have wondered at such precise questioning by his secretary about a man she
could not have seen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had known, of course, Gemütlich admitted,
that the account-holder must be some sort of Arab, but he had had no idea that
the man was from Iraq or had a son.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After work, Edith Hardenberg went home and
began to clean her little flat. She scrubbed and scoured it for hours. There
were two cardboard boxes that she took to the large rubbish bin a few hundred
yards away and dumped. One contained a number of items of makeup, perfumes,
lotions, and bath salts; the other, a variety of women’s underwear. Then she
returned to her cleaning.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Neighbors said later she played music through
the evening and late into the night—not her usual Mozart and Strauss but Verdi,
especially something from <i>Nabucco</i>. A particularly keen-eared neighbor
identified the piece as the “Slaves’ Chorus,” which she played over and over
again.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the small hours of the morning the music
stopped, and she left in her car with two items from her kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was a retired accountant, walking his dog in
the Prater Park at seven the next morning, who found her. He had left the
Hauptallee to allow his dog to do its business in the park away from the road.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was in her neat gray tweed coat, with her
hair in a bun behind her head, thick lisle stockings on her legs, and sensible
flat-heeled shoes on her feet. The clothesline looped over the branch of the
oak had not betrayed her, and the kitchen steps were a meter away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>She was quite still and stiff in death, her
hands by her side and her toes pointed neatly downward. Always a very neat lady
was Edith Hardenberg.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>February 28 was the last day of the ground war. In the
Iraqi deserts west of Kuwait, the Iraqi Army had been outflanked and
annihilated. South of the city, the Republican Guard divisions that had rolled
into Kuwait on August 2 ceased to exist. On that day the forces occupying the
city, having set fire to everything that would burn and seeking to destroy what
would not, left for the north in a snaking column of halftracks, trucks, vans,
cars, and carts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The column was caught in the place where the
highway north cuts through the Mutla Ridge. The Eagles and Jaguars, Tomcats and
Hornets, Tornados and Thunderbolts, Phantoms and Apaches hurtled down onto the
column and reduced it to charred wreckage. With the head of the column
destroyed and blocking the road, the remainder could escape neither forward nor
backward, and because of the cut in the ridge could not leave the road. Many
died in that column and the rest surrendered. By sundown, the first Arab forces
were entering Kuwait to liberate it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That evening, Mike Martin made contact again with Riyadh
and heard the news. He gave his position and that of a reasonably flat meadow
nearby.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The SAS men and Walker were out of food,
melting snow to drink, and bitterly cold, not daring to light a fire in case it
gave away their position. The war was over, but the patrols of mountain guards
might well not know that, or care.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just after dawn, two long-range Blackhawk
helicopters loaned by the American 101st Airborne Division came for them. They
came from the fire base camp set up by the 101st fifty miles inside Iraq, after
the biggest helicopter assault in history. So great was the distance from the
Saudi border that even from the fire base on the Euphrates River, it was a long
haul to the mountains near Khanaqin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That was why there were two of them: The second
had even more fuel for the journey home.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To be on the safe side, eight Eagles circled
above, giving protective cover as the refueling in the meadow was carried out.
Don Walker squinted upward.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hey, they’re my guys!” he shouted. As the two
Blackhawks clattered the way back again, the Strike Eagles rode shotgun until
they were south of the border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>They said farewell to each other on a
wind-blasted strip of sand, surrounded by the detritus of a defeated army near
the Saudi-Iraqi border. The whirling blades of a Blackhawk whipped up the dust
and gravel before taking Don Walker to Dhahran and a flight back to Al Kharz. A
British Puma stood farther away, to take the SAS men to their own secret
cordoned base.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>That evening, at a comfortable country house in the
rolling downs of Sussex, Dr. Terry Martin was told where his brother had
actually been since October and that he was now out of Iraq and safe in Saudi
Arabia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Martin was almost ill with relief, and the SIS
gave him a lift back to London, where he resumed his life as a lecturer at the
School of Oriental and African Studies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Two days later, on March 3, the commanders of the
Coalition forces met in a tent on a small and bare Iraqi airstrip called Safwan
with two generals from Baghdad to negotiate the surrender.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The only spokesmen for the Allied side were
Generals Norman Schwarzkopf and Prince Khaled bin Sultan. At the American
general’s side sat the commander of the British forces, General Sir Peter de la
Billière.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Both the Western officers to this day believe
that only two Iraqi generals came to Safwan. In fact, there were three.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The American security net was extremely tight,
to exclude the possibility of any assassin reaching the tent in which the opposing
generals met. An entire American division encircled the airfield, facing
outward.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Unlike the Allied commanders who had arrived
from the south by a series of helicopters, the Iraqi party had been ordered to
drive to a road junction north of the airstrip. There they left their cars to
transfer to a number of American armored personnel vehicles called humvees and
be driven by U.S. drivers the last two miles to the airstrip and the cluster of
tents where they were awaited.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Ten minutes after the party of generals entered
the negotiation tent with their interpreters, another black Mercedes limousine
was coming down the Basra road toward the junction. The roadblock there was
commanded by that time by a captain of the U.S. Seventh Armored Brigade, all
more senior officers having proceeded to the airstrip. The unexpected limousine
was at once stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the back of the car was the third Iraqi
general, albeit only a brigadier, bearing a black attaché case. Neither he nor
his driver spoke English, and the captain spoke no Arabic. He was about to
radio the airstrip for orders when a jeep driven by an American colonel and
bearing another in the passenger seat pulled up. The driver was in the uniform
of the Green Beret Special Forces; the passenger had the insignia of G2, the
military intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Both men flashed their ID at the captain, who
examined the cards, recognized their authenticity, and threw up a salute.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“It’s okay, Captain. We’ve been expecting this
bastard,” said the Green Beret colonel. “Seems he was delayed by a flat tire.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“That case,” said the G2 officer, pointing at
the attaché case of the Iraqi brigadier who now stood uncomprehending by the
side of his car, “contains the names of all our POWs, including the missing
aircrew. Stormin’ Norman wants it, and now.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were no humvees left. The Green Beret
colonel gave the Iraqi a rough shove toward the jeep. The captain was
perplexed. He knew nothing of any third Iraqi general. He also knew his unit
had recently gotten into the Bear’s bad books by having claimed to occupy
Safwan when it had not achieved that objective. The last thing he needed was to
call down more of General Schwarzkopf’s wrath on the Seventh Armored by
detaining the list of missing American aircrew. The jeep drove away in the
direction of Safwan. The captain shrugged and gestured the Iraqi driver to park
with all the others.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>On the road to the airstrip the jeep passed
between rows of parked American armored vehicles for up to a mile. Then there
was an empty section of road, before the cordon of Apache helicopters
surrounding the actual negotiation area.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Clear of the tanks, the G2 colonel turned to
the Iraqi and spoke in good Arabic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Under your seat,” he said. “Don’t get out of
the jeep, but get them on—fast.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iraqi wore the dark green uniform of his
country. The rolled clothes beneath his seat were in the light tan of a colonel
of the Saudi Special Forces. He quickly exchanged trousers, jacket, and beret.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Just before the ring of Apaches on the tarmac,
the jeep peeled away into the desert, skirted the airstrip, and drove on south.
On the far side of Safwan, the vehicle regained the main road to Kuwait, twenty
miles away.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The U.S. tanks were on every side, facing
outward. Their job was to forbid the penetration of any infiltrators. Their commanders,
atop their turrets, watched one of their own jeeps bearing two of their own
colonels and a Saudi officer drive out of the perimeter and away from the
protected zone, so it did not concern them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It took the jeep almost an hour to reach the
Kuwait airport, then a devastated wreck, gutted by the Iraqis and covered by a
black pall of smoke from the oil field fires blazing all over the emirate. The
journey took so long because, to avoid the carnage of the Mutla Ridge road, it
had diverted in a big sweep through the desert west of the city.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Five miles short of the airport, the G2 colonel
took a hand-communicator from the glove compartment and keyed in a series of <i>bleeps</i>.
Over the airport a single airplane began its approach.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The makeshift airport control tower was a
trailer manned by Americans. The incoming aircraft was a British Aerospace
HS-125. Not only that, it was the personal airplane of the British Commander,
General de la Billière. It must have been; it had all the right markings and
the right call-sign. The air traffic controller cleared it to land.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The HS-125 did not taxi to the wreckage of the
airport building but to a distant dispersal point, where it made rendezvous
with an American jeep. The door opened, the ladder came down, and three men boarded
the twin-jet.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Granby One, clearance for takeoff,” the
traffic controller heard. He was handling an incoming Canadian Hercules with
medicines for the hospital on board.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Hold, Granby One. ... What is your flight
plan?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He meant: That was damn fast—where the hell do
you think you’re going?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Sorry, Kuwait Tower.” The voice was clipped
and precise, pure Royal Air Force. The controller had heard the RAF before, and
they all sounded the same—preppy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Kuwait Tower, we’ve just taken on board a
colonel of the Saudi Special Forces. Feeling very sick. One of the staff of
Prince Khaled. General Schwarzkopf asked for his immediate evacuation, so Sir
Peter offered his-own plane. Clearance takeoff, please, old boy.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In two breaths the British pilot had mentioned
one general, one prince, and one knight of the realm. The controller was a
master sergeant, and good at his job. He had a fine career in the United States
Air Force. Refusing to evacuate a sick Saudi colonel on the staff of a prince
at the request of a general in the plane of the British commander might not do
that career any good.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Granby One, clear takeoff,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The HS-125 lifted away from Kuwait, but instead
of heading for Riyadh, which has one of the finest hospitals in the Middle
East, it set course due west along the kingdom’s northern border.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The ever-alert AWACS saw it and called up,
asking for its destination. This time the pukka British voice came back
explaining that they were flying to the British base at Akrotiri in Cyprus to
evacuate back home a close friend and fellow officer of General de la Billière
who had been badly wounded by a land mine. The mission commander in the AWACS
knew nothing of this, but wondered how exactly he should object. Have it shot
down?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Fifteen minutes later, the HS-125 left Saudi
air space and crossed the border of Jordan.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Iraqi sitting in the back of the executive
jet knew nothing of all this but was impressed by the efficiency of the British
and Americans. He had been dubious on receiving the last message from his
paymasters in the West, but on reflection he agreed it would be wise to quit
now rather than wait for later and have to do it on his own, without help. The
plan outlined to him in that message had worked like a dream.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>One of the two pilots in RAF tropical uniforms
came back from the flight deck and muttered in English to the American G2
colonel, who grinned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Welcome to freedom, Brigadier,” he said in
Arabic to his guest. “We are out of Saudi air space. Soon we’ll have you in an
airliner to America. By the way, I have something for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He withdrew a slip of paper from his breast
pocket and showed it to the Iraqi, who read it with great pleasure. It was a
simple total: the sum lodged in his bank account in Vienna, now over $10
million.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Green Beret reached into a locker and
produced several glasses and a collection of miniatures of Scotch. He poured
one bottle into each glass and passed them around.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Well, my friend, to retirement and prosperity.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He drank; the other American drank. The Iraqi
smiled and drank.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>“Have a rest,” said the G2 colonel in Arabic. “We’ll
be there in less than an hour.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>After that, they left him alone. He leaned his
head back onto the cushion of his seat and let his mind drift back over the
past twenty weeks mat had made his fortune.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had taken great risks, but they had paid
off. He recalled the day he had sat in that conference room in the Presidential
Palace and heard the Rais announce that at last Iraq possessed, in the nick of
time, her own nuclear bomb. That had come as a genuine shock, as had the sudden
cut-off of all communications after he had told the Americans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Then they had suddenly come back, more
insistent than ever, demanding to know where the device was stored.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He had not had the faintest idea, but for the
offered bounty of $5 million, it had clearly been the time to stake everything.
Then it had been easier than he could have imagined.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The wretched nuclear engineer, Dr. Salah
Siddiqi, had been picked up on the streets of Baghdad and accused, amid the sea
of his own pain, of betraying the location of the device. Protesting his
innocence, he had given away the site of Al Qubai and the camouflage of the car
junkyard. How could the scientist have known that he was being interrogated
three days before the bombing, not two days after it?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Jericho’s next shock had been to learn of the
shooting down of the two British fliers. That had not been foreseen. He
desperately needed to know whether, in their briefing, they had been given any
indication as to how the information had arrived in the hands of the Allies.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His relief, when it became plain they knew
nothing beyond their brief and that as far as they knew the place might be a
store of artillery ammunition, had been short-lived, when the Rais insisted
there must have been a traitor. From then on Dr. Siddiqi, chained in a cell
beneath the Gymnasium, had had to be dispatched, which he was with a massive
injection of air into the heart, causing a coronary embolism.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The records of the time of his interrogation,
from three days before the bombing to two days after it, had been duly changed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But the greatest of all the shocks had been to
learn that the Allies had missed, that the bomb had been removed to some hidden
place called Qa’ala, the Fortress. What fortress? Where?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A chance remark by the nuclear engineer before
he died had revealed that the ace of camouflage was a certain Colonel Osman
Badri of the Engineers, but a check of records showed the young officer was a
passionate fan of the President. How to change that view?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The answer lay in the arrest on trumped-up
charges and messy murder of his much-loved father. After that, the
disillusioned Badri had been putty in Jericho’s hands, during the meeting in
the back of the car following the funeral.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The man called Jericho, also nicknamed Mu’azib
the Tormentor, felt at peace with the world. A drowsy numbness crept over him,
the effect perhaps of the strain of the past few days. He tried to move but
found his limbs would not function. The two American colonels were looking down
at him, talking in a language he could not understand but knew was not English.
He tried to respond but his mouth would not frame any words.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The HS-125 had turned southwest, dropping
across the Jordanian coast and down to ten thousand feet. Over the Gulf of
Aqaba the Green Beret pulled back the passenger door, and a rushing torrent of
air filled the cabin, even though the twin-jet had slowed almost to the point
of stall.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The two colonels eased him up, unprotesting,
limp and helpless, trying to say something but unable to. Over the blue water
south of Aqaba, Brigadier Omar Khatib left the airplane and plunged to the
water, there to break apart on impact. The sharks did the rest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The HS-125 turned north, passed over Eilat
after reentering Israeli air space, finally landing at Sde Dov, the military
airfield north of Tel Aviv. There the two pilots stripped off their British
uniforms and the colonels their American dress. All four returned to their
habitual Israeli ranks. The executive jet was stripped of its Royal Air Force
livery, repainted as it used to be, and returned to the air charter <i>sayan</i>
in Cyprus who had loaned it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The money from Vienna was transferred first to
the Kanoo Bank in Bahrain, then on to another in the United States. Part was
retransferred to the Hapoalim Bank in Tel Aviv and returned to the Israeli
government; it was what Israel had paid Jericho until the transfer to the CIA.
The balance, over $8 million, went into what the Mossad calls The Fun Fund.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Five days after the war ended, two more long-range
American helicopters returned to the valleys of the Hamreen. They asked no
permission and sought no approval.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The body of the Strike Eagle’s weapons systems
officer. Lieutenant Tim Nathanson, was never found. The Guards had torn it
apart with their machine-gun bursts, and the jackals, foxes, crows, and kites
had done the rest.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>To this day his bones must lie somewhere in
those cold valleys, not a hundred miles from where his forefathers once toiled
and wept by the waters of Babylon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>His father received the news in Washington, sat
shiva for him and said <i>kaddish</i>, and grieved alone in the mansion in
Georgetown.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The body of Corporal Kevin Norm <i>was </i>recovered.
As Blackhawks stood by, British hands tore apart the cairn and recovered the
corporal, who was put in a body bag and flown first to Riyadh and thence home
to England in a Hercules transport.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the middle of April a brief ceremony was
held at the SAS headquarters camp on the outskirts of Hereford.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There is no graveyard for the SAS; no cemetery
collects their dead. Many of them lie in fifty foreign battlefields whose very
names are unknown to most.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Some are under the sands of the Libyan Desert,
where they fell fighting Rommel in 1941 and 1942. Others are among the Greek
islands, the Abruzzi mountains, the Jura, and the Vosges. They lie scattered in
Malaysia and Borneo, in Yemen, Muscat and Oman, in jungles and freezing wastes
and beneath the cold waters of the Atlantic off the Falklands.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>When bodies were recovered, they came home to
Britain, but always to be handed to the families for burial. Even then, no
headstone ever mentions the SAS, for the regiment accredited is the original
unit from which the soldier came to the SAS—Fusiliers, Paras, Guards, whatever.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There is only one monument. In the heart of the
Stirling Lines at Hereford stands a short and stocky tower, clad in wood and
painted a dull chocolate brown. At its peak a clock keeps the hours, so the
edifice is known simply as the Clocktower.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Around its base are sheets of dull bronze, on
which are etched all the names and the places where they died.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>That April, there were five new names to be
unveiled. One had been shot by the Iraqis in captivity, two killed in a
firefight as they tried to slip back over the Saudi border. A fourth had died
of hypothermia after days in soaking clothes and freezing weather. The fifth
was Corporal Kevin North.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There were several former commanders of the
regiment there, that day in the rain. John Simpson came, and Viscount Johnny
Slim and Sir Peter. The Director of Special Forces, J. P. Lovat was there, and
Colonel Bruce Craig, then the CO. And Major Mike Martin and a few others.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because they were now at home, those still
serving could wear the rarely seen sand-colored beret with its emblem of the
winged dagger and the motto “Who Dares Wins.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not a long ceremony. The officers and
men saw the fabric pulled aside, the newly etched names stood out bold and
white against the bronze. They saluted and left to walk back to the various
mess buildings.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Shortly after, Mike Martin went to his small
hatchback car in the park, drove out through the guarded gates, and turned
toward the cottage he still kept in a village in the hills of Herefordshire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>He thought as he drove of all the things that
had happened in the streets and sands of Kuwait; and in the skies above; and in
the alleys and bazaars of Baghdad; and in the hills of the Hamreen. Because he
was a secretive man, he was glad at least of one thing: That no one would ever
know.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc6942775">A Final Note</a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>All wars must teach lessons. If they do not do so, they
were fought in vain and those who died in them did so for naught.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Gulf War taught two clear lessons, if the
powers have the wit to learn them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first is that it is madness for the thirty
most industrially developed nations of the world, who dispose between them of
ninety-five percent of high-tech weaponry and the means for its production, to
sell these artifacts to the crazed, the aggressive, and the dangerous for
short-term financial profit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For a decade the regime of the Republic of Iraq
was allowed to arm itself to a frightening level by a combination of political
foolishness, bureaucratic blindness, and corporate greed. The eventual
destruction, in part, of that war machine cost vastly more than its provision.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>A recurrence could easily be prevented by the
establishment of a central register of all exports to certain regimes, with
draconian penalties for nondisclosure. Analysts able to examine the broad
picture would soon see, by the type and quantity of materials ordered or
delivered, whether weapons of mass destruction were in preparation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The alternative will be a proliferation of
high-tech weaponry that will make the years of the cold war seem like an age of
peace and tranquillity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The second lesson concerns the gathering of
information. At the end of the cold war, many hoped this could safely be
curbed. The reality shows the opposite.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>During the 1970s and 1980s technical advances
in the gathering of electronic and signals intelligence were so impressive that
governments of the Free World were led to believe, as the scientists produced
their expensive miracles, that machines alone could do the job. The role of “humint,”
the gathering of information by people, was downgraded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the Gulf War the full panoply of Western technical
wizardry was brought to bear and, partly because of its impressive cost,
presumed to be virtually infallible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It was not. With a combination of skill,
ingenuity, guile, and hard work, large parts of Iraq’s arsenal and the means of
its production had been hidden or so disguised that the machines could not see
them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pilots flew with great courage and skill,
but often they too were deceived by the cunning of those who had devised the
replicas and the camouflage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The fact that germ warfare, poison gas, or the
nuclear possibility was never employed was, like the outcome of the Battle of
Waterloo, “a damn close-run thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>What became plain by the end was that for
certain tasks in certain places, there is still no substitute for the oldest
information-gathering device on earth: the human eyeball, Mark One.</p>
