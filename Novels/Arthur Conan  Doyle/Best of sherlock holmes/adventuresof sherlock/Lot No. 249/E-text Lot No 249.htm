      <P>O</B></FONT><FONT size=3>f the dealings of Edward Bellingham with 
      William Monkhouse Lee, and of the cause of the great terror of Abercrombie 
      Smith, it may be that no absolute and final judgment will ever be 
      delivered. It is true that we have the full and clear narrative of Smith 
      himself, and such corroboration as he could look for from Thomas Styles 
      the servant, from the Reverend Plumptree Peterson, Fellow of Old's, and 
      from such other people as chanced to gain some passing glance at this or 
      that incident in a singular chain of events. Yet, in the main, the story 
      must rest upon Smith alone, and the most will think that it is more likely 
      that one brain, however outwardly sane, has some subtle warp in its 
      texture, some strange flaw in its workings, than that the path of Nature 
      has been overstepped in open day in so famed a centre of learning and 
      light as the University of Oxford. Yet when we think how narrow and how 
      devious this path of Nature is, how dimly we can trace it, for all our 
      lamps of science, and how from the darkness which girds it round great and 
      terrible ossibilities loom ever shadowly upwards, it is a bold and 
      confident man who will put a limit to the strange by-paths into which the 
      human spirit may wander.</P>
      <P>In a certain wing of what we will call Old College in Oxford there is a 
      corner turret of an exceeding great age. The heavy arch which spans the 
      open door has bent downwards in the centre under the weight of its years, 
      and the grey, lichen-blotched blocks of stone are bound and knitted 
      together with withes and strands of ivy, as though the old mother had set 
      herself to brace them up against wind and weather. From the door a stone 
      stair curves upward spirally, passing two landings, and terminating in a 
      third one, its steps all shapeless and hollowed by the tread of so many 
      generations of the seekers after knowledge. Life has flowed like water 
      down this winding stair, and, waterlike, has left these smooth-worn 
      grooves behind it. From the long-gowned, pedantic scholars of Plantagenet 
      days down to the young bloods of a later age, how full and strong had been 
      that tide of young, English life. And what was left now of all those 
      hopes, those strivings, those fiery energies, save here and there in some 
      old-world churchyard a few scratches upon a stone, and perchance a handful 
      of dust in a mouldering coffin? Yet here were the silent stair and the 
      grey, old wall, with bend and saltire and many another heraldic device 
      still to be read upon its surface, like grotesque shadows thrown back from 
      the days that had passed.</P>
      <P>In the month of May, in the year 1884, three young men occupied the 
      sets of rooms which opened on to the separate landings of the old stair. 
      Each set consisted simply of a sitting-room and of a bedroom, while the 
      two corresponding rooms upon the ground-floor were used, the one as a 
      coal-cellar, and the other as the living-room of the servant, or scout, 
      Thomas Styles, whose duty it was to wait upon the three men above him. To 
      right and to left was a line of lecture-rooms and of offices, so that the 
      dwellers in the old turret enjoyed a certain seclusion, which made the 
      chambers popular among the more studious undergraduates. Such were the 
      three who occupied them now—Abercrombie Smith above, Edward Bellingham 
      beneath him and William Monkhouse Lee upon the lowest storey.</P>
      <P>It was ten o'clock on a bright, spring night, and Abercrombie Smith lay 
      back in his arm-chair, his feet upon the fender, and his briar-root pipe 
      between his lips. In a similar chair, and equally at his ease, there 
      lounged on the other side of the fireplace his old school friend Jephro 
      Hastie. Both men were in flannels, for they had spent their evening upon 
      the river, but apart from their dress no one could look at their hard-cut, 
      alert faces without seeing that they were open-air men—men whose minds and 
      tastes turned naturally to all that was manly and robust. Hastie, indeed, 
      was stroke of his college boat, and Smith was an even better oar, but a 
      coming examination had already cast its shadow over him and held him to 
      his work, save for the few hours a week which health demanded. A litter of 
      medical books upon the table, with scattered bones, models, and anatomical 
      plates, pointed to the extent as well as the nature of his studies, while 
      a couple of single-sticks and a set of boxing-gloves above the mantelpiece 
      hinted at the means by which, with Hastie's help, he might take his 
      exercise in its most compressed and least-distant form. They knew each 
      other very well—so well that they could sit now in that soothing silence 
      which is the very highest development of companionship.</P>
      <P>"Have some whisky," said Abercrombie Smith at last between two 
      cloudbursts. "Scotch in the jug and Irish in the bottle."</P>
      <P>"No, thanks. I'm in for the sculls. I don't liquor when I'm training. 
      How about you?"</P>
      <P>"I'm reading hard. I think it best to leave it alone."</P>
      <P>Hastie nodded, and they relapsed into a contented silence.</P>
      <P>"By the way, Smith," asked Hastie, presently, "have you made the 
      acquaintance of either of the fellows on your stair yet?"</P>
      <P>"Just a nod when we pass. Nothing more."</P>
      <P>"Hum! I should be inclined to let it stand at that. I know something of 
      them both. Not much, but as much as I want. I don't think I should take 
      them to my bosom if I were you. Not that there's much amiss with Monkhouse 
      Lee."</P>
      <P>"Meaning the thin one?"</P>
      <P>"Precisely. He is a gentlemanly little fellow. I don't think there is 
      any vice in him. But then you can't know him without knowing 
      Bellingham."</P>
      <P>"Meaning the fat one?"</P>
      <P>"Yes, the fat one. And he's a man whom I, for one, would rather not 
      know."</P>
      <P>Abercrombie Smith raised his eyebrows and glanced across at his 
      companion.</P>
      <P>"What's up, then?" he asked. "Drink? Cards? Cad? You used not to be 
      censorious."</P>
      <P>"Ah! you evidently don't know the man, or you wouldn't ask. There's 
      something damnable about him—something reptilian. My gorge always rises at 
      him. I should put him down as a man with secret vices —an evil liver. He's 
      no fool, though. They say that he is one of the best men in his line that 
      they have ever had in the college."</P>
      <P>"Medicine or classics?"</P>
      <P>"Eastern languages. He's a demon at them. Chillingworth met him 
      somewhere above the second cataract last long, and he told me that he just 
      prattled to the Arabs as if he had been born and nursed and weaned among 
      them. He talked Coptic to the Copts, and Hebrew to the Jews, and Arabic to 
      the Bedouins, and they were all ready to kiss the hem of his frock-coat. 
      There are some old hermit Johnnies up in those parts who sit on rocks and 
      scowl and spit at the casual stranger. Well, when they saw this chap 
      Bellingham, before he had said five words they just lay down on their 
      bellies and wriggled. Chillingworth said that he never saw anything like 
      it. Bellingham seemed to take it as his right, too, and strutted about 
      among them and talked down to them like a Dutch uncle. Pretty good for an 
      undergrad. of Old's, wasn't it?"</P>
      <P>"Why do you say you can't know Lee without knowing Bellingham?"</P>
      <P>"Because Bellingham is engaged to his sister Eveline. Such a bright 
      little girl, Smith! I know the whole family well. It's disgusting to see 
      that brute with her. A toad and a dove, that's what they always remind me 
      of."</P>
      <P>Abercrombie Smith grinned and knocked his ashes out against the side of 
      the grate.</P>
      <P>"You show every card in your hand, old chap," said he. "What a 
      prejudiced, green-eyed, evil-thinking old man it is! You have really 
      nothing against the fellow except that."</P>
      <P>"Well, I've known her ever since she was as long as that cherry-wood 
      pipe, and I don't like to see her taking risks. And it is a risk. He looks 
      beastly. And he has a beastly temper, a venomous temper. You remember his 
      row with Long Norton?"</P>
      <P>"No; you always forget that I am a freshman."</P>
      <P>"Ah, it was last winter. Of course. Well, you know the towpath along by 
      the river. There were several fellows going along it, Bellingham in front, 
      when they came on an old market-woman coming the other way. It had been 
      raining—you know what those fields are like when it has rained—and the 
      path ran between the river and a great puddle that was nearly as broad. 
      Well, what does this swine do but keep the path, and push the old girl 
      into the mud, where she and her marketings came to terrible grief. It was 
      a blackguard thing to do, and Long Norton, who is as gentle a fellow as 
      ever stepped, told him what he thought of it. One word led to another, and 
      it ended in Norton laying his stick across the fellow's shoulders. There 
      was the deuce of a fuss about it, and it's a treat to see the way in which 
      Bellingham looks at Norton when they meet now. By Jove, Smith, it's nearly 
      eleven o'clock!"</P>
      <P>"No hurry. Light your pipe again."</P>
      <P>"Not I. I'm supposed to be in training. Here I've been sitting 
      gossiping when I ought to have been safely tucked up. I'll borrow your 
      skull, if you can share it. Williams has had mine for a month. I'll take 
      the little bones of your ear, too, if you are sure you won't need them. 
      Thanks very much. Never mind a bag, I can carry them very well under my 
      arm. Good night, my son, and take my tip as to your neighbour."</P>
      <P>When Hastie, bearing his anatomical plunder, had clattered off down the 
      winding stair, Abercrombie Smith hurled his pipe into the wastepaper 
      basket, and drawing his chair nearer to the lamp, plunged into a 
      formidable, green-covered volume, adorned with great, coloured maps of 
      that strange, internal kingdom of which we are the hapless and helpless 
      monarchs. Though a freshman at Oxford, the student was not so in medicine, 
      for he had worked for four years at Glasgow and at Berlin, and this coming 
      examination would place him finally as a member of his profession. With 
      his firm mouth, broad forehead, and clear-cut, somewhat hard-featured 
      face, he was a man who, if he had no brilliant talent, was yet so dogged, 
      so patient, and so strong that he might in the end overtop a more showy 
      genius. A man who can hold his own among Scotchmen and North Germans is 
      not a man to be easily set back. Smith had left a name at Glasgow and at 
      Berlin, and he was bent now upon doing as much at Oxford, if hard work and 
      devotion could accomplish it.</P>
      <P>He had sat reading for about an hour, and the hands of the noisy 
      carriage clock upon the side-table were rapidly closing together upon the 
      twelve, when a sudden sound fell upon the student's ear—a sharp, rather 
      shrill sound, like the hissing intake of a man's breath who gasps under 
      some strong emotion. Smith laid down his book and slanted his ear to 
      listen. There was no one on either side or above him, so that the 
      interruption came certainly from the neighbour beneath—the same neighbour 
      of whom Hastie had given so unsavoury an account. Smith knew him only as a 
      flabby, pale-faced man of silent and studious habits, a man whose lamp 
      threw a golden bar from the old turret even after he had extinguished his 
      own. This community in lateness had formed a certain silent bond between 
      them. It was soothing to Smith when the hours stole on towards dawning to 
      feel that there was another so close who set as small a value upon his 
      sleep as he did. Even now, as his thoughts turned towards him, Smith's 
      feelings were kindly. </P>
      <P>Hastie was a good fellow, but he was rough, strong-fibred, with no 
      imagination or sympathy. He could not tolerate departures from what he 
      looked upon as the model type of manliness. If a man could not be measured 
      by a public-school standard, then he was beyond the pale with Hastie. Like 
      so many who are themselves robust, he was apt to confuse the constitution 
      with the character, to ascribe to want of principle what was really a want 
      of circulation. Smith, with his stronger mind, knew his friend's habit, 
      and made allowance for it now as his thoughts turned towards the man 
      beneath him.</P>
      <P>There was no return of the singular sound, and Smith was about to turn 
      to his work once more, when suddenly there broke out in the silence of the 
      night a hoarse cry, a positive scream—the call of a man who is moved and 
      shaken beyond all control. Smith sprang out of his chair and dropped his 
      book. He was a man of fairly firm fibre, but there was something in this 
      sudden, uncontrollable shriek of horror which chilled his blood and 
      pringled in his skin. Coming in such a place and at such an hour, it 
      brought a thousand fantastic possibilities into his head. Should he rush 
      down, or was it better to wait? He had all the national hatred of making a 
      scene, and he knew so little of his neighbour that he would not lightly 
      intrude upon his affairs. For a moment he stood in doubt and even as he 
      balanced the matter there was a quick rattle of footsteps upon the stairs, 
      and young Monkhouse Lee, half-dressed and as white as ashes, burst into 
      his room.</P>
      <P>"Come down!" he gasped. "Bellingham's ill."</P>
      <P>Abercrombie Smith followed him closely downstairs into the sitting-room 
      which was beneath his own, and intent as he was upon the matter in hand, 
      he, could not but take an amazed glance around him as he crossed the 
      threshold. It was such a chamber as he had never seen before—a museum 
      rather than a study. Walls and ceiling were thickly covered with a 
      thousand strange relics from Egypt and the East. Tall, angular figures 
      bearing burdens or weapons stalked in an uncouth frieze round the 
      apartments. Above were bull-headed, stork-headed, cat-headed, owl-headed 
      statues, with viper-crowned, almond-eyed monarchs, and strange, 
      beetle-like deities cut out of the blue Egyptian lapis lazuli. Horus and 
      Isis and Osiris peeped down from every niche and shelf, while across the 
      ceiling a true son of Old Nile, a great, hanging-jawed crocodile, was 
      slung in a double noose.</P>
      <P>In the centre of this singular chamber was a square table, littered 
      with papers, bottles, and the dried leaves of some graceful, palm-like 
      plant. These varied objects had all been heaped together in order to make 
      room for a mummy case, which had been conveyed from the wall, as was 
      evident from the gap there, and laid across the front of the table. The 
      mummy itself, a horrid, black, withered thing, like a charred head on a 
      gnarled bush, was lying half out of the case, with its claw-like hand and 
      bony forearm resting upon the table. Propped up against the sarcophagus 
      was an old, yellow scroll of papyrus, and in front of it, in a wooden 
      armchair, sat the owner of the room, his head thrown back, his widely 
      opened eyes directed in a horrified stare to the crocodile above him, and 
      his blue, thick lips puffing loudly with every expiration.</P>
      <P>"My God! he's dying!" cried Monkhouse Lee, distractedly.</P>
      <P>He was a slim, handsome young fellow, olive-skinned and dark-eyed, of a 
      Spanish rather than of an English type, with a Celtic intensity of manner 
      which contrasted with the Saxon phlegm of Abercrombie Smith.</P>
      <P>"Only a faint, I think," said the medical student. "Just give me a hand 
      with him. You take his feet. Now on to the sofa. Can you kick all those 
      little wooden devils off? What a litter it is! Now he will be all right if 
      we undo his collar and give him some water. What has he been up to at 
      all?"</P>
      <P>"I don't know. I heard him cry out. I ran up. I know him pretty well, 
      you know. It is very good of you to come down."</P>
      <P>"His heart is going like a pair of castanets," said Smith, laying his 
      hand on the breast of the unconscious man. "He seems to me to be 
      frightened all to pieces. Chuck the water over him! What a face he has got 
      on him!"</P>
      <P>It was indeed a strange and most repellent face, for colour and outline 
      were equally unnatural. It was white, not with the ordinary pallor of 
      fear, but with an absolutely bloodless white, like the under side of a 
      sole. He was very fat, but gave the impression of having at some time been 
      considerably fatter, for his skin hung loosely in creases and folds, and 
      was shot with a meshwork of wrinkles. Short, stubbly brown hair bristled 
      up from his scalp, with a pair of thick, wrinkled ears protruding at the 
      sides. His light-grey eyes were still open, the pupils dilated and the 
      balls projecting in a fixed and horrid stare. It seemed to Smith as he 
      looked down upon him that he had never seen Nature's danger signals flying 
      so plainly upon a man's countenance, and his thoughts turned more 
      seriously to the warning which Hastie had given him an hour before.</P>
      <P>"What the deuce can have frightened him so?" he asked.</P>
      <P>"It's the mummy."</P>
      <P>"The mummy? How, then?"</P>
      <P>"I don't know. It's beastly and morbid. I wish he would drop it. It's 
      the second fright he has given me. It was the same last winter. I found 
      him just like this, with that horrid thing in front of him."</P>
      <P>"What does he want with the mummy, then?"</P>
      <P>"Oh, he's a crank, you know. It's his hobby. He knows more about these 
      things than any man in England. But I wish he wouldn't. Ah, he's beginning 
      to come to."</P>
      <P>A faint tinge of colour had begun to steal back into Bellingham's 
      ghastly cheeks, and his eyelids shivered like a sail after a calm. He 
      clasped and unclasped his hands, drew a long, thin breath between his 
      teeth, and suddenly jerking up his head, threw a glance of recognition 
      around him. As his eyes fell upon the mummy, he sprang off the sofa, 
      seized the roll of papyrus, thrust it into a drawer, turned the key, and 
      then staggered back on to the sofa.</P>
      <P>"What 's up?" he asked. "What do you chaps want?"</P>
      <P>"You've been shrieking out and making no end of a fuss," said Monkhouse 
      Lee. "If our neighbour here from above hadn't come down, I'm sure I don't 
      know what I should have done with you."</P>
      <P>"Ah, it's Abercrombie Smith," said Bellingham, glancing up at him. "How 
      very good of you to come in! What a fool I am! Oh, my God, what a fool I 
      am!"</P>
      <P>He sank his head on to his hands, and burst into peal after peal of 
      hysterical laughter.</P>
      <P>"Look here! Drop it!" cried Smith, shaking him roughly by the 
      shoulder.</P>
      <P>"Your nerves are all in a jangle. You must drop these little midnight 
      games with mummies, or you'll be going off your chump. You're all on wires 
      now."</P>
      <P>"I wonder," said Bellingham, "whether you would be as cool as I am if 
      you had seen——"</P>
      <P>"What then?"</P>
      <P>"Oh, nothing. I meant that I wonder if you could sit up at night with a 
      mummy without trying your nerves. I have no doubt that you are quite 
      right. I dare say that I have been taking it out of myself too much 
      lately. But I am all right now. Please don't go, though. Just wait for a 
      few minutes until I am quite myself."</P>
      <P>"The room is very close," remarked Lee, throwing open the window and 
      letting in the cool night air.</P>
      <P>"It's balsamic resin," said Bellingham. He lifted up one of the dried 
      palmate leaves from the table and frizzled it over the chimney of the 
      lamp. It broke away into heavy smoke wreaths, and a pungent, biting odour 
      filled the chamber. "It's the sacred plant—the plant of the priests," he 
      remarked. "Do you know anything of Eastern languages, Smith?"</P>
      <P>"Nothing at all. Not a word."</P>
      <P>The answer seemed to lift a weight from the Egyptologist's mind.</P>
      <P>"By the way," he continued, "how long was it from the time that you ran 
      down, until I came to my senses?"</P>
      <P>"Not long. Some four or five minutes."</P>
      <P>"I thought it could not be very long," said he, drawing a long breath. 
      "But what a strange thing unconsciousness is! There is no measurement to 
      it. I could not tell from my own sensations if it were seconds or weeks. 
      Now that gentleman on the table was packed up in the days of the eleventh 
      dynasty, some forty centuries ago, and yet if he could find his tongue, he 
      would tell us that this lapse of time has been but a closing of the eyes 
      and a reopening of them. He is a singularly fine mummy, Smith."</P>
      <P>Smith stepped over to the table and looked down with a professional eye 
      at the black and twisted form in front of him. The features, though 
      horribly discoloured, were perfect, and two little nut-like eyes still 
      lurked in the depths of the black, hollow sockets. The blotched skin was 
      drawn tightly from bone to bone, and a tangled wrap of black, coarse hair 
      fell over the ears. Two thin teeth, like those of a rat, overlay the 
      shrivelled lower lip. In its crouching position, with bent joints and 
      craned head, there was a suggestion of energy about the horrid thing which 
      made Smith's gorge rise. The gaunt ribs, with their parchment-like 
      covering, were exposed, and the sunken, leaden-hued abdomen, with the long 
      slit where the embalmer had left his mark; but the lower limbs were 
      wrapped round with coarse, yellow bandages. A number of little clove-like 
      pieces of myrrh and of cassia were sprinkled over the body, and lay 
      scattered on the inside of the case.</P>
      <P>"I don't know his name," said Bellingham, passing his hand over the 
      shrivelled head. "You see the outer sarcophagus with the inscriptions is 
      missing. Lot 249 is all the title he has now. You see it printed on his 
      case. That was his number in the auction at which I picked him up."</P>
      <P>"He has been a very pretty sort of fellow in his day," remarked 
      Abercrombie Smith.</P>
      <P>"He has been a giant. His mummy is six feet seven in length, and that 
      would be a giant over there, for they were never a very robust race. Feel 
      these great, knotted bones, too. He would be a nasty fellow to 
tackle."</P>
      <P>"Perhaps these very hands helped to build the stones into the 
      pyramids," suggested Monkhouse Lee, looking down with disgust in his eyes 
      at the crooked, unclean talons.</P>
      <P>"No fear. This fellow has been pickled in natron, and looked after in 
      the most approved style. They did not serve hodsmen in that fashion. Salt 
      or bitumen was enough for them. It has been calculated that this sort of 
      thing cost about seven hundred and thirty pounds in our money. Our friend 
      was a noble at the least. What do you make of that small inscription near 
      his feet, Smith?"</P>
      <P>"I told you that I know no Eastern tongue."</P>
      <P>"Ah, so you did. It is the name of the embalmer, I take it. A very 
      conscientious worker he must have been. I wonder how many modern works 
      will survive four thousand years?"</P>
      <P>He kept on speaking lightly and rapidly, but it was evident to 
      Abercrombie Smith that he was still palpitating with fear. His hands 
      shook, his lower lip trembled and look where he would, his eye always came 
      sliding round to his gruesome companion. Through all his fear, however, 
      there was a suspicion of triumph in his tone and manner. His eyes shone, 
      and his footstep, as he paced the room, was brisk and jaunty. He gave the 
      impression of a man who has gone through an ordeal, the marks of which he 
      still bears upon him, but which has helped him to his end.</P>
      <P>"You're not going yet?" he cried, as Smith rose from the sofa.</P>
      <P>At the prospect of solitude, his fears seemed to crowd back upon him, 
      and he stretched out a hand to detain him.</P>
      <P>"Yes, I must go. I have my work to do. You are all right now. I think 
      that with your nervous system you should take up some less morbid 
      study."</P>
      <P>"Oh, I am not nervous as a rule; and I have unwrapped mummies 
      before."</P>
      <P>"You fainted last time," observed Monkhouse Lee.</P>
      <P>"Ah, yes, so I did. Well, I must have a nerve tonic or a course of 
      electricity. You are not going, Lee?"</P>
      <P>"I'll do whatever you wish, Ned."</P>
      <P>"Then I'll come down with you and have a shakedown on your sofa. Good 
      night, Smith. I am so sorry to have disturbed you with my 
foolishness."</P>
      <P>They shook hands, and as the medical student stumbled up the spiral and 
      irregular stair he heard a key turn in a door, and the steps of his two 
      new acquaintances as they descended to the lower floor.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>In this strange way began the acquaintance between Edward Bellingham 
      and Abercrombie Smith, an acquaintance which the latter, at least, had no 
      desire to push further. Bellingham, however, appeared to have taken a 
      fancy to his rough-spoken neighbour, and made his advances in such a way 
      that he could hardly be repulsed without absolute brutality. Twice he 
      called to thank Smith for his assistance, and many times afterwards he 
      looked in with books, papers and such other civilities as two bachelor 
      neighbours can offer each other. He was, as Smith soon found, a man of 
      wide reading, with catholic tastes and an extraordinary memory. His 
      manner, too, was so pleasing and suave that one came, after a time, to 
      overlook his repellent appearance. For a jaded and wearied man he was no 
      unpleasant companion, and Smith found himself, after a time, looking 
      forward to his visits, and even returning them.</P>
      <P>Clever as he undoubtedly was, however, the medical student seemed to 
      detect a dash of insanity in the man. He broke out at times into a high, 
      inflated style of talk which was in contrast with the simplicity of his 
      life.</P>
      <P>"It is a wonderful thing," he cried, "to feel that one can command 
      powers of good and of evil—a ministering angel or a demon of vengeance." 
      And again, of Monkhouse Lee, he said,—"Lee is a good fellow, an honest 
      fellow, but he is without strength or ambition. He would not make a fit 
      partner for a man with a great enterprise. He would not make a fit partner 
      for me."</P>
      <P>At such hints and innuendoes stolid Smith, puffing solemnly at his 
      pipe, would simply raise his eyebrows and shake his head, with little 
      interjections of medical wisdom as to earlier hours and fresher air.</P>
      <P>One habit Bellingham had developed of late which Smith knew to be a 
      frequent herald of a weakening mind. He appeared to be for ever talking to 
      himself. At late hours of the night, when there could be no visitor with 
      him, Smith could still hear his voice beneath him in a low, muffled 
      monologue, sunk almost to a whisper, and yet very audible in the silence. 
      This solitary babbling annoyed and distracted the student, so that he 
      spoke more than once to his neighbour about it. Bellingham, however, 
      flushed up at the charge, and denied curtly that he had uttered a sound; 
      indeed, he showed more annoyance over the matter than the occasion seemed 
      to demand.</P>
      <P>Had Abercrombie Smith had any doubt as to his own ears he had not to go 
      far to find corroboration. Tom Styles, the little wrinkled man-servant who 
      had attended to the wants of the lodgers in the turret for a longer time 
      than any man's memory could carry him, was sorely put to it over the same 
      matter.</P>
      <P>"If you please, sir," said he, as he tidied down the top chamber one 
      morning, "do you think Mr. Bellingham is all right, sir?"</P>
      <P>"All right, Styles?"</P>
      <P>"Yes, sir. Right in his head, sir."</P>
      <P>"Why should he not be, then?"</P>
      <P>"Well, I don't know, sir. His habits has changed of late. He's not the 
      same man he used to be, though I make free to say that he was never quite 
      one of my gentlemen, like Mr. Hastie or yourself, sir. He's took to 
      talkin' to himself something awful. I wonder it don't disturb you. I don't 
      know what to make of him, sir."</P>
      <P>"I don't know what business it is of yours, Styles."</P>
      <P>"Well, I takes an interest, Mr. Smith. It may be forward of me, but I 
      can't help it. I feel sometimes as if I was mother and father to my young 
      gentlemen. It all falls on me when things go wrong and the relations come. 
      But Mr. Bellingham, sir. I want to know what it is that walks about his 
      room sometimes when he's out and when the door's locked on the 
      outside."</P>
      <P>"Eh? you're talking nonsense, Styles."</P>
      <P>"Maybe so, sir; but I heard it more'n once with my own ears."</P>
      <P>"Rubbish, Styles."</P>
      <P>"Very good, sir. You'll ring the bell if you want me."</P>
      <P>Abercrombie Smith gave little heed to the gossip of the old 
      man-servant, but a small incident occurred a few days later which left an 
      unpleasant effect upon his mind, and brought the words of Styles forcibly 
      to his memory.</P>
      <P>Bellingham had come up to see him late one night, and was entertaining 
      him with an interesting account of the rock tombs of Beni Hassan in Upper 
      Egypt, when Smith, whose hearing was remarkably acute, distinctly heard 
      the sound of a door opening on the landing below.</P>
      <P>"There's some fellow gone in or out of your room," he remarked.</P>
      <P>Bellingham sprang up and stood helpless for a moment, with the 
      expression of a man who is half-incredulous and half-afraid.</P>
      <P>"I surely locked it. I am almost positive that I locked it," he 
      stammered. "No one could have opened it."</P>
      <P>"Why, I hear someone coming up the steps now," said Smith.</P>
      <P>Bellingham rushed out through the door, slammed it loudly behind him, 
      and hurried down the stairs. About half-way down Smith heard him stop, and 
      thought he caught the sound of whispering. A moment later the door beneath 
      him shut, a key creaked in a lock, and Bellingham, with beads of moisture 
      upon his pale face, ascended the stairs once more, and re-entered the 
      room.</P>
      <P>"It's all right," he said, throwing himself down in a chair. "It was 
      that fool of a dog. He had pushed the door open. I don't know how I came 
      to forget to lock it."</P>
      <P>"I didn't know you kept a dog," said Smith, looking very thoughtfully 
      at the disturbed face of his companion.</P>
      <P>"Yes, I haven't had him long. I must get rid of him. He's a great 
      nuisance."</P>
      <P>"He must be, if you find it so hard to shut him up. I should have 
      thought that shutting the door would have been enough, without locking 
      it."</P>
      <P>"I want to prevent old Styles from letting him out. He's of some value, 
      you know, and it would be awkward to lose him."</P>
      <P>"I am a bit of a dog-fancier myself," said Smith, still gazing hard at 
      his companion from the corner of his eyes. "Perhaps you'll let me have a 
      look at it."</P>
      <P>"Certainly. But I am afraid it cannot be to-night; I have an 
      appointment. Is that clock right? Then I am a quarter of an hour late 
      already. You'll excuse me, I am sure."</P>
      <P>He picked up his cap and hurried from the room. In spite of his 
      appointment, Smith heard him re-enter his own chamber and lock his door 
      upon the inside.</P>
      <P>This interview left a disagreeable impression upon the medical 
      student's mind. Bellingham had lied to him, and lied so clumsily that it 
      looked as if he had desperate reasons for concealing the truth. Smith knew 
      that his neighbour had no dog. He knew, also, that the step which he had 
      heard upon the stairs was not the step of an animal. But if it were. not, 
      then what could it be? There was old Styles’ statement about the something 
      which used to pace the room at times when the owner was absent. Could it 
      be a woman? Smith rather inclined to the view. If so, it would mean 
      disgrace and expulsion to Bellingham if it were discovered by the 
      authorities, so that his anxiety and falsehoods might be accounted for. 
      And yet it was inconceivable that an undergraduate could keep a woman in 
      his rooms without being instantly detected. Be the explanation what it 
      might, there was something ugly about it, and Smith determined, as he 
      turned to his books, to discourage all further attempts at intimacy on the 
      part of his soft spoken and ill-favoured neighbour.</P>
      <P>But his work was destined to interruption that night. He had hardly 
      caught up the broken threads when a firm, heavy footfall came three steps 
      at a time from below, and Hastie, in blazer and flannels, burst into the 
      room.</P>
      <P>"Still at it!" said he, plumping down into his wonted arm-chair. "What 
      a chap you are to stew! I believe an earthquake might come and knock 
      Oxford into a cocked hat, and you would sit perfectly placid with your 
      books among the ruins. However, I won't bore you long. Three whiffs of 
      baccy, and I am off."</P>
      <P>"What's the news, then?" asked Smith, cramming a plug of bird's-eye 
      into his briar with his forefinger.</P>
      <P>"Nothing very much. Wilson made 70 for the freshmen against the eleven. 
      They say that they will play him instead of Buddicomb, for Buddicomb is 
      clean off colour. He used to be able to bowl a little, but it's nothing 
      but half-volleys and long hops now."</P>
      <P>"Medium right," suggested Smith, with the intense gravity which comes 
      upon a 'varsity man when he speaks of athletics.</P>
      <P>"Inclining to fast, with a work from leg. Comes with the arm about 
      three inches or so. He used to be nasty on a wet wicket. Oh, by the way, 
      have you heard about Long Norton?"</P>
      <P>"What's that?"</P>
      <P>"He's been attacked."</P>
      <P>"Attacked?"</P>
      <P>"Yes, just as he was turning out of the High Street, and within a 
      hundred yards of the gate of Old's."</P>
      <P>"But who——"</P>
      <P>"Ah, that's the rub! If you said ‘what,’ you would be more grammatical. 
      Norton swears that it was not human, and, indeed, from the scratches on 
      his throat, I should be inclined to agree with him."</P>
      <P>"What, then? Have we come down to spooks?"</P>
      <P>Abercrombie Smith puffed his scientific contempt. </P>
      <P>"Well, no; I don't think that is quite the idea, either. I am inclined 
      to think that if any showman has lost a great ape lately, and the brute is 
      in these parts, a jury would find a true bill against it. Norton passes 
      that way every night, you know, about the same hour. There's a tree that 
      hangs low over the path—the big elm from Rainy's garden. Norton thinks the 
      thing dropped on him out of the tree. Anyhow, he was nearly strangled by 
      two arms, which, he says, were as strong and as thin as steel bands. He 
      saw nothing; only those beastly arms that tightened and tightened on him. 
      He yelled his head nearly off, and a couple of chaps came running, and the 
      thing went over the wall like a cat. He never got a fair sight of it the 
      whole time. It gave Norton a shake up, I can tell you. I tell him it has 
      been as good as a change at the seaside for him."</P>
      <P>"A garrotter, most likely," said Smith.</P>
      <P>"Very possibly. Norton says not; but we don't mind what he says. The 
      garrotter had long nails, and was pretty smart at swinging himself over 
      walls. By the way, your beautiful neighbour would be pleased if he heard 
      about it. He had a grudge against Norton, and he's not a man, from what I 
      know of him, to forget his little debts. But hallo, old chap, what have 
      you got in your noddle?"</P>
      <P>"Nothing," Smith answered curtly.</P>
      <P>He had started in his chair, and the look had flashed over his face 
      which comes upon a man who is struck suddenly by some unpleasant idea.</P>
      <P>"You looked as if something I had said had taken you on the raw. By the 
      way, you have made the acquaintance of Master B. since I looked in last, 
      have you not? Young Monkhouse Lee told me something to that effect."</P>
      <P>"Yes; I know him slightly. He has been up here once or twice."</P>
      <P>"Well, you're big enough and ugly enough to take care of yourself. He's 
      not what I should call exactly a healthy sort of Johnny, though, no doubt, 
      he's very clever, and all that. But you'll soon find out for yourself. Lee 
      is all right; he's a very decent little fellow. Well, so long, old chap! I 
      row Mullins for the Vice-Chancellor's pot on Wednesday week, so mind you 
      come down, in case I don't see you before."</P>
      <P>Bovine Smith laid down his pipe and turned stolidly his books once 
      more. But with all the will in the world, he found it very hard to keep 
      his mind upon his work. It would slip away to brood upon the man beneath 
      him, and upon the little mystery which hung round his chambers. Then his 
      thoughts turned to this singular attack of which Hastie had spoken, and to 
      the grudge which Bellingham was said to owe the object of it. The two 
      ideas would persist in rising together in his mind, as though there were 
      some close and intimate connection between them. And yet the suspicion was 
      so dim and vague that it could not be put down in words.</P>
      <P>"Confound the chap!" cried Smith, as he shied his book on pathology 
      across the room. "He has spoiled my night's reading, and that's reason 
      enough, if there were no other, why I should steer clear of him in the 
      future."</P>
      <P>For ten days the medical student confined himself so closely to his 
      studies that he neither saw nor heard anything of either of the men 
      beneath him. At the hours when Bellingham had been accustomed to visit 
      him, he took care to sport his oak, and though he more than once heard a 
      knocking at his outer door, he resolutely refused to answer it. One 
      afternoon, however, he was descending the stairs when, just as he was 
      passing it, Bellingham's door flew open, and young Monkhouse Lee came out 
      with his eyes sparkling and a dark flush of anger upon his olive cheeks. 
      Close at his heels followed Bellingham, his fat, unhealthy face all 
      quivering with malignant passion.</P>
      <P>"You fool!" he hissed. "You'll be sorry."</P>
      <P>"Very likely," cried the other. "Mind what I say. It's off! I won't 
      hear of it!"</P>
      <P>"You've promised, anyhow."</P>
      <P>"Oh, I'll keep that! I won't speak. But I'd rather little Eva was in 
      her grave. Once for all, it's off. She'll do what I say. We don't want to 
      see you again."</P>
      <P>So much Smith could not avoid hearing, but he hurried on, for he had no 
      wish to be involved in their dispute. There had been a serious breach 
      between them, that was clear enough, and Lee was going to cause</P>
      <P>the engagement with his sister to be broken off. Smith thought of 
      Hastie's comparison of the toad and the dove, and was glad to think that 
      the matter was at an end. Bellingham's face when he was in a passion was 
      not pleasant to look upon. He was not a man to whom an innocent girl could 
      be trusted for life. As he walked, Smith wondered languidly what could 
      have caused the quarrel, and what the promise might be which Bellingham 
      had been so anxious that Monkhouse Lee should keep.</P>
      <P>It was the day of the sculling match between Hastie and Mullins, and a 
      stream of men were making their way down to the banks of the Isis. A May 
      sun was shining brightly, and the yellow path was barred with the black 
      shadows of the tall elm-trees. On either side the grey colleges lay back 
      from the road, the hoary old mothers of minds looking out from their high, 
      mullioned windows at the tide of young life which swept so merrily past 
      them. Black-clad tutors, prim officials, pale, reading men, brown-faced, 
      straw-hatted young athletes in white sweaters or many-coloured blazers, 
      all were hurrying towards the blue, winding river which curves through the 
      Oxford meadows.</P>
      <P>Abercrombie Smith, with the intuition of an old oarsman, chose his 
      position at the point where he knew that the struggle, if there were a 
      struggle, would come. Far off he heard the hum which announced the start, 
      the gathering roar of the approach, the thunder of running feet, and the 
      shouts of the men in the boats beneath him. A spray of half-clad, 
      deep-breathing runners shot past him, and craning over their shoulders, he 
      saw Hastie pulling a steady thirty-six, while his opponent, with a jerky 
      forty, was a good boat's length behind him. Smith gave a cheer for his 
      friend, and pulling out his watch, was starting off again for his 
      chambers, when he felt a touch upon his shoulder, and found that young 
      Monkhouse Lee was beside him.</P>
      <P>"I saw you there," he said, in a timid, deprecating way. "I wanted to 
      speak to you, if you could spare me a half-hour. This cottage is mine. I 
      share it with Harrington of King's. Come in and have a cup of tea."</P>
      <P>"I must be back presently," said Smith. "I am hard on the grind at 
      present. But I'll come in for a few minutes with pleasure. I wouldn't have 
      come out only Hastie is a friend of mine."</P>
      <P>"So he is of mine. Hasn't he a beautiful style? Mullins wasn't in it. 
      But come into the cottage. It's a little den of a place, but it is 
      pleasant to work in during the summer months."</P>
      <P>It was a small, square, white building, with green doors and shutters, 
      and a rustic trellis-work porch, standing back some fifty yards from the 
      river's bank. Inside, the main room was roughly fitted up as a study—deal 
      table, unpainted shelves with books, and a few cheap oleographs upon the 
      wall. A kettle sang upon a spirit-stove, and there were tea things upon a 
      tray on the table.</P>
      <P>"Try that chair and have a cigarette," said Lee. "Let me pour you out a 
      cup of tea. It's so good of you to come in, for I know that your time is a 
      good deal taken up. I wanted to say to you that, if I were you, I should 
      change my rooms at once."</P>
      <P>"Eh?"</P>
      <P>Smith sat staring with a lighted match in one hand and his unlit 
      cigarette in the other.</P>
      <P>"Yes; it must seem very extraordinary, and the worst of it is that I 
      cannot give my reasons, for I am under a solemn promise—a very solemn 
      promise. But I may go so far as to say that I don't think Bellingham is a 
      very safe man to live near. I intend to camp out here as much as I can for 
      a time."</P>
      <P>"Not safe! What do you mean?"</P>
      <P>"Ah, that's what I mustn't say. But do take my advice and move your 
      rooms. We had a grand row to-day. You must have heard us, for you came 
      down the stairs."</P>
      <P>"I saw that you had fallen out."</P>
      <P>"He's a horrible chap, Smith. That is the only word for him. I have had 
      doubts about him ever since that night when he fainted—you remember, when 
      you came down. I taxed him to-day, and he told me things that made my hair 
      rise, and wanted me to stand in with him. I'm not straight-laced, but I am 
      a clergyman's son, you know, and I think there are some things which are 
      quite beyond the pale. I only thank God that I found him out before it was 
      too late, for he was to have married into my family."</P>
      <P>"This is all very fine, Lee," said Abercrombie Smith curtly. "But 
      either you are saying a great deal too much or a deal too little."</P>
      <P>"I give you a warning."</P>
      <P>"If there is real reason for warning, no promise can bind you. If I see 
      a rascal about to blow a place up with dynamite no pledge will stand in my 
      way of preventing him."</P>
      <P>"Ah, but I cannot prevent him, and I can do nothing but warn you."</P>
      <P>"Without saying what you warn me against."</P>
      <P>"Against Bellingham."</P>
      <P>"But that is childish. Why should I fear him, or any man?"</P>
      <P>"I can't tell you. I can only entreat you to change your rooms. You are 
      in danger where you are. I don't even say that Bellingham would wish to 
      injure you. But it might happen, for he is a dangerous neighbour just 
      now."</P>
      <P>"Perhaps I know more than you think," said Smith, looking keenly at the 
      young man's boyish, earnest face. "Suppose I tell you that someone else 
      shares Bellingham's rooms."</P>
      <P>Monkhouse Lee sprang from his chair in uncontrollable excitement.</P>
      <P>"You know, then?" he gasped.</P>
      <P>"A woman."</P>
      <P>Lee dropped back again with a groan.</P>
      <P>"My lips are sealed," he said. "I must not speak."</P>
      <P>"Well, anyhow," said Smith, rising, "it is not likely that I should 
      allow myself to be frightened out of rooms which suit me very nicely. It 
      would be a little too feeble for me to move out all my goods and chattels 
      because you say that Bellingham might in some unexplained way do me an 
      injury. I think that I'll just take my chance, and stay where I am, and as 
      I see that it's nearly five o'clock, I must ask you to excuse me."</P>
      <P>He bade the young student adieu in a few curt words, and made his way 
      homeward through the sweet spring evening feeling half-ruffled, 
      half-amused, as any other strong, unimaginative man might who has been 
      menaced by a vague and shadowy danger.</P>
      <P>There was one little indulgence which Abercrombie Smith always allowed 
      himself, however closely his work might press upon him. Twice a week, on 
      the Tuesday and the Friday, it was his invariable custom to walk over to 
      Farlingford, the residence of Doctor Plumptree Peterson, situated about a 
      mile and a half out of Oxford. Peterson had been a close friend of Smith's 
      elder brother, Francis, and as he was a bachelor, fairly well-to-do, with 
      a good cellar and a better library, his house was a pleasant goal for a 
      man who was in need of a brisk walk. Twice a week, then, the medical 
      student would swing out there along the dark country roads and spend a 
      pleasant hour in Peterson's comfortable study, discussing, over a glass of 
      old port, the gossip of the 'varsity or the latest developments of 
      medicine or of surgery.</P>
      <P>On the day which followed his interview with Monkhouse Lee, Smith shut 
      up his books at a quarter past eight, the hour when he usually started for 
      his friend's house. As he was leaving his room, however, his eyes chanced 
      to fall upon one of the books which Bellingham had lent him, and his 
      conscience pricked him for not having returned it. However repellent the 
      man might be, he should not be treated with discourtesy. Taking the book, 
      he walked downstairs and knocked at his neighbour's door. There was no 
      answer; but on turning the handle he found that it was unlocked. Pleased 
      at the thought of avoiding an interview, he stepped inside, and placed the 
      book with his card upon the table.</P>
      <P>The lamp was turned half down, but Smith could see the details of the 
      room plainly enough. It was all much as he had seen it before—the frieze, 
      the animal-headed gods, the hanging crocodile, and the table littered over 
      with papers and dried leaves. The mummy case stood upright against the 
      wall, but the mummy itself was missing. There was no sign of any second 
      occupant of the room, and he felt as he withdrew that he had probably done 
      Bellingham an injustice. Had he a guilty secret to preserve, he would 
      hardly leave his door open so that all the world might enter.</P>
      <P>The spiral stair was as black as pitch, and Smith was slowly making his 
      way down its irregular steps, when he was suddenly conscious that 
      something had passed him in the darkness. There was a faint sound, a whiff 
      of air, a light brushing past his elbow, but so slight that he could 
      scarcely be certain of it. He stopped and listened, but the wind was 
      rustling among the ivy outside, and he could hear nothing else.</P>
      <P>"Is that you, Styles?" he shouted.</P>
      <P>There was no answer, and all was still behind him. It must have been a 
      sudden gust of air, for there were crannies and cracks in the old turret. 
      And yet he could almost have sworn that he heard a footfall by his very 
      side. He had emerged into the quadrangle, still turning the matter over in 
      his head, when a man came running swiftly across the smooth-cropped 
      lawn.</P>
      <P>"Is that you, Smith?"</P>
      <P>"Hullo, Hastie!"</P>
      <P>"For God's sake come at once! Young Lee is drowned! Here's Harrington 
      of King's with the news. The doctor is out. You'll do, but come along at 
      once. There may be life in him."</P>
      <P>"Have you brandy?"</P>
      <P>"No."</P>
      <P>I'll bring some. There's a flask on my table."</P>
      <P>Smith bounded up the stairs, taking three at a time, seized the flask, 
      and was rushing down with it, when, as he passed Bellingham's room, his 
      eyes fell upon something which left him gasping and staring upon the 
      landing. </P>
      <P>The door, which he had closed behind him, was now open, and right in 
      front of him, with the lamp-light shining upon it, was the mummy case. 
      Three minutes ago it had been empty. He could swear to that. Now it framed 
      the lank body of its horrible occupant, who stood, grim and stark, with 
      his black, shrivelled face towards the door. The form was lifeless and 
      inert, but it seemed to Smith as he gazed that there still lingered a 
      lurid spark of vitality, some faint sign of consciousness in the little 
      eyes which lurked in the depths of the hollow sockets. So astounded and 
      shaken was he that he had forgotten his errand, and was still staring at 
      the lean, sunken figure when the voice of his friend below recalled him to 
      himself.</P>
      <P>"Come on, Smith!" he shouted. "It's life and death, you know. Hurry up! 
      Now, then," he added, as the medical student reappeared, "let us do a 
      sprint. It is well under a mile, and we should do it in five minutes. A 
      human life is better worth running for than a pot."</P>
      <P>Neck and neck they dashed through the darkness, and did not pull up 
      until panting and spent, they had reached the little cottage by the river. 
      Young Lee, limp and dripping like a broken water-plant, was stretched upon 
      the sofa, the green scum of the river upon his black hair, and a fringe of 
      white foam upon his leaden-hued lips. Beside him knelt his fellow-student, 
      Harrington, endeavouring to chafe some warmth back into his rigid 
      limbs.</P>
      <P>"I think there's life in him," said Smith, with his hand to the lad's 
      side. "Put your watch glass to his lips. Yes, there's dimming on it. You 
      take one arm, Hastie. Now work it as I do, and we'll soon pull him 
      round."</P>
      <P>For ten minutes they worked in silence, inflating and depressing the 
      chest of the unconscious man. At the end of that time a shiver ran through 
      his body, his lips trembled, and he opened his eyes. The three students 
      burst out into an irrepressible cheer.</P>
      <P>"Wake up, old chap. You've frightened us quite enough."</P>
      <P>"Have some brandy. Take a sip from the flask."</P>
      <P>"He's all right now," said his companion Harrington. "Heavens, what a 
      fright I got! I was reading here, and he had gone out for a stroll as far 
      as the river when I heard a scream and a splash. Out I ran, and by the 
      time I could find him and fish him out, all life seemed to have gone. Then 
      Simpson couldn't get a doctor, for he has a game-leg, and I had to run, 
      and I don't know what I'd have done without you fellows. That's right, old 
      chap. Sit up.</P>
      <P>Monkhouse Lee had raised himself on his hands, and looked wildly about 
      him.</P>
      <P>"What's up?" he asked. "I've been in the water. Ah, yes; I 
      remember."</P>
      <P>A look of fear came into his eyes, and he sank his face into his 
      hands.</P>
      <P>"How did you fall in?"</P>
      <P>"I didn't fall in."</P>
      <P>"How then?"</P>
      <P>"I was thrown in. I was standing by the bank, and something from behind 
      picked me up like a feather and hurled me in. I heard nothing, and I saw 
      nothing. But I know what it was, for all that."</P>
      <P>"And so do I," whispered Smith.</P>
      <P>Lee looked up with a quick glance of surprise.</P>
      <P>"You've learned, then?" he said. "You remember the advice I gave 
      you?"</P>
      <P>"Yes, and I begin to think that I shall take it."</P>
      <P>"I don't know what the deuce you fellows are talking about," said 
      Hastie, "but I think, if I were you, Harrington, I should get Lee to bed 
      at once. It will be time enough to discuss the why and the wherefore when 
      he is a little stronger. I think, Smith, you and I can leave him alone 
      now. I am walking back to college; if you are coming in that direction, we 
      can have a chat."</P>
      <P>But it was little chat that they had upon their homeward path. Smith's 
      mind was too full of the incidents of the evening, the absence of the 
      mummy from his neighbour's rooms, the step that passed him on the stair, 
      the reappearance—the extraordinary, inexplicable reappearance of the 
      grisly thing—and then this attack upon Lee, corresponding so closely to 
      the previous outrage upon another man against whom Bellingham bore a 
      grudge. All this settled in his thoughts, together with the many little 
      incidents which had previously turned him against his neighbour, and the 
      singular circumstances under which he was first called in to him. What had 
      been a dim suspicion, a vague, fantastic conjecture, had suddenly taken 
      form, and stood out in his mind as a grim fact, a thing not to be denied. 
      And yet, how monstrous it was! how unheard of! how entirely beyond all 
      bounds of human experience. An impartial judge, or even the friend who 
      walked by his side, would simply tell him that his eyes had deceived him, 
      that the mummy had been there all the time, that young Lee had tumbled 
      into the river as any other man tumbles into a river, and the blue pill 
      was the best thing for a disordered liver. He felt that he would have said 
      as much if the positions had been reversed. And yet he could swear that 
      Bellingham was a murderer at heart, and that he wielded a weapon such as 
      no man had ever used in all the grim history of crime.</P>
      <P>Hastie had branched off to his rooms with a few crisp and emphatic 
      comments upon his friend's unsociability, and Abercrombie Smith crossed 
      the quadrangle to his corner turret with a strong feeling of repulsion for 
      his chambers and their associations. He would take Lee's advice, and move 
      his quarters as soon as possible, for how could a man study when his ear 
      was ever straining for every murmur or footstep in the room below? He 
      observed, as he crossed over the lawn, that the light was still shining in 
      Bellingham's window, and as he passed up the staircase the door opened, 
      and the man himself looked out at him. With his fat, evil face he was like 
      some bloated spider fresh from the weaving of his poisonous web.</P>
      <P>"Good evening," said he. "Won't you come in?"</P>
      <P>"No," cried Smith fiercely.</P>
      <P>"No? You are as busy as ever? I wanted to ask you about Lee. I was 
      sorry to hear that there was a rumour that something was amiss with 
      him."</P>
      <P>His features were grave, but there was the gleam of a hidden laugh in 
      his eyes as he spoke. Smith saw it, and he could have knocked him down for 
      it.</P>
      <P>"You'll be sorrier still to hear that Monkhouse Lee is doing very well, 
      and is out of all danger," he answered. "Your hellish tricks have not come 
      off this time. Oh, you needn't try to brazen it out. I know all about 
      it."</P>
      <P>Bellingham took a step back from the angry student, and half-closed the 
      door as if to protect himself.</P>
      <P>"You are mad," he said. "What do you mean? Do you assert that I had 
      anything to do with Lee's accident?"</P>
      <P>"Yes," thundered Smith. "You and that bag of bones behind you; you 
      worked it between you. I tell you what it is, Master B., they have given 
      up burning folk like you, but we still keep a hangman, and, by George! if 
      any man in this college meets his death while you are here, I'll have you 
      up, and if you don't swing for it, it won't be my fault. You'll find that 
      your filthy Egyptian tricks won't answer in England."</P>
      <P>"You're a raving lunatic," said Bellingham.</P>
      <P>"All right. You just remember what I say, for you'll find that I'll be 
      better than my word."</P>
      <P>The door slammed, and Smith went fuming up to his chamber, where he 
      locked the door upon the inside, and spent half the night in smoking his 
      old briar and brooding over the strange events of the evening.</P>
      <P>Next morning Abercrombie Smith heard nothing of his neighbour, but 
      Harrington called upon him in the afternoon to say that Lee was almost 
      himself again. All day Smith stuck fast to his work, but in the evening he 
      determined to pay the visit to his friend Doctor Peterson upon which he 
      had started the night before. A good walk and a friendly chat would be 
      welcome to his jangled nerves.</P>
      <P>Bellingham's door was shut as he passed, but glancing back when he was 
      some distance from the turret, he saw his neighbour's head at the window 
      outlined against the lamp-light, his face pressed apparently against the 
      glass as he gazed out into the darkness. It was a blessing to be away from 
      all contact with him, if but for a few hours, and Smith stepped out 
      briskly, and breathed the soft spring air into his lungs. The half-moon 
      lay in the west between two Gothic pinnacles, and threw upon the silvered 
      street a dark tracery from the stonework above. There was a brisk breeze, 
      and light, fleecy clouds drifted swiftly across the sky. Old's was on the 
      very border of the town, and in five minutes Smith found himself beyond 
      the houses and between the hedges of a May-scented, Oxfordshire lane.</P>
      <P>It was a lonely and little-frequented road which led to his friend's 
      house. Early as it was, Smith did not meet a single soul upon his way. He 
      walked briskly along until he came to the avenue gate, which opened into 
      the long, gravel drive leading up to Farlingford. In front of him he could 
      see the cosy, red light of the windows glimmering through the foliage. He 
      stood with his hand upon the iron latch of the swinging gate, and he 
      glanced back at the road along which he had come. Something was coming 
      swiftly down it.</P>
      <P>It moved in the shadow of the hedge, silently and furtively, a dark, 
      crouching figure, dimly visible against the black background. Even as he 
      gazed back at it, it had lessened its distance by twenty paces, and was 
      fast closing upon him. Out of the darkness he had a glimpse of a scraggy 
      neck, and of two eyes that will ever haunt him in his dreams. He turned, 
      and with a cry of terror he ran for his life up the avenue. There were the 
      red lights, the signals of safety, almost within a stone's-throw of him. 
      He was a famous runner, but never had he run as he ran that night.</P>
      <P>The heavy gate had swung into place behind him but he heard it dash 
      open again before his pursuer. As he rushed madly and wildly through the 
      night, he could hear a swift, dry patter behind him, and could see, as he 
      threw back a glance, that this horror was bounding like a tiger at his 
      heels, with blazing eyes and one stringy arm out-thrown. Thank God, the 
      door was ajar. He could see the thin bar of light which shot from the lamp 
      in the hall. Nearer yet sounded the clatter from behind. He heard a hoarse 
      gurgling at his very shoulder. With a shriek he flung himself against the 
      door, slammed and bolted it behind him, and half-fainting on to the hall 
      chair.</P>
      <P>"My goodness, Smith, what's the matter?" asked Peterson, appearing at 
      the door of his study.</P>
      <P>"Give me some brandy."</P>
      <P>Peterson disappeared, and came rushing out again with a glass and a 
      decanter.</P>
      <P>"You need it," he said, as his visitor drank off what he poured out for 
      him. "Why, man, you are as white as a cheese."</P>
      <P>Smith laid down his glass, rose up, and took a deep breath.</P>
      <P>"I am my own man again now," said he. "I was never so unmanned before. 
      But, with your leave, Peterson, I will sleep here to-night, for I don't 
      think I could face that road again except by daylight. It's weak, I know, 
      but I can't help it."</P>
      <P>Peterson looked at his visitor with a very questioning eye.</P>
      <P>"Of course you shall sleep here if you wish. I'll tell Mrs. Burney to 
      make up the spare bed. Where are you off to now?"</P>
      <P>"Come up with me to the window that overlooks the door. I want you to 
      see what I have seen."</P>
      <P>They went up to the window of the upper hall whence they could look 
      down upon the approach to the house. The drive and the fields on either 
      side lay quiet and still, bathed in the peaceful moonlight.</P>
      <P>"Well, really, Smith," remarked Peterson, "it is well that I know you 
      to be an abstemious man. What in the world can have frightened you?"</P>
      <P>"I'll tell you presently. But where can it have gone? Ah, now, look, 
      look! See the curve of the road just beyond your gate."</P>
      <P>"Yes, I see; you needn't pinch my arm off. I saw someone pass. I should 
      say a man, rather thin, apparently, and tall, very tall. But what of him? 
      And what of yourself? You are still shaking like an aspen leaf."</P>
      <P>"I have been within hand-grip of the devil, that's all. But come down 
      to your study, and I shall tell you the whole story."</P>
      <P>He did so. Under the cheery lamp-light with a glass of wine on the 
      table beside him, and the portly form and florid face of his friend in 
      front, he narrated, in their order, all the events, great and small, which 
      had formed so singular a chain, from the night on which he had found 
      Bellingham fainting in front of the mummy case until this horrid 
      experience of an hour ago.</P>
      <P>"There now," he said as he concluded, "that's the whole, black 
      business. It is monstrous and incredible, but it is true."</P>
      <P>Doctor Plumptree Peterson sat for some time in silence with a very 
      puzzled expression upon his face.</P>
      <P>"I never heard of such a thing in my life, never!" he said at last. 
      "You have told me the facts. Now tell me your inferences."</P>
      <P>"You can draw your own."</P>
      <P>"But I should like to hear yours. You have thought over the matter, and 
      I have not."</P>
      <P>"Well, it must be a little vague in detail, but the main points seem to 
      me to be clear enough. This fellow Bellingham, in his Eastern studies, has 
      got hold of some infernal secret by which a mummy—or possibly only this 
      particular mummy—can be temporarily brought to life. He was trying this 
      disgusting business on the night when he fainted. No doubt the sight of 
      the creature moving had shaken his nerve, even though he had expected it. 
      You remember that almost the first words he said were to call out upon 
      himself as a fool. Well, he got more hardened afterwards, and carried the 
      matter through without fainting. The vitality which he could put into it 
      was evidently only a passing thing, for I have seen it continually in its 
      case as dead as this table. He has some elaborate process, I fancy, by 
      which he brings the thing to pass. Having done it, he naturally bethought 
      him that he might use the creature as an agent. It has intelligence and it 
      has strength. For some purpose he took Lee into his confidence; but Lee, 
      like a decent Christian, would have nothing to do with such a business. 
      Then they had a row, and Lee vowed that he would tell his sister of 
      Bellingham's true character. Bellingham's game was to prevent him, and he 
      nearly managed it, by setting this creature of his on his track. He had 
      already tried its powers upon another man—Norton—towards whom he had a 
      grudge. It is the merest chance that he has not two murders upon his soul. 
      Then, when I taxed him with the matter, he had the strongest reasons for 
      wishing to get me out of the way before I could convey my knowledge to 
      anyone else. He got his chance when I went out, for he knew my habits and 
      where I was bound for. I have had a narrow shave, Peterson, and it is mere 
      luck you didn't find me on your doorstep in the morning. I'm not a nervous 
      man as a rule, and I never thought to have the fear of death put upon me 
      as it was to-night."</P>
      <P>"My dear boy, you take the matter too seriously," said his companion. 
      "Your nerves are out of order with your work, and you make too much of it. 
      How could such a thing as this stride about the streets of Oxford, even at 
      night, without being seen?"</P>
      <P>"It has been seen. There is quite a scare in the town about an escaped 
      ape, as they imagine the creature to be. It is the talk of the place."</P>
      <P>"Well, it's a striking chain of events. And yet, my dear fellow, you 
      must allow that each incident in itself is capable of a more natural 
      explanation."</P>
      <P>"What! even my adventure of to-night?"</P>
      <P>"Certainly. You come out with your nerves all unstrung, and your head 
      full of this theory of yours. Some gaunt, half-famished tramp steals after 
      you, and seeing you run, is emboldened to pursue you. Your fears and 
      imagination do the rest."</P>
      <P>"It won't do, Peterson; it won't do."</P>
      <P>"And again, in the instance of your finding the mummy case empty, and 
      then a few moments later with an occupant, you know that it was 
      lamp-light, that the lamp was half turned down, and that you had no 
      special reason to look hard at the case. It is quite possible that you may 
      have overlooked the creature in the first instance."</P>
      <P>"No, no; it is out of the question."</P>
      <P>"And then Lee may have fallen into the river, and Norton been 
      garrotted. It is certainly a formidable indictment that you have against 
      Bellingham; but if you were to place it before a police magistrate, he 
      would simply laugh in your face."</P>
      <P>"I know he would. That is why I mean to take the matter into my own 
      hands."</P>
      <P>"Eh?"</P>
      <P>"Yes; I feel that a public duty rests upon me, and, besides, I must do 
      it for my own safety, unless I choose to allow myself to be hunted by this 
      beast out of the college, and that would be a little too feeble. I have 
      quite made up my mind what I shall do. And first of all, may I use your 
      paper and pens for an hour?"</P>
      <P>"Most certainly. You will find all that you want upon that 
      side-table."</P>
      <P>Abercrombie Smith sat down before a sheet of foolscap, and for an hour, 
      and then for a second hour his pen travelled swiftly over it. Page after 
      page was finished and tossed aside while his friend leaned back in his 
      armchair, looking across at him with patient curiosity. At last, with an 
      exclamation of satisfaction, Smith sprang to his feet, gathered his papers 
      up into order, and laid the last one upon Peterson's desk.</P>
      <P>"Kindly sign this as a witness," he said.</P>
      <P>"A witness? Of what?"</P>
      <P>"Of my signature, and of the date. The date is the most important. Why, 
      Peterson, my life might hang upon it."</P>
      <P>"My dear Smith, you are talking wildly. Let me beg you to go to 
      bed."</P>
      <P>"On the contrary, I never spoke so deliberately in my life. And I will 
      promise to go to bed the moment you have signed it."</P>
      <P>"But what is it?"</P>
      <P>"It is a statement of all that I have been telling you to-night. I wish 
      you to witness it."</P>
      <P>"Certainly," said Peterson, signing his name under that of his 
      companion. "There you are! But what is the idea?"</P>
      <P>"You will kindly retain it, and produce it in case I am arrested."</P>
      <P>"Arrested? For what?"</P>
      <P>"For murder. It is quite on the cards. I wish to be ready for every 
      event. There is only one course open to me, and I am determined to take 
      it."</P>
      <P>"For Heaven's sake, don't do anything rash!"</P>
      <P>"Believe me, it would be far more rash to adopt any other course. I 
      hope that we won't need to bother you, but it will ease my mind to know 
      that you have this statement of my motives. And now I am ready to take 
      your advice and to go to roost, for I want to be at my best in the 
      morning."&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Abercrombie Smith was not an entirely pleasant man to have as an enemy. 
      Slow and easy-tempered, he was formidable when driven to action. He 
      brought to every purpose in life the same deliberate resoluteness which 
      had distinguished him as a scientific student. He had laid his studies 
      aside for a day, but he intended that the day should not be wasted. Not a 
      word did he say to his host as to his plans, but by nine o'clock he was 
      well on his way to Oxford.</P>
      <P>In the High Street he stopped at Clifford's, the gun-maker's, and 
      bought a heavy revolver, with a box of central-fire cartridges. Six of 
      them he slipped into the chambers, and half-cocking the weapon, placed it 
      in the pocket of his coat. He then made his way to Hastie's rooms, where 
      the big oarsman was lounging over his breakfast, with the <I>Sporting 
      Times</I> propped up against the coffee-pot.</P>
      <P>"Hullo! What's up?" he asked. "Have some coffee?"</P>
      <P>"No, thank you. I want you to come with me, Hastie, and do what I ask 
      you."</P>
      <P>"Certainly, my boy."</P>
      <P>"And bring a heavy stick with you."</P>
      <P>"Hullo!" Hastie stared. "Here's a hunting crop that would fell an 
      ox."</P>
      <P>"One other thing. You have a box of amputating knives. Give me the 
      longest of them."</P>
      <P>"There you are. You seem to be fairly on the war trail. Anything 
      else?"</P>
      <P>"No; that will do." Smith placed the knife inside his coat, and led the 
      way to the quadrangle. "We are neither of us chickens, Hastie," said he. 
      "I think I can do this job alone, but I take you as a precaution. I am 
      going to have a little talk with Bellingham. If I have only him to deal 
      with, I won't, of course, need you. If I shout, however, up you come, and 
      lam out with your whip as hard as you can lick. Do you understand?"</P>
      <P>"All right. I'll come if I hear you bellow."</P>
      <P>"Stay here, then. I may be a little time, but don't budge until I come 
      down."</P>
      <P>"I'm a fixture."</P>
      <P>Smith ascended the stairs, opened Bellingham's door and stepped in. 
      Bellingham was seated behind his table, writing. Beside him, among his 
      litter of strange possessions, towered the mummy case, with its sale 
      number 249 still stuck upon its front, and its hideous occupant stiff and 
      stark within it. Smith looked very deliberately round him, closed the 
      door, and then, stepping across to the fireplace, struck a match and set 
      the fire alight. Bellingham sat staring, with amazement and rage upon his 
      bloated face.</P>
      <P>"Well, really now, you make yourself at home," he gasped.</P>
      <P>Smith sat himself deliberately down, placing his watch upon the table, 
      drew out his pistol, cocked it, and laid it in his lap. Then he took the 
      long amputating knife from his bosom, and threw it down in front of 
      Bellingham.</P>
      <P>"Now, then," said he, "just get to work and cut up that mummy."</P>
      <P>"Oh, is that it?" said Bellingham with a sneer.</P>
      <P>"Yes, that is it. They tell me that the law can't touch you. But I have 
      a law that will set matters straight. If in five minutes you have not set 
      to work, I swear by the God who made me that I will put a bullet through 
      your brain!"</P>
      <P>"You would murder me?"</P>
      <P>Bellingham had half-risen, and his face was the colour of putty.</P>
      <P>"Yes."</P>
      <P>"And for what?"</P>
      <P>"To stop your mischief. One minute has gone."</P>
      <P>"But what have I done?"</P>
      <P>"I know and you know."</P>
      <P>"This is mere bullying."</P>
      <P>"Two minutes are gone."</P>
      <P>"But you must give reasons. You are a madman—a dangerous madman. Why 
      should I destroy my own property? It is a valuable mummy."</P>
      <P>"You must cut it up, and you must burn it."</P>
      <P>"I will do no such thing."</P>
      <P>"Four minutes are gone."</P>
      <P>Smith took up the pistol and he looked towards Bellingham with an 
      inexorable face. As the second-hand stole round, he raised his hand, and 
      the finger twitched upon the trigger.</P>
      <P>"There! there! I'll do it!" screamed Bellingham.</P>
      <P>In frantic haste he caught up the knife and hacked at the figure of the 
      mummy, ever glancing round to see the eye and the weapon of his terrible 
      visitor bent upon him. The creature crackled and snapped under every stab 
      of the keen blade. A thick, yellow dust rose up from it. Spices and dried 
      essences rained down upon the floor. Suddenly, with a rending crack, its 
      backbone snapped asunder, and it fell, a brown heap of sprawling limbs, 
      upon the floor.</P>
      <P>"Now into the fire!" said Smith.</P>
      <P>The flames leaped and roared as the dried and tinder-like debris was 
      piled upon it. The little room was like the stoke-hole of a steamer and 
      the sweat ran down the faces of the two men; but still the one stooped and 
      worked, while the other sat watching him with a set face. A thick, fat 
      smoke oozed out from the fire, and a heavy smell of burned resin and 
      singed hair filled the air. In a quarter of an hour a few charred and 
      brittle sticks were all that was left of Lot No. 249.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps that will satisfy you," snarled Bellingham, with hate and fear 
      in his little grey eyes as he glanced back at his tormentor.</P>
      <P>"No; I must make a clean sweep of all your materials. We must have no 
      more devil's tricks. In with all these leaves! They may have something to 
      do with it."</P>
      <P>"And what now?" asked Bellingham, when the leaves also had been added 
      to the blaze.</P>
      <P>"Now the roll of papyrus which you had on the table that night. It is 
      in that drawer, I think."</P>
      <P>"No, no," shouted Bellingham. "Don't burn that! Why, man, you don't 
      know what you do. It is unique; it contains wisdom which is nowhere else 
      to be found."</P>
      <P>"Out with it!"</P>
      <P>"But look here, Smith, you can't really mean it. I'll share the 
      knowledge with you. I'll teach you all that is in it. Or, stay, let me 
      only copy it before you burn it!"</P>
      <P>Smith stepped forward and turned the key in the drawer. Taking out the 
      yellow, curled roll of paper, he threw it into the fire, and pressed it 
      down with his heel. Bellingham screamed, and grabbed at it; but Smith 
      pushed him back and stood over it until it was reduced to a formless, grey 
      ash.</P>
      <P>"Now, Master B.," said he, "I think I have pretty well drawn your 
      teeth. You'll hear from me again, if you return to your old tricks. And 
      now good morning, for I must go back to my studies."</P>
      <P>And such is the narrative of Abercrombie Smith as to the singular 
      events which occurred in Old College, Oxford, in the spring of '84. As 
      Bellingham left the university immediately afterwards, and was last heard 
      of in the Soudan, there is no one who can contradict his statement. But 
      the wisdom of men is small, and the ways of Nature are strange, and who 
      shall put a bound to the dark things which may be found by those who seek 
      for them?</FONT><FONT face="Courier New" size=2></P>
