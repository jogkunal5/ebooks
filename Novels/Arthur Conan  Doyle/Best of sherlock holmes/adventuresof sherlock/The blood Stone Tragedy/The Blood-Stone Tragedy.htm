      <P align=justify>‘HUSH!’ said my fellow-traveller, holding up his hand 
      with a warning gesture, and glancing at his wife, who was snugly ensconced 
      amongst her rugs in the corner. ‘Hush!’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘My dear sir,’ I remonstrated, ‘my reference to Doctor 
      Price—’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Hush!’ interrupted my companion, in a more authoritative 
      voice. ‘Not a word!’</P>
      <P align=justify>Now, this was very mysterious conduct. The gentleman who 
      curtailed my remarks so brusquely had entered the carriage at Rugby with 
      his wife, and we had been whiling away an hour or so of our journey by 
      retailing our views upon current subjects to each other. Having chatted 
      over one topic or another, some unlucky impulse had led me to refer to Dr 
      Price and his recent attempt at the revival of Druidism by the cremation 
      of an infant. To my surprise my allusion had a marked effect upon my 
      companion, who became much agitated, and checked me in the decisive manner 
      which I have quoted.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Ah! it’s all right,’ he resumed, bending over and 
      looking down at his wife. ‘She is asleep. Come over here into the far 
      corner, so that she cannot hear us if she wakes.’</P>
      <P align=justify>I obeyed this mysterious injunction, with many surmises 
      in my mind as to the cause of so much precaution.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘It’s a painful subject to her,’ he said, nodding his 
      head in the direction of the sleeping woman. ‘I have known her have an 
      attack of acute mania on hearing an allusion made to it.’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Made to what?’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘To Druidism.’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘What an extraordinary thing!’ I ejaculated.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘I have been keeping the papers from her during the last 
      week,’ continued my acquaintance, ‘so that she should not hear of this 
      escapade of the doctor. I am convinced it would have a very bad effect 
      upon her mind.’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Indeed!’ I remarked, not without a growing conviction 
      that my companion was a little wrong in the upper storey.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Ah! of course, you don’t understand,’ he said, smiling 
      at my evident bewilderment. ‘The fact is, that just before our 
      marriage—some ten years ago—my wife had a very terrible experience in 
      connection with Druidism. It did not get into the papers at the time, but 
      there are a good many people alive who can testify to the facts. It 
      shattered her nervous system, and anything which recalls it knocks her 
      over very much.’</P>
      <P align=justify>With this short preface, my new friend, leaning well 
      forward and speaking in a low voice, with many precautionary glances at 
      his sleeping wife, told me the story of her extraordinary adventure. I 
      have endeavoured to set it down in his own words as far as I can, but I 
      cannot imitate the earnestness of his manner, nor the weird effect 
      produced by the flickering carriage-lamp, and the presence of the 
      unconscious heroine of this strange story.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘I don’t know whether you know Wales well,’ he began; 
      ‘but even if you do, it is not at all likely that you have ever journeyed 
      as far as Llanduran. It is an out-of-the-way little mountain village up in 
      the north, not far from the sea, a place which is hardly marked in the 
      maps, and where no tourist ever goes unless he stumbles upon it by 
      accident. This was our fate in the autumn of ’72, and we were so taken by 
      the pretty surroundings and the primitive peasantry, that we made it our 
      resting-place for some time. We were a fairly large party—my brother 
      Stephen and his wife, my present wife, with her two brothers, and three 
      friends of mine from London. Altogether we had a very jolly time of it, 
      and astonished the quiet-living Cymric population not a little, until our 
      holiday was brought to an abrupt and tragic termination.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘I must tell you that my wife—or Miss Madison, as she was 
      in those days—was of a most adventurous disposition. She appeared to be 
      absolutely insensible to fear. I was continually remonstrating with her as 
      to the risks which she ran, and her brothers did all they could to 
      restrain her, but without avail. The more we spoke, the more daring would 
      she become. We were compelled, at last, to leave her behind when we 
      intended to do any serious mountaineering, for fear she should meet with 
      some accident.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘One morning, when we came down to breakfast, we learned 
      to our surprise that Miss Madison had been seen to leave the inn alone at 
      early dawn, in her walking-dress, and to take the direction of the 
      mountains. Her intention, evidently, was to steal a march upon us by 
      visiting alone some of those places which we had gone to without her. We 
      were all rather alarmed by this escapade of the wild girl; but our alarm 
      deepened into positive terror when the whole day passed without our 
      hearing a word of her. The district was a notoriously dangerous one. The 
      mountains, without being remarkably high, were jagged and steep, and 
      intersected by numerous chasms. Several fatal accidents had occurred of 
      late in the vicinity. No wonder, then, that I felt a sinking at my heart 
      when I left the inn that night at the head of a party with torches in 
      search of the woman whom I had already begun to love.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘I will tell you the story now from her point of view, 
      and give you that facts which we heard afterwards from her own lips.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Leaving the inn, then, and laughing to herself at the 
      way in which she was giving us the slip, she made the best of her way into 
      the mountains. The morning was a beautiful one, and the crisp, bracing air 
      increased her natural activity and endurance, so that she had walked a 
      very long way before the thought of fatigue entered her mind. She had gone 
      on at random, following the little goat-paths from one rugged valley to 
      another, until she had lost sight of all the familiar landmarks, and found 
      herself in a desolate labyrinth, surrounded on every side by precipitous 
      crags, and without the smallest sign of human life. Many women would have 
      been terrified in her position, but, as I have said, she was 
      constitutionally brave; so finding it hopeless to retrace her steps, she 
      pushed on, in the hope of reaching some eminence from which she could 
      catch a glimpse of the outside world.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘As she advanced, the scenery became bleaker and more 
      dismal. The mountains in those regions are always desolate, being hardly 
      picturesque enough to attract tourists, and too barren to allow any one to 
      settle among them. She stumbled along among great boulders, and along the 
      bed of a dried-up stream, with lofty granite walls on each side of her 
      without break or opening. Following the track of the old torrent, she 
      traced it at last to a place where there had evidently been a cascade, as 
      the bed of the stream descended precipitously for thirty or forty feet. 
      Hoping by ascending to obtain some idea of her whereabouts, my wife 
      clambered up this steep incline, and succeeded with some difficulty in 
      reaching the top.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘The sight before her was an extraordinary one. The gap 
      through which the stream had forced its way was the only entrance to a 
      little ravine, surrounded on all sides by high, dark cliffs. This secluded 
      nook formed a <I>cul-de-sac</I> about two hundred yards long and fifty 
      broad, ringed in by fir trees, which sprouted from the base of the rocky 
      walls. In the centre of the clear space in the middle was a large flat 
      slab, round which were placed a number of stones, standing upon their 
      ends, and forming a double circle. This arrangement was evidently 
      artificial, and my wife looked round, in the hope of seeing some signs of 
      human life. To her great delight she perceived among the trees a rough 
      sort of hut, to which she hurried, with the intention of getting some 
      refreshment if possible, and then of inquiring her way homewards.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘The rude door of this wooden dwelling was ajar, and Miss 
      Madison, after knocking several times without receiving an answer, pushed 
      her way in.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘The room in which she found herself was a small one, and 
      furnished in the roughest manner possible. A heap of goat-skins in the 
      corner appeared to have been utilised as a bed, and a large block of wood 
      in the centre was evidently intended as a table, as the remains of a meal, 
      in the shape of a couple of bones, were lying upon it. What struck the 
      young lady most, however, in this extraordinary apartment were the walls, 
      which were thickly covered with curious inscriptions, painted on it in 
      dark letters. These were in some unknown language, which she conjectured 
      to be Welsh; but there were others, especially over the door and in the 
      centre of each wall, which were evidently designed as symbols or charms, 
      consisting of the same letter, repeated a number of times in different 
      shapes and forms.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘My wife was standing in the door-way, regarding all 
      these strange things with natural curiosity, when she became aware of a 
      shadow which intervened between her and the sun. Turning round, she saw 
      behind her the most extraordinary mortal that she had ever beheld. He was 
      an elderly man, with long, floating hair and a grizzled beard, which 
      descended over his breast. He could not have been less than six feet four 
      inches high, and the breadth of his shoulders and length of his arms 
      denoted extraordinary strength, while the great club upon which he leaned 
      might have served him either as a support or as a weapon. His dress was a 
      sort of ragged gown, which had been originally white, but was now 
      weather-stained and dirty. What struck my wife, however, more than either 
      his other features or his strange attire, were his eyes, which were of a 
      light, almost colourless blue, but which projected considerably, and 
      shifted from one object to another without remaining still for an 
      instant.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "Hail, lady!" he exclaimed, advancing towards Miss 
      Madison, and speaking in a well-modulated voice. "For five moons I have 
      waited for you. Why hast thou tarried so long?"</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Considerably astonished, but more amused than 
      frightened, the young lady took a step or two back from this strange 
      apparition, who walked slowly forwards, waving his hands rhythmically from 
      side to side.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "The blood-stone is dry!" he cried, "the blood-stone is 
      dry! Shall it be said that in the days of the fifteenth avatar there was 
      no man who would honour the old gods, and no woman who would dare lie down 
      upon the blood-stone? Britain’s noblest and fairest have stretched 
      themselves upon that cold couch. You are worthy of the honour, maiden. Thy 
      cheek is unblanched, and thy hand is steady. So should she be whom the 
      high gods select."</P>
      <P align=justify>‘My wife had begun by this time to realise that the man 
      in front of her was a maniac, though she had not yet fathomed the meaning 
      of his strange words. She endeavoured to conceal her fright as much as 
      possible, however, and to conciliate her fierce-looking companion.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "You must lead a lonely life, sir," she said. "Who are 
      you, and why do you dwell up here alone?"</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "Who am I?" he cried, tossing his long, thin arms in 
      the air. "I am Ap-Griffiths, of the pure blood of Arisdenna, seventieth in 
      descent from the high priest Morla, who was second brother to the great 
      Queen Boadicea. Woman, I am the last of the Druids. All round," he 
      continued, mournfully, "men have left the old creed. None bow to the high 
      gods now. Only we are staunch and true, maiden; you and I—the slayer and 
      the slain."</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Thoroughly alarmed by this time, my wife endeavoured to 
      edge away to the mouth of the little glen, but the maniac, who was wildly 
      excited, caught her by the wrist and dragged her over to the spot where 
      the stones were.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "Have I not done it well!" he cried. "There have been 
      many larger, but none more complete. What is there wanting? Here is the 
      blood-stone," pointing to the flat slab in the centre; "it has been dry 
      for many years, but when you lie on it, maiden, with the flames roaring 
      around you, and when your life-blood hisses upon the hot stone, then the 
      gods will know that there are believers yet. Nay, do not shudder and 
      shrink. Your vile body may be charred and tortured, but your spirit will 
      soar above the stars, ever exulting in a happiness which no words can 
      depict. Mark my stones. Thirty-four without, and twenty-three within, 
      according to the direction of the learned and holy Morla. I have a trench, 
      too, around the blood-stone, and my instrument is as it should be." Here 
      he drew a long, keen knife from his bosom. "All has been ready for months, 
      save only the victim, and now the great gods have sent me that also."</P>
      <P align=justify>‘My wife was, as I have already told you, a woman of 
      great courage and resource. It was evident to her in a moment that to 
      attempt to escape was impossible, in the presence of so agile and powerful 
      an adversary. Her only hope of safety lay in humouring and outwitting him. 
      She turned towards him, therefore, and assumed as much calmness as she 
      could, while she asked the terrible question— </P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "When am I to be sacrificed?"</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "At the middle hour of the night," said the maniac, 
      with decision.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘She felt instinctively that it was useless to plead her 
      sex, her age, or her helplessness to this sanguinary fanatic. The sun was 
      already low down on the horizon, and there would be only a few hours to 
      pass before she should find herself stretched upon the fatal blood-stone. 
      Her last chance lay in the use she might make of that short period.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "I am ignorant," she said, "of many of the things of 
      which you speak. I have much to learn before I can die."</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "You are right, maiden," he said; "there is much which 
      none can teach in these latter days save those who still have the priestly 
      blood in their veins. Come with me into my dwelling, and I will discourse 
      with you concerning many things, that when thy soul is loosened from its 
      bonds it may know whither it speedeth."</P>
      <P align=justify>‘With these words the Druid, as I will call him, led Miss 
      Madison into the hut, and commanded her to be seated on a rough wooden 
      bench which stood opposite the door. He himself lay down upon a couple of 
      goat-skins at her feet, and began to talk to her with great volubility and 
      earnestness. Much of his conversation was unintelligible to her, and 
      occasionally he would break into rude doggerel verses, but she could 
      understand enough to gather that he was laying down the precepts of the 
      old British faith. Poor girl! her mind was too full of horror to allow her 
      to pay much attention to his disquisition. Certain death seemed to stare 
      her in the face—and death in its most horrible form. Look which way she 
      would, there seemed to be no possibility of escape. Through the half-open 
      door she could see that the night was drawing in. The Druid observed it 
      too, for, suddenly ceasing his harangue, he sprang to his feet, and seized 
      a great chopper which leaned against the wall.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "I must leave you for a time, maiden," he said. "There 
      is much to be done before the darkness comes. The wood is to be cut for 
      the funeral pyre, for I swear to you that none who ever lay upon that hard 
      bridal couch shall have had a more seemly ending than thine shall be."</P>
      <P align=justify>‘With these words he hurried out of the hut, and Miss 
      Madison could tell by the crashing sound that he was cutting among the fir 
      trees which surrounded the valley.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘For a moment a ray of hope came into her mind. Might she 
      not slip past him while he was engaged in his work, and gain the mouth of 
      the ravine without his detecting her? She rose with the determination to 
      risk everything upon the chance, when, to her unutterable horror, she 
      found that the cunning miscreant had, in some unaccountable way, managed 
      to slip the noose of a rope round her ankles while he lay at her feet, and 
      that she was firmly pinioned to the bench. It was only then that the 
      relentless cruelty and unbending resolution of the monster who had 
      captured her came fully home to her. She screamed piteously for aid, 
      though she knew that her cries were as useless as her struggles would be. 
      She was entirely at the mercy of the maniac.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘He came back upon hearing her cries, and stood in the 
      door-way, looking down at her with a look of melancholy upon his face. It 
      was so dark now that it was difficult for her to distinguish his 
      features.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "Lady," he said, "this is not what I had hoped. How 
      shall thy courage bear thee up at the supreme moment if thou shrinkest 
      now? You have been honoured above all women by the selection of the gods. 
      Canst thou not prove thyself worthy of the choice? Learn, too, that thy 
      cries are of no avail, for there is no human ear for many a mile. Thou art 
      not the only one on whom death will come to-night. When the red light of 
      thy pyre tinges the crags of Conmorris, and thy holocaust is completed, 
      then Ap-Griffiths, the last of the priestly line, shall pass away with his 
      mission gloriously fulfilled. My life, as well as yours, maiden, 
      terminates at the coming of the fifteenth avatar, which my knowledge 
      teaches me will be at the twelfth hour of this night."</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Driven to desperation, my poor wife prayed and begged 
      for mercy from the madman, using every possible entreaty and expostulation 
      to prevent him from carrying out his murderous design. Her prayers, 
      however, had the exactly opposite effect, for, flying into a paroxysm of 
      rage, the Druid sprang upon her, forcing her down on the bench, to which 
      she was already pinioned.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘ "Wicked and ungrateful woman!" he roared, winding a 
      cord round her body, and securing her more firmly than before, "would you 
      persuade the only faithful one to turn false? Not a word more, or I must 
      silence your tongue. You have already committed a grievous sin."</P>
      <P align=justify>‘With these words, he seized his chopper once more, and 
      went back to his work, cutting great faggots, and piling them around the 
      fatal blood-stone.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Gradually the darkness of night settled down upon the 
      little valley. The poor girl—stretched, more dead than alive, upon the 
      rough bench—could distinguish the gaunt outlines of the madman as he 
      wielded his chopper with demoniacal fury. Then the sound ceased, and she 
      lost sight of him in the gloom. When the moon came out, however, she 
      perceived him once more, kneeling among the perpendicular stones. He was 
      bowing his head, waving his arms, and giving other symptoms of being 
      engaged in religious devotion. Then he stood up, and burst into a rude, 
      wild chant, which reverberated through the little ravine, and was echoed 
      back from the rocky walls.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘During this time, the very possibility of escape had 
      ceased to occur to Miss Madison. Suddenly, however, her senses, strained 
      to an unnatural tension, detected a sound in the distance. She listened 
      once more in a quiver of excitement, and again it seemed to her that the 
      breeze bore a faint note to her ear, not unlike the sound of a horn. Could 
      it be that her friends had hit upon the right track? She lay perfectly 
      still, able to hear the beatings of her own heart. For five minutes all 
      was silence, save the monotonous chant of the maniac. Then again the same 
      long wail struck upon her ear, apparently rather louder and more near than 
      before. The Druid seemed to hear it, too, for he ceased his incantation, 
      and paced uneasily backwards and forwards.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘By her calculation it could not be more than eleven 
      o’clock. She had, therefore, an hour before her if the maniac adhered to 
      his former plan. The suspense was agonising. She lay, with her eyes shut, 
      counting the seconds, and waiting for a repetition of the sound; but all 
      was as silent as the grave.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Minute passed after minute. Half the hour was gone 
      without any sign of her rescuers. Another quarter passed, and the madman 
      began to take a last look at the pyre, and to make his final preparations. 
      Then he struck a light, and ignited the base of the mound of sticks. The 
      dry, resinous pine-wood crackled and spluttered, while long tongues of 
      flame licked round the borders of the fatal blood-stone. He approached the 
      door of the hut. "The time has come, maiden!" he said.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘It must have been a weird sight—the column of fire 
      shooting up into the air, throwing fantastic shadows among the gaunt fir 
      trees and the Druidical stones,—within the circle of light the white-clad 
      maniac, and in front of him the shrinking girl! He was in the very act of 
      undoing the cords which bound her, when, from the mouth of the glen came a 
      loud peal from a horn, and a chorus of human voices, all shouting 
      together. The light of the fire had attracted the rescue party.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘The Druid started like a hunted beast. "Too late!" he 
      roared; "too late! Thy doom is sealed! Thou must die!" He caught up the 
      bench and the prostrate woman, and, running with incredible speed, he laid 
      her beside the roaring flames, while he drew his long knife from his 
      bosom. My poor wife’s last recollection is of the fierce face looking down 
      at her, the savage, colourless eyes, and the uplifted knife.</FONT><FONT

      <P align=justify>‘When she came to herself, friendly faces were around 
      her. Her head was pillowed upon my breast, and the first word that passed 
      her dear lips was my name. The Druid was lying on his back, some little 
      way off, with his head cut open. I shall never get such a stick again as 
      the old friend which I broke that night over his crazy skull. It was touch 
      and go, though, for if I had got up one moment later, the fellow’s knife 
      would have been in Mary’s heart.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘We got her down to the inn at Llanduran, but she 
      developed brain fever next day, and for weeks her life was despaired of. 
      Such an impression has the adventure made upon her that the least incident 
      which may recall it has a very bad effect upon her. That is why I have 
      concealed the episode of Dr Price from her knowledge.’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘And the Druid?’ I asked.</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Oh, he turned out to be a very well-known man of science 
      and archaeologist. He had been erratic in his conduct, and was therefore 
      confined in the Merthyr Lunatic Asylum, but he escaped some six months 
      before, and all clue to his whereabouts was lost. He must have spent the 
      whole time in this nook among the mountains, practising his pagan rites, 
      and living on the goats and anything he could pick up.’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘What became of him, then?’</P>
      <P align=justify>‘Oh, that is about the queerest thing in the whole queer 
      story. Whether the crack with my stick depressed some bump, or how it 
      acted, I don’t know; but the fact remains that when he had recovered his 
      senses he was as sane as you and I, and has, as far as I know, remained so 
      ever since. They kept him in the asylum for some time for fear of a 
      relapse, but they let him out eventually. Hush! she’s waking up. Yes, they 
      will have a lively time at the beginning of the next session, to all 
      appearance. Don’t you think so, my dear?’</FONT> <!--mstheme--></FONT><!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
