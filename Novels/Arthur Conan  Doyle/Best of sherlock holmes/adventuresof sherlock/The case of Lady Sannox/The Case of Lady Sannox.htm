      <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
      <P align=justify>The relations between Douglas Stone and the notorious 
      Lady Sannox were very well known both among the fashionable circles of 
      which she was a brilliant member, and the scientific bodies which numbered 
      him among their most illustrious <I>confrères</I>. There was naturally, 
      therefore, a very widespread interest when it was announced one morning 
      that the lady had absolutely and for ever taken the veil, and that the 
      world would see her no more. When, at the very tail of this rumour, there 
      came the assurance that the celebrated operating surgeon, the man of steel 
      nerves, had been found in the morning by his valet, seated on one side of 
      his bed, smiling pleasantly upon the universe, with both legs jammed into 
      one side of his breeches and his great brain about as valuable as a cap 
      full of porridge, the matter was strong enough to give quite a little 
      thrill of interest to folk who had never hoped that their jaded nerves 
      were capable of such a sensation.</P>
      <P align=justify>Douglas Stone in his prime was one of the most remarkable 
      men in England. Indeed, he could hardly be said to have ever reached his 
      prime, for he was but nine-and-thirty at the time of this little incident. 
      Those who knew him best were aware that famous as he was as a surgeon, he 
      might have succeeded with even greater rapidity in any of a dozen lines of 
      life. He could have cut his way to fame as a soldier, struggled to it as 
      an explorer, bullied for it in the courts, or built it out of stone and 
      iron as an engineer. He was born to be great, for he could plan what 
      another man dare not do, and he could do what another man dare not plan. 
      In surgery none could follow him. His nerve, his judgment, his intuition, 
      were things apart. Again and again his knife cut away death, but grazed 
      the very springs of life in doing it, until his assistants were as white 
      as the patient. His energy, his audacity, his full-blooded 
      self-confidence—does not the memory of them still linger to the south of 
      Marylebone Road and the north of Oxford Street?</P>
      <P align=justify>His vices were as magnificent as his virtues, and 
      infinitely more picturesque. Large as was his income, and it was the third 
      largest of all professional men in London, it was far beneath the luxury 
      of his living. Deep in his complex nature lay a rich vein of sensualism, 
      at the sport of which he placed all the prizes of his life. The eye, the 
      ear, the touch, the palate, all were his masters. The bouquet of old 
      vintages, the scent of rare exotics, the curves and tints of the daintiest 
      potteries of Europe, it was to these that the quick-running stream of gold 
      was transformed. And then there came his sudden mad passion for Lady 
      Sannox, when a single interview with two challenging glances and a 
      whispered word set him ablaze. She was the loveliest woman in London and 
      the only one to him. He was one of the handsomest men in London, but not 
      the only one to her. She had a liking for new experiences, and was 
      gracious to most men who wooed her. It may have been cause or it may have 
      been effect that Lord Sannox looked fifty, though he was but 
      six-and-thirty.</P>
      <P align=justify>He was a quiet, silent, neutral-tinted man, this lord, 
      with thin lips and heavy eyelids, much given to gardening and full of 
      home-like habits. He had at one time been fond of acting, had even rented 
      a theatre in London, and on its boards had first seen Miss Marion Dawson, 
      to whom he had offered his hand, his title, and the third of a county. 
      Since his marriage this early hobby had become distasteful to him. Even in 
      private theatricals it was no longer possible to persuade him to exercise 
      the talent which he had often shown that he possessed. He was happier with 
      a spud and a watering-can among his orchids and chrysanthemums.</P>
      <P align=justify>It was quite an interesting problem whether he was 
      absolutely devoid of sense, or miserably wanting in spirit. Did he know 
      his lady's ways and condone them, or was he a mere blind, doting fool? It 
      was a point to be discussed over the teacups in snug little drawing-rooms, 
      or with the aid of a cigar in the bow windows of clubs. Bitter and plain 
      were the comments among men upon his conduct. There was but one who had a 
      good word to say for him, and he was the most silent member in the 
      smoking-room. He had seen him break in a horse at the University, and it 
      seemed to have left an impression upon his mind.</P>
      <P align=justify>But when Douglas Stone became the favourite all doubts as 
      to Lord Sannox's knowledge or ignorance were set for ever at rest. There 
      was no subterfuge about Stone. In his high-handed, impetuous fashion, he 
      set all caution and discretion at defiance. The scandal became notorious. 
      A learned body intimated that his name had been struck from the list of 
      its vice-presidents. Two friends implored him to consider his professional 
      credit. He cursed them all three, and spent forty guineas on a bangle to 
      take with him to the lady. He was at her house every evening, and she 
      drove in his carriage in the afternoons. There was not an attempt on 
      either side to conceal their relations; but there came at last a little 
      incident to interrupt them.</P>
      <P align=justify>It was a dismal winter's night, very cold and gusty, with 
      the wind whooping in the chimneys and blustering against the window-panes. 
      A thin spatter of rain tinkled on the glass with each fresh sough of the 
      gale, drowning for the instant the dull gurgle and drip from the eaves. 
      Douglas Stone had finished his dinner, and sat by his fire in the study, a 
      glass of rich port upon the malachite table at his elbow. As he raised it 
      to his lips, he held it up against the lamplight, and watched with the eye 
      of a connoisseur the tiny scales of beeswing which floated in its rich 
      ruby depths. The fire, as it spurted up, threw fitful lights upon his 
      bold, clear-cut face with its widely-opened grey eyes, its thick and yet 
      firm lips, and the deep, square jaw, which had something Roman in its 
      strength and its animalism. He smiled from time to time as he nestled back 
      in his luxurious chair. Indeed, he had a right to feel well pleased, for, 
      against the advice of six colleagues, he had performed an operation that 
      day of which only two cases were on record, and the result had been 
      brilliant beyond all expectation. No other man in London would have had 
      the daring to plan, or the skill to execute, such a heroic measure.</P>
      <P align=justify>But he had promised Lady Sannox to see her that evening 
      and it was already half-past eight. His hand was outstretched to the bell 
      to order the carriage when he heard the dull thud of the knocker. An 
      instant later there was the shuffling of feet in the hall, and the sharp 
      closing of a door.</P>
      <P align=justify>"A patient to see you, sir, in the consulting room," said 
      the butler.</P>
      <P align=justify>"About himself?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"No, sir; I think he wants you to go out."</P>
      <P align=justify>"It is too late," cried Douglas Stone peevishly. "I won't 
      go."</P>
      <P align=justify>"This is his card, sir."</P>
      <P align=justify>The butler presented it upon the gold salver which had 
      been given to his master by the wife of a Prime Minister.</P>
      <P align=justify>" ‘Hamil Ali, Smyrna.’ Hum! The fellow is a Turk, I 
      suppose."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Yes, sir. He seems as if he came from abroad, sir. And 
      he's in a terrible way."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Tut, tut! I have an engagement. I must go somewhere 
      else. But I'll see him. Show him in here, Pim."</P>
      <P align=justify>A few moments later the butler swung open the door and 
      ushered in a small and decrepit man, who walked with a bent back and with 
      the forward push of the face and blink of the eyes which goes with extreme 
      short sight. His face was swarthy, and his hair and beard of the deepest 
      black. In one hand he held a turban of white muslin striped with red, in 
      the other a small chamois leather bag.</P>
      <P align=justify>"Good evening," said Douglas Stone, when the butler had 
      closed the door. "You speak English, I presume?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"Yes, sir. I am from Asia Minor, but I speak English when 
      I speak slow."</P>
      <P align=justify>"You wanted me to go out, I understand?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"Yes, sir. I wanted very much that you should see my 
      wife."</P>
      <P align=justify>"I could come in the morning, but I have an engagement 
      which prevents me from seeing your wife tonight."</P>
      <P align=justify>The Turk's answer was a singular one. He pulled the 
      string which closed the mouth of the chamois leather bag, and poured a 
      flood of gold on to the table.</P>
      <P align=justify>"There are one hundred pounds there," said he, and I 
      promise you that it will not take you an hour. I have a cab ready at the 
      door."</P>
      <P align=justify>Douglas Stone glanced at his watch. An hour would not 
      make it too late to visit Lady Sannox. He had been there later. And the 
      fee was an extraordinarily high one. He had been pressed by his creditors 
      lately, and he could not afford to let such a chance pass. He would 
go.</P>
      <P align=justify>"What is the case?" he asked.</P>
      <P align=justify>"Oh, it is so sad a one! So sad a one! You have not, 
      perhaps, heard of the daggers of the Almohades?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"Never."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Ah, they are Eastern daggers of a great age and of a 
      singular shape, with the hilt like what you call a stirrup. I am a 
      curiosity dealer, you understand, and that is why I have come to England 
      from Smyrna, but next week I go back once more. Many things I brought with 
      me, and I have a few things left, but among them, to my sorrow, is one of 
      these daggers."</P>
      <P align=justify>"You will remember that I have an appointment, sir," said 
      the surgeon, with some irritation: "pray confine yourself to the necessary 
      details."</P>
      <P align=justify>"You will see that it is necessary. To-day my wife fell 
      down in a faint in the room in which I keep my wares, and she cut her 
      lower lip upon this cursed dagger of Almohades."</P>
      <P align=justify>"I see," said Douglas Stone, rising. "And you wish me to 
      dress the wound?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"No, no, it is worse than that."</P>
      <P align=justify>"What then?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"These daggers are poisoned."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Poisoned!"</P>
      <P align=justify>"Yes, and there is no man, East or West, who can tell now 
      what is the poison or what the cure. But all that is known I know, for my 
      father was in this trade before me, and we have had much to do with these 
      poisoned weapons."</P>
      <P align=justify>"What are the symptoms?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"Deep sleep, and death in thirty-hours."</P>
      <P align=justify>"And you say there is no cure. Why then should you pay me 
      this considerable fee?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"No drug can cure, but the knife may."</P>
      <P align=justify>"And how?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"The poison is slow of absorption. It remains for hours 
      in the wound."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Washing, then, might cleanse it?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"No more than in a snake bite. It is too subtle and too 
      deadly."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Excision of the wound, then?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"That is it. If it be on the finger, take the finger off. 
      So said my father always. But think of where this wound is, and that it is 
      my wife. It is dreadful!" But familiarity with such grim matters may take 
      the finer edge from a man's sympathy. To Douglas Stone this was already an 
      interesting case, and he brushed aside as irrelevant the feeble objections 
      of the husband. "It appears to be that or nothing," said he brusquely. "It 
      is better to lose a lip than a life."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Ah, yes, I know that you are right. Well, well, it is 
      kismet, and it must be faced. I have the cab, and you will come with me 
      and do this thing." Douglas Stone took his case of bistouries from a 
      drawer, and placed it with a roll of bandage and a compress of lint in his 
      pocket. He must waste no more time if he were to see Lady Sannox.</P>
      <P align=justify>"I am ready," said he, pulling on his overcoat. "Will you 
      take a glass of wine before you go out into this cold air?"</P>
      <P align=justify>His visitor shrank away, with a protesting hand 
      upraised.</P>
      <P align=justify>"You forget that I am a Mussulman, and a true follower of 
      the Prophet," said he. "But tell me what is the bottle of green glass 
      which you have placed in your pocket?" "It is chloroform."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Ah, that also is forbidden to us. It is a spirit, and we 
      make no use of such things."</P>
      <P align=justify>"What! You would allow your wife to go through an 
      operation without an anaesthetic?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"Ah! she will feel nothing, poor soul. The deep sleep has 
      already come on, which is the first working of the poison. And then I have 
      given her of our Smyrna opium. Come, sir, for already an hour has passed." 
      As they stepped out into the darkness, a sheet of rain was driven in upon 
      their faces, and the hall lamp, which dangled from the arm of a marble 
      Caryatid, went out with a fluff. Pim, the butler, pushed the heavy door 
      to, straining hard with his shoulder against the wind, while the two men 
      groped their way towards the yellow glare which showed where the cab was 
      waiting. An instant later they were rattling upon their journey. "Is it 
      far?" asked Douglas Stone. Oh, no. We have a very little quiet place off 
      the Euston Road."</P>
      <P align=justify>The surgeon pressed the spring of his repeater and 
      listened to the little tings which told him the hour. It was a quarter 
      past nine. He calculated the distances, and the short time which it would 
      take him to perform so trivial an operation. He ought to reach Lady Sannox 
      by ten o'clock. Through the fogged windows he saw the blurred gas lamps 
      dancing past, with occasionally the broader glare of a shop front. The 
      rain was pelting and rattling upon the leathern top of the carriage, and 
      the wheels swashed as they rolled through puddle and mud. Opposite to him 
      the white headgear of his companion gleamedfaintly through the obscurity. 
      The surgeon felt in his pockets and arranged his needles, his ligatures 
      and his safety-pins, that no time might be wasted when they arrived. He 
      chafed with impatience and drummed his foot upon the floor. But the cab 
      slowed down at last and pulled up. In an instant Douglas Stone was out, 
      and the Smyrna merchant's toe was at his very heel. "You can wait," said 
      he to the driver. It was a mean-looking house in a narrow and sordid 
      street. The surgeon, who knew his London well, cast a swift glance into 
      the shadows, but there was nothing distinctive—no shop, no movement, 
      nothing but a double line of dull, flat-faced houses, a double stretch of 
      wet flagstones which gleamed in the lamplight, and a double rush of water 
      in the gutters which swirled and gurgled towards the sewer gratings. The 
      door which faced them was blotched and discoloured, and a faint light in 
      the fan pane above it served to show the dust and the grime which covered 
      it. Above, in one of the bedroom windows, there was a dull yellow glimmer. 
      The merchant knocked loudly, and, as he turned his dark face towards the 
      light, Douglas Stone could see that it was contracted with anxiety. A bolt 
      was drawn, and an elderly woman with a taper stood in the doorway, 
      shielding the thin flame with her gnarled hand. "Is all well?" gasped the 
      merchant. "She is as you left her, sir."</P>
      <P align=justify>"She has not spoken?"</P>
      <P align=justify>"No, she is in a deep sleep."</P>
      <P align=justify>The merchant closed the door, and Douglas Stone walked 
      down the narrow passage, glancing about him in some surprise as he did so. 
      There was no oil-cloth, no mat, no hat-rack. Deep grey dust and heavy 
      festoons of cobwebs met his eyes everywhere. Following the old woman up 
      the winding stair, his firm footfall echoed harshly through the silent 
      house. There was no carpet. The bedroom was on the second landing. Douglas 
      Stone followed the old nurse into it, with the merchant at his heels. 
      Here, at least, there was furniture and to spare. The floor was littered 
      and the corners piled with Turkish cabinets, inlaid tables, coats of chain 
      mail, strange pipes, and grotesque weapons. A single small lamp stood upon 
      a bracket on the wall. Douglas Stone took it down, and picking his way 
      among the lumber, walked over to a couch in the corner, on which lay a 
      woman dressed in the Turkish fashion, with yashmak and veil. The lower 
      part of the face was exposed, and the surgeon saw a jagged cut which 
      zigzagged along the border of the under lip. "You will forgive the 
      yashmak," said the Turk. "You know our views about woman in the East."</P>
      <P align=justify>But the surgeon was not thinking about the yashmak. This 
      was no longer a woman to him. It was a case. He stooped and examined the 
      wound carefully. "There are no signs of irritation," said he. "We might 
      delay the operation until local symptoms develop."</P>
      <P align=justify>The husband wrung his hands in uncontrollable' 
      agitation.</P>
      <P align=justify>"Oh! sir, sir," he cried. "Do not trifle. You do not 
      know. It is deadly. I know, and I give you my assurance that an operation 
      is absolutely necessary. Only the knife can save her." "And yet I am 
      inclined to wait," said Douglas Stone.</P>
      <P align=justify>"It is enough" the Turk cried, angrily. "Every minute is 
      of importance, and I cannot stand here and see wife allowed to sink. It on 
      remains for me to give you my thanks for having come, and to call in some 
      other surgeon before it is too late." Douglas Stone hesitated. To refund 
      that hundred pounds was no pleasant matter. But of course if he left the 
      case he must return the money. And if the Turk were right and the woman 
      died, his position before a coroner might be an embarrassing one. "You 
      have had personal experience of this poison?" he asked.</P>
      <P align=justify>"I have."</P>
      <P align=justify>"And you assure me that an operation is needful."</P>
      <P align=justify>"I swear it by all that I hold sacred."</P>
      <P align=justify>"The disfigurement will be frightful."</P>
      <P align=justify>"I can understand that the mouth will not be a pretty one 
      to kiss."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Douglas Stone turned fiercely upon the man. The speech 
      was a brutal one. But the Turk has his own fashion of talk and of thought, 
      and there was no time for wrangling. Douglas Stone drew a bistoury from 
      his case, opened it and felt the keen straight edge with his forefinger. 
      Then he held the lamp closer to the bed. Two dark eyes were gazing up at 
      him through the slit in the yashmak. They were all iris, and the pupil was 
      hardly to be seen. "You have given her a very heavy dose of opium."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Yes, she has had a good dose."</P>
      <P align=justify>He glanced again at the dark eyes which looked straight 
      at his own. They were dull and lustreless, but, even as he gazed, a little 
      shifting sparkle came into them, and the lips quivered. "She is not 
      absolutely unconscious," said he.</P>
      <P align=justify>"Would it not be well to use the knife while it will be 
      painless?"</P>
      <P align=justify>The same thought had crossed the surgeon's mind. He 
      grasped the wounded lip with his forceps, and with two swift cuts he took 
      out a broad V-shaped piece. The woman sprang up on the couch with a 
      dreadful gurgling scream. Her covering was torn from her face. It was a 
      face that he knew. In spite of that protruding upper lip and that slobber 
      of blood, it was a face that he knew. She kept on putting her hand up to 
      the gap and screaming. Douglas Stone sat down at the foot of the couch 
      with his knife and his forceps. The room was whirling round, and he had 
      felt something go like a ripping seam behind his ear. A bystander would 
      have said, that his face was the more ghastly of the two. As in a dream, 
      or as if he had been looking at something at the play, he was conscious 
      that the Turk's hair and beard lay upon the table, and that Lord Sannox 
      was leaning against the wall with his hand to his side, laughing silently. 
      The screams had died away now, and the dreadful head had dropped back 
      again upon the pillow, but Douglas Stone still sat motionless, and Lord 
      Sannox still chuckled quietly to himself. "It was really very necessary 
      for Marion, this operation," said he "not physically, but morally, you 
      know, morally."</P>
      <P align=justify>Douglas Stone stooped forwards and began to play with the 
      fringe of the coverlet. His knife tinkled down upon the ground, but he 
      still held the forceps and something more. "I had long intended to make a 
      little example," said Lord Sannox, suavely. "Your note of Wednesday 
      miscarried, and I have it here in my pocket-book. I took some pains in 
      carrying out my idea. The wound, by the way, was from nothing more 
      dangerous than my signet ring." He glanced keenly at his silent companion, 
      and cocked the small revolver which he held in his coat pocket. But 
      Douglas Stone was still picking at the coverlet.</P>
      <P align=justify>"You see you have kept your appointment after all," said 
      Lord Sannox.</P>
      <P align=justify>And at that Douglas Stone began to laugh. He laughed long 
      and loudly. But Lord Sannox did not laugh now. Something like fear 
      sharpened and hardened his features. He walked from the room, and he 
      walked on tiptoe. The old woman was waiting outside. "Attend to your 
      mistress when she awakes," said Lord Sannox.</P>
      <P align=justify>Then he went down to the street. The cab was at the door, 
      and the driver raised his hand to his hat.</P>
      <P align=justify>"John," said Lord Sannox, "you will take the doctor home 
      first. He will want leading downstairs, I think. Tell his butler that he 
      has been taken ill at a case."</P>
      <P align=justify>"Very good, sir." "Then you can take Lady Sannox home." 
      "And how about yourself, sir?"</P>
      <P>"Oh, my address for the next few months will be Hotel di Roma, Venice. 
      Just see that the letters are sent on. And tell Stevens to exhibit all the 
      purple chrysanthemums next Monday, and to wire me the result." </FONT></P>
