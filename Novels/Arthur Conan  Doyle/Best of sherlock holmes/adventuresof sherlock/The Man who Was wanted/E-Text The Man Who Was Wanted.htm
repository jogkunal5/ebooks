        <P align=justify>The Man Who Was Wanted</P></B>
        <P align=justify>by Arthur Whitaker</P>
        <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
        <P align=justify>During the late autumn of 'ninety-five a fortunate 
        chance enabled me to take some part in another of my friend Sherlock 
        Holmes's fascinating cases.</P>
        <P align=justify>My wife not having been well for some time, I had at 
        last persuaded her to take a holiday in Switzerland in the company of 
        her old school friend Kate Whitney, whose name may be remembered in 
        connection with the strange case I have already chronicled under the 
        title of "The Man with the Twisted Lip." My practice had grown much, and 
        I had been working very hard for many months and never felt in more need 
        myself of a rest and a holiday. Unfortunately I dared not absent myself 
        for a long enough period to warrant a visit to the Alps. I promised my 
        wife, however, that I would get a week or ten days' holiday in somehow, 
        and it was only on this understanding that she consented to the Swiss 
        tour I was so anxious for her to take. One of my best patients was in a 
        very critical state at the time, and it was not until August was gone 
        that he passed the crisis and began to recover. Feeling then that I 
        could leave my practice with a good conscience in the hands of a 
        <I>locum tenens, </I>I began to wonder where and how I should best find 
        the rest and change I needed.</P>
        <P align=justify>Almost at once the idea came to my mind that I would 
        hunt up my old friend Sherlock Holmes, of whom I had seen nothing for 
        several months. If he had no important inquiry in hand, I would do my 
        uttermost to persuade him tojoin me.</P>
        <P align=justify>Within half an hour of coming to this resolution I was 
        standing in the doorway of the familiar old room in Baker Street.</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes was stretched upon the couch with his back 
        towards me, the familiar dressing gown and old brier pipe as much in 
        evidence as of yore.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Come in, Watson," he cried, without glancing round. 
        "Come in and tell me what good wind blows you here?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"What an ear you have, Holmes," I said. "I don't think 
        that I could have recognized your tread so easily."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Nor I yours," said he, "if you hadn't come up my badly 
        lighted staircase taking the steps two at a time with all the 
        familiarity of an old fellow lodger; even then I might not have been 
        sure who it was, but when you stumbled over the new mat outside the door 
        which has been there for nearly three months, you needed no further 
        announcement."</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes pulled out two or three of the cushions from the 
        pile he was lying on and threw them across into the armchair. "Sit down, 
        Watson, and make yourself comfortable; you'll find cigarettes in a box 
        behind the clock."</P>
        <P align=justify>As I proceeded to comply, Holmes glanced whimsically 
        across at me. "I'm afraid I shall have to disappoint you, my boy," he 
        said. "I had a wire only half an hour ago which will prevent me from 
        joining in any little trip you may have been about to propose."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Really, Holmes," I said, "don't you think this is 
        going a little <I>too </I>far? I begin to fear you are a fraud and 
        pretend to discover things by observation, when all the time you really 
        do it by pure out-and-out clairvoyance!"</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes chuckled. "Knowing you as I do it's absurdly 
        simple," said he. "Your surgery hours are from five to seven, yet at six 
        o'clock you walk smiling into my rooms. Therefore you must have a 
        <I>locum </I>in. You are looking well, though tired, so the obvious 
        reason is that you are having, or about to have, a holiday. The clinical 
        thermometer, peeping out of your pocket, proclaims that you have been on 
        your rounds today, hence it's pretty evident that your real holiday 
        begins tomorrow. When, under these circumstances, you come hurrying into 
        my rooms—which, by the way, Watson, you haven't visited for nearly three 
        months—with a new Bradshaw and a timetable of excursion bookings bulging 
        out of your coat pocket, then it's more than probable you have come with 
        the idea of suggesting some joint expedition."</P>
        <P align=justify>"It's all perfectly true," I said, and explained to 
        him, in a few words, my plans. "And I'm more disappointed than I can 
        tell you," I concluded, "that you are not able to fall in with my little 
        scheme."</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes picked up a telegram from the table and looked 
        at it thoughtfully. "If only the inquiry this refers to promised to be 
        of anything like the interest of some we have gone into together, 
        nothing would have delighted me more than to have persuaded you to throw 
        your lot in with mine for a time; but really I'm afraid to do so, for it 
        sounds a particularly commonplace affair," and he crumpled the paper 
        into a ball and tossed it over to me.</P>
        <P align=justify>I smoothed it out and read: "To Holmes, 221B Baker 
        Street, London, S.W. Please come to Sheffield at once to inquire into 
        case of forgery. Jervis, Manager British Consolidated Bank."</P>
        <P align=justify>"I've wired back to say I shall go up to Sheffield by 
        the one-thirty-a.m. express from St. Pancras," said Holmes. "I can't go 
        sooner as I have an interesting little appointment to fulfill tonight 
        down in the East End, which should give me the last information I need 
        to trace home a daring robbery from the British Museum to its 
        instigator—who possesses one of the oldest titles and finest houses in 
        the country, along with a most insatiable greed, almost mania, for 
        collecting ancient documents. Before discussing the Sheffield affair any 
        further, however, we had perhaps better see what the evening paper has 
        to say about it," continued Holmes, as his boy entered with the 
        <I>Evening News, Standard, Globe, </I>and<I> Star</I>. "Ah, this must be 
        it," he said, pointing to a paragraph headed: "Daring Forger's 
        Remarkable Exploits in Sheffield."</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P align=justify>Whilst going to press we have been informed that a 
            series of most cleverly forged cheques have been successfully used 
            to swindle the Sheffield banks out of a sum which cannot be less 
            than six thousand pounds. The full extent of the fraud has not yet 
            been ascertained, and the managers of the different banks concerned, 
            who have been interviewed by our Sheffield correspondent, are very 
            reticent.</P>
            <P align=justify>It appears that a gentleman named Mr. Jabez Booth, 
            who resides at Broomhill, Sheffield, and has been an employee since 
            January I88I, at the British Consolidated Bank in Sheffield, 
            yesterday succeeded in cashing quite a number of cleverly forged 
            cheques at twelve of the principal banks in the city and absconding 
            with the proceeds.</P>
            <P align=justify>The crime appears to have been a strikingly 
            deliberate and well-thought-out one. Mr. Booth had, of course, in 
            his position in one of the principal banks in Sheffield, excellent 
            opportunities of studying the various signatures which he forged, 
            and he greatly facilitated his chances of easily and successfully 
            obtaining cash for the cheques by opening banking accounts last year 
            at each of the twelve banks at which he presented the forged 
            cheques, and by this means becoming personally known at each.</P>
            <P align=justify>He still further disarmed suspicion by crossing 
            each of the forged cheques and paying them into his account, while, 
            at the same time, he drew and cashed a cheque of his own for about 
            half the amount of the forged cheque paid in.</P>
            <P align=justify>It was not until early this morning, Thursday, that 
            the fraud was discovered, which means that the rascal has had some 
            twenty hours in which to make good his escape. In spite of this we 
            have little doubt but that he will soon be laid by the heels, for we 
            are informed that the finest detectives from Scotland Yard are 
            already upon his track, and it is also whispered that Mr. Sherlock 
            Holmes, the well-known and almost world-famed criminal expert of 
            Baker Street, has been asked to assist in hunting down this daring 
            forger.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=justify>"Then there follows a lengthy description of the 
        fellow, which I needn't read but will keep for future use," said Holmes, 
        folding the paper and looking across at me. "It seems to have been a 
        pretty smart affair. This Booth may not be easily caught for, though he 
        hasn't had a long time in which to make his escape, we mustn't lose 
        sight of the fact that he's had twelve months in which to plan how he 
        would do the vanishing trick when the time came. Well! What do you say, 
        Watson? Some of the little problems we have gone into in the past should 
        at least have taught us that the most interesting cases do not always 
        present the most bizarre features at the outset."</P>
        <P align=justify>"'So far from it, on the contrary, quite the reverse,' 
        to quote Sam Weller," I replied. "Personally nothing would be more to my 
        taste than to join you."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Then we'll consider it settled," said my friend. "And 
        now I must go and attend to that other little matter of business I spoke 
        to you about. Remember," he said, as we parted, "one-thirty at St. 
        Pancras."</P>
        <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
        <P align=justify>I was on the platform in good time, but it<B> </B>was 
        not until the hands of the great station clock indicated the very moment 
        due for our departure, and the porters were beginning to slam the 
        carriage doors noisily, that I caught the familiar sight of Holmes's 
        tall figure.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Ah! here you are, Watson," he cried cheerily. "I fear 
        you must have thought I was going to be too late. I've had a very busy 
        evening and no time to waste; however, I've succeeded in putting into 
        practice Phileas Fogg's theory that ‘a well-used minimum suffices for 
        everything,' and here I am.</P>
        <P align=justify>"About the last thing I should expect of you," I said 
        as we settled down into two opposite corners of an otherwise empty 
        first-class carriage, "would be that you should do such an unmethodical 
        thing as to miss a train. The only thing which would surprise me more, 
        in fact, would be to see you at the station ten minutes before 
time."</P>
        <P align=justify>"I should consider that the greatest evil of the two," 
        said Holmes sententiously. "But now we must sleep; we have every 
        prospect of a heavy day."</P>
        <P align=justify>It was one of Holmes's characteristics that he could 
        command sleep at will; unfortunately he could resist it at will also, 
        and often have I had to remonstrate with him on the harm he must be 
        doing himself, when, deeply engrossed in one of his strange or baffling 
        problems, he would go for several consecutive days and nights without 
        one wink of sleep.</P>
        <P align=justify>He put the shades over the lamps, leaned back in his 
        corner, and in less than two minutes his regular breathing told me he 
        was fast asleep. Not being blessed with the same gift myself, I lay back 
        in my corner for some time, nodding to the rhythmical throb of the 
        express as it hurled itself forward through the darkness. Now and again 
        as we shot through some brilliantly illuminated station or past a line 
        of flaming furnaces, I caught for an instant a glimpse of Holmes's 
        figure coiled up snugly in the far corner with his head sunk upon his 
        breast.</P>
        <P align=justify>It was not until after we had passed Nottingham that I 
        really fell asleep and, when a more than usually violent lurch of the 
        train over some points woke me again, it was broad daylight, and Holmes 
        was sitting up, busy with a Bradshaw and boat timetable. As I moved, he 
        glanced across at me.</P>
        <P align=justify>"If I'm not mistaken, Watson, that was the Dore and 
        Totley tunnel through which we have just come, and if so we shall be in 
        Sheffield in a few minutes. As you see, I've not been wasting my time 
        altogether, but studying my Bradshaw, which, by the way, Watson, is the 
        most useful book published, without exception, to anyone of my 
        calling."</P>
        <P align=justify>"How can it possibly help you now?" I asked in some 
        surprise.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Well, it may or it may not," said Holmes thoughtfully. 
        "But in any case it's well to have at one's finger tips all knowledge 
        which may be of use. It's quite probable that this Jabez Booth may have 
        decided to leave the country and, if this supposition is correct, he 
        would undoubtedly time his little escapade in conformity with 
        information contained in this useful volume. Now, I learn from this 
        Sheffield <I>Telegraph, </I>which I obtained at Leicester, by the way, 
        when you were fast asleep, that Mr. Booth cashed the last of his forged 
        cheques at the North British Bank in Saville Street at precisely 
        two-fifteen p.m. on Wednesday last. He made the round of the various 
        banks he visited in a hansom, and it would take him about three minutes 
        only to get from this bank to the G. C. station. From what I gather of 
        the order in which the different banks were visited, he made a circuit, 
        finishing at the nearest point to the G.C. station, at which he could 
        arrive at about two-eighteen. Now, I find that at two-twenty-two a boat 
        express would leave Sheffield G.C., due in Liverpool at four-twenty, and 
        in connection with it the White Star liner <I>Empress Queen </I>should 
        have sailed from Liverpool docks at six-thirty for New York. Or again at 
        two-forty-five a boat train would leave Sheffield for Hull, at which 
        town it was due at four-thirty, in time to make a connection with the 
        Holland steam packet, <I>Comet, </I>sailing at six-thirty for 
        Amsterdam.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Here we are provided with two not unlikely means of 
        escape, the former being the most probable; but both worth bearing in 
        mind."</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes had scarcely finished speaking when the train 
        drew up.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Nearly five past four," I remarked.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Yes," said Holmes, "we are exactly one and a half 
        minutes behind time. And now I propose a good breakfast and a cup of 
        strong coffee, for we have at least a couple of hours to spare."</P>
        <P align=justify>After breakfast<B> </B>we visited first the police 
        station where we learned that no further developments had taken place in 
        the matter we had come to investigate. Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard had 
        arrived the previous evening and had taken the case in hand 
        officially.</P>
        <P align=justify>We obtained the address of Mr. Jervis, the manager of 
        the bank at which Booth had been an employee, and also that of his 
        landlady at Broomhill.</P>
        <P align=justify>A hansom landed us at Mr. Jervis's house at Fulwood at 
        seven-thirty. Holmes insisted upon my accompanying him, and we were both 
        shown into a spacious drawing room and asked to wait until the banker 
        could see us.</P>
        <P align=justify>Mr. Jervis, a stout, florid gentleman of about fifty, 
        came puffing into the room in a very short time. An atmosphere of 
        prosperity seemed to envelop, if not actually to emanate from him.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Pardon me for keeping you waiting, gentlemen," he 
        said, "but the hour is an early one."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Indeed, Mr. jervis," said Holmes, "no apology is 
        needed unless it be on our part. It is, however, necessary that I should 
        ask you a few questions concerning this affair of Mr. Booth, before I 
        can proceed in the matter, and that must be our excuse for paying you 
        such an untimely visit."</P>
        <P align=justify>"I shall be most happy to answer your questions as far 
        as it lies in my power to do so," said the banker, his fat fingers 
        playing with a bunch of seals at the end of his massive gold watch 
        chain.</P>
        <P align=justify>"When did Mr. Booth first enter your bank?" said 
        Holmes.</P>
        <P align=justify>"In January 1881."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Do you know where he lived when he first came to 
        Sheffield?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"He took lodgings at Ashgate Road, and has, I believe, 
        lived there ever since."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Do you know anything of his history or life before he 
        came to you?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Very little, I fear; beyond that his parents were both 
        dead, and that he came to us with the best testimonials from one of the 
        Leeds branches of our bank, I know nothing."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Did you find him quick and reliable?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"He was one of the best and smartest men I have ever 
        had in my employ."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Do you know whether he was conversant with any other 
        language besides English?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"I feel pretty sure he wasn't. We have one clerk who 
        attends to any foreign correspondence we may have, and I know that Booth 
        has repeatedly passed letters and papers on to him."</P>
        <P align=justify>"With your experience of banking matters, Mr. Jervis, 
        how long a time do you think he might reasonably have calculated would 
        elapse between the presentation of the forged cheques and their 
        detection?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Well, that would depend very largely upon 
        circumstances," said Mr. Jervis. "In the case of a single cheque it 
        might be a week or two, unless the amounts were so large as to call for 
        special inquiry, in which case it would probably never be cashed at all 
        until such inquiry had been made. In the present case, when there were a 
        dozen forged cheques, it was most unlikely that some one of them should 
        not be detected within twenty-four hours and so lead to the discovery of 
        the fraud. No sane person would dare to presume upon the crime remaining 
        undetected for a longer period than that."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Thanks," said Holmes, rising. "Those were the chief 
        points I wished to speak to you about. I will communicate to you any 
        news of importance I may have."</P>
        <P align=justify>"I am deeply obliged to you, Mr. Holmes. The case is 
        naturally causing us great anxiety. We leave it entirely to your 
        discretion to take whatever steps you may consider best. Oh, by the way, 
        I sent instructions to Booth's landlady to disturb nothing in his rooms 
        until you had had an opportunity of examining them."</P>
        <P align=justify>"That was a very wise thing to do," said Holmes, "and 
        may be the means of helping us materially."</P>
        <P align=justify>"I am also instructed by my company," said the banker, 
        as he bowed us politely out, "to ask you to make a note of any expenses 
        incurred, which they will of course immediately defray."</P>
        <P align=justify>A few moments later we were ringing the bell of the 
        house in Ashgate Road, Broomhill, at which Mr. Booth had been a lodger 
        for over seven years. It was answered by a maid who informed us that 
        Mrs. Purnell was engaged with a gentleman upstairs. When we explained 
        our errand she showed us at once up to Mr. Booth's rooms, on the first 
        floor, where we found Mrs. Purnell, a plump, voluble, little lady of 
        about forty, in conversation with Mr. Lestrade, who appeared to be just 
        concluding his examination of the rooms.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Good morning, Holmes," said the detective, with a very 
        self-satisfied air. "You arrive on the scene a little too late; I fancy 
        I have already got all the information needed to catch our man!"</P>
        <P align=justify>"I'm delighted to hear it," said Holmes dryly, "and 
        must indeed congratulate you, if this is actually the case. Perhaps 
        after I've made a little tour of inspection we can compare notes."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Just as you please," said Lestrade, with the air of 
        one who can afford to be gracious. "Candidly, I think you will be 
        wasting time, and so would you if you knew what I've discovered."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Still, I must ask you to humour my little whim," said 
        Holmes, leaning against the mantelpiece and whistling softly as he 
        looked round the room.</P>
        <P align=justify>After a moment he turned to Mrs. Purnell. "The 
        furniture of this room belongs, of course, to you?"</P>
        <P align=justify>Mrs. Purnell assented.</P>
        <P align=justify>"The picture that was taken down from over the 
        mantelpiece last Wednesday morning," continued Holmes, "that belonged to 
        Mr. Booth, I presume?"</P>
        <P align=justify>I followed Holmes's glance across to where an unfaded 
        patch on the wallpaper clearly indicated that a picture had recently 
        been hanging. Well as I knew my friend's methods of reasoning, however, 
        I did not realize for a moment that the little bits of spiderweb which 
        had been behind the picture, and were still clinging to the wall, had 
        told him that the picture could only have been taken down immediately 
        before Mrs. Purnell had received orders to disturb nothing in the room; 
        otherwise her brush, evidently busy enough elsewhere, would not have 
        spared them.</P>
        <P align=justify>The good lady stared at Sherlock Holmes in openmouthed 
        astonishment. "Mr. Booth took it down himself on Wednesday morning," she 
        said. "It was a picture he had painted himself, and he thought no end of 
        it. He wrapped it up and took it out with him, remarking that he was 
        going to give it to a friend. I was very much surprised at the time, for 
        I knew he valued it very much; in fact he once told me that he wouldn't 
        part with it for anything. Of course, it's easy to see now why he got 
        rid of it."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Yes," said Holmes. "It wasn't a large picture, I see. 
        Was it a water colour?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Yes, a painting of a stretch of moorland, with three 
        or four large rocks arranged like a big table on a bare hilltop. 
        Druidicals, Mr. Booth called them, or something like that."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Did Mr. Booth do much painting, then?" enquired 
        Holmes.</P>
        <P align=justify>"None, whilst he's been here, sir. He has told me he 
        used to do a good deal as a lad, but he had given it up."</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes's eyes were glancing round the room again, and 
        an exclamation of surprise escaped him as they encountered a photo 
        standing on the piano.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Surely that’s a photograph of Mr. Booth," he said. "It 
        exactly resembles the description I have of him?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Yes," said Mrs. Purnell, "and a very good one it is 
        too."</P>
        <P align=justify>"How long has it been taken?" said Holmes, picking it 
        up.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Oh, only a few weeks, sir. I was here when the boy 
        from the photographer's brought them up. Mr. Booth opened the packet 
        whilst I was in the room. There were only two photos, that one and 
        another which he gave to me."</P>
        <P align=justify>"You interest me exceedingly," said Holmes. "This 
        striped lounge suit he is wearing. Is it the same that he had on when he 
        left Wednesday morning?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Yes, he was dressed just like that, as far as I can 
        remember."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Do you recollect anything of importance that Mr. Booth 
        said to you last Wednesday before he went out?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Not very much, I'm afraid, sir. When I took his cup of 
        chocolate up to his bedroom, he said——"</P>
        <P align=justify>"One moment," interrupted Holmes. "Did Mr. Booth 
        usually have a cup of chocolate in the morning?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Oh, yes, sir, summer and winter alike. He was very 
        particular about it and would ring for it as soon as ever he waked. I 
        believe he'd rather have gone without his breakfast almost than have 
        missed his cup of chocolate. Well, as I was saying, sir, I took it up to 
        him myself on Wednesday morning, and he made some remark about the 
        weather and then, just as I was leaving the room, he said, 'Oh, by the 
        way, Mrs. Purnell, I shall be going away tonight for a couple of weeks. 
        I've packed my bag and will call for it this afternoon."'</P>
        <P align=justify>"No doubt you were very much surprised at this sudden 
        announcement?" queried Holmes.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Not very much, sir. Ever since he's had this auditing 
        work to do for the branch banks, there's been no knowing when he would 
        be away. Of course, he'd never been off for two weeks at a stretch, 
        except at holiday times, but he had so often been away for a few days at 
        a time that I had got used to his popping off with hardly a moment's 
        notice."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Let me see, how long has he had this extra work at the 
        bank—several months, hasn't he?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"More. It was about last Christmas, I believe, when 
        they gave it to him."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Oh, yes, of course," said Holmes carelessly, "and this 
        work naturally took him from home a good deal?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Yes, indeed, and it seemed to quite tire him, so much 
        evening and night work too, you see, sir. It was enough to knock him 
        out, for he was always such a very quiet, retiring gentleman and hardly 
        ever used to go out in the evenings before."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Has Mr. Booth left many of his possessions behind 
        him?" asked Holmes.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Very few, indeed, and what he has are mostly old 
        useless things. But he's a most honest thief, sir," said Mrs. Purnell 
        paradoxically, "and paid me his rent, before he went out on Wednesday 
        morning, right up to next Saturday, because he wouldn't be back by 
        then."</P>
        <P align=justify>"That was good of him," said Holmes, smiling 
        thoughtfully. "By the way, do you happen to know if he gave away any 
        other treasures before he left?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Well, not <I>just</I> before, but during the last few 
        months he's taken away most of his books and sold them, I think, a few 
        at a time. He had rather a fancy for old books and has told me that some 
        editions he had were worth quite a lot."</P>
        <P align=justify>During this conversation, Lestrade had been sitting 
        drumming his fingers impatiently on the table. Now he got up. "Really, I 
        fear I shall have to leave you to this gossip," he said. "I must go and 
        wire instructions for the arrest of Mr. Booth. If only you would have 
        looked before at this old blotter, which I found in the wastebasket, you 
        would have saved yourself a good deal of unnecessary trouble, Mr. 
        Holmes," and he triumphantly slapped down a sheet of wellused blotting 
        paper on the table.</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes picked it up and held it in front of a mirror 
        over the sideboard. Looking over his shoulder I could plainly read the 
        reflected impression of a note written in Mr. Booth's handwriting, of 
        which Holmes had procured samples.</P>
        <P align=justify>It was to a booking agency in Liverpool, giving 
        instructions to them to book a first-class private cabin and passage on 
        board the <I>Empress Queen </I>from Liverpool to New York. Parts of the 
        note were slightly obliterated by other impressions, but it went on to 
        say that a cheque was enclosed to pay for tickets, etc., and it was 
        signed by J. Booth.</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes stood silently scrutinizing the paper for 
        several minutes.</P>
        <P align=justify>It was a well-used sheet, but fortunately the 
        impression of the note was well in the centre, and hardly obliterated at 
        all by the other marks and blots, which were all round the outer 
        circumference of the paper. In one corner the address of the Liverpool 
        booking agency was plainly decipherable, the paper evidently having been 
        used to blot the envelope with also.</P>
        <P align=justify>"My dear Lestrade, you have indeed been more fortunate 
        than I had imagined," said Holmes at length, handing the paper back to 
        him. "May I ask what steps you propose to take next?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"I shall cable at once to the New York police to arrest 
        the fellow as soon as he arrives," said Lestrade, "but first I must make 
        quite certain the boat doesn't touch at Queenstown or anywhere and give 
        him a chance of slipping through our fingers."</P>
        <P align=justify>"It doesn't," said Holmes quietly. "I had already 
        looked to see as I thought it not unlikely, at first, that Mr. Booth 
        might have intended to sail by the <I>Empress Queen."</P></I>
        <P align=justify>Lestrade gave me a wink for which I would dearly have 
        liked to have knocked him down, for I could see that he disbelieved my 
        friend. I felt a keen pang of disappointment that Holmes's foresight 
        should have been eclipsed in this way by what, after all, was mere good 
        luck on Lestrade's part.</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes had turned to Mrs. Purnell and was thanking 
        her.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Don't mention it, sir," she said. "Mr. Booth deserves 
        to be caught, though I must say he's always been a gentleman to me. I 
        only wish I could have given you some more useful information."</P>
        <P align=justify>"On the contrary," said Holmes, "I can assure you that 
        what you have told us has been of the utmost importance and will very 
        materially help us. It's just occurred to me, by the way, to wonder if 
        you could possibly put up my friend Dr. Watson and myself for a few 
        days, until we have had time to look into this little matter?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Certainly, sir, I shall be most happy."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Good," said Holmes. "Then you may expect us back to 
        dinner about seven."</P>
        <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
        <P align=justify>When we got outside, Lestrade at once announced his 
        intention of going to the police office and arranging for the necessary 
        orders for Booth's detention and arrest to be cabled to the head of the 
        New York police; Holmes retained an enigmatical silence as to what he 
        proposed to do but expressed his determination to remain at Broomhill 
        and make a few further inquiries. He insisted, however, upon going 
        alone.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Remember, Watson, you are here for a rest and holiday 
        and I can assure you that if you did remain with me you would only find 
        my program a dull one. Therefore, I insist upon your finding some more 
        entertaining way of spending the remainder of the day."</P>
        <P align=justify>Past experience told me that it was quite useless to 
        remonstrate or argue with Holmes when once his mind was made up, so I 
        consented with the best grace I could, and leaving Holmes, drove off in 
        the hansom, which he assured me he would not require further.</P>
        <P align=justify>I passed a few hours in the art gallery and museum and 
        then, after lunch, had a brisk walk out on the Manchester Road and 
        enjoyed the fresh air and moorland scenery, returning to Ashgate Road at 
        seven with better appetite than I had been blessed with for months.</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes had not returned, and it was nearly half past 
        seven before he came in. I could see at once that he was in one of his 
        most reticent moods, and all my inquiries failed to elicit any 
        particulars of how he had passed his time or what he thought about the 
        case.</P>
        <P align=justify>The whole evening he remained coiled up in an easy 
        chair, puffing at his pipe, and hardly a word could I get from him.</P>
        <P align=justify>His inscrutable countenance and persistent silence gave 
        me no clue whatever as to his thought on the enquiry he had in hand, 
        although I could see his whole mind was concentrated upon it.</P>
        <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
        <P align=justify>Next morning, just as we had finished breakfast, the 
        maid entered with a note. "From Mr. Jervis, sir; there's no answer," she 
        said.</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes tore open the envelope and scanned the note 
        hurriedly and, as he did so, I noticed a flush of annoyance spread over 
        his usually pale face.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Confound his impudence," he muttered. "Read that, 
        Watson. I don't ever remember to have been treated so badly in a case 
        before."</P>
        <P align=justify>The note was a brief one:</P>

              <BLOCKQUOTE>
                <P align=justify>Mr. Jervis, on behalf of the directors of the 
                British Consolidated Bank, begs to thank Mr. Sherlock Holmes for 
                his prompt attention and valued services in the matter 
                concerning the fraud and disappearance of their ex-employee, Mr. 
                Jabez Booth.</P>
                <P align=justify>Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, informs us that 
                he has succeeded in tracking the individual in question who will 
                be arrested shortly. Under these circumstances they feel it 
                unnecessary to take up any more of Mr. Holmes's valuable 
                time.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=justify>"Rather cool, eh, Watson? I'm much mistaken if they 
        don't have cause to regret their action when it's too late. After this I 
        shall certainly refuse to act for them any further in the case, even if 
        they ask me to do so. In a way I'm sorry because the matter presented 
        some distinctly interesting features and is by no means the simple 
        affair our friend Lestrade thinks."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Why, don't you think he is on the right scent?" I 
        exclaimed.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Wait and see, Watson," said Holmes mysteriously. "Mr. 
        Booth hasn't been caught yet, remember." And that was all that I could 
        get out of him.</P>
        <P align=justify>One result of the summary way in which the banker had 
        dispensed with my friend's services was that Holmes and I spent a most 
        restful and enjoyable week in the small village of Hathersage, on the 
        edge of the Derbyshire moors, and returned to London feeling better for 
        our long moorland rambles.</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes having very little work in hand at the time, and 
        my wife not yet having returned from her Swiss holiday, I prevailed upon 
        him, though not without considerable difficulty, to pass the next few 
        weeks with me instead of returning to his rooms at Baker Street.</P>
        <P align=justify>Of course, we watched the development of the Sheffield 
        forgery case with the keenest interest. Somehow the particulars of 
        Lestrade's discoveries got into the papers, and the day after we left 
        Sheffield they were full of the exciting chase of Mr. Booth, the man 
        wanted for the Sheffield bank frauds.</P>
        <P align=justify>They spoke of "the guilty man restlessly pacing the 
        deck of the <I>Empress Queen, </I>as she ploughed her way majestically 
        across the solitary wastes of the Atlantic, all unconscious that the 
        inexorable hand of justice could stretch over the ocean and was already 
        waiting to seize him on his arrival in the New World." And Holmes after 
        reading these sensational paragraphs would always lay down the paper 
        with one of his enigmatical smiles.</P>
        <P align=justify>At last the day on which the <I>Empress Queen </I>was 
        due at New York arrived, and I could not help but notice that even 
        Holmes's usually inscrutable face wore a look of suppressed excitement 
        as he unfolded the evening paper. But our surprise was doomed to be 
        prolonged still further. There was a brief paragraph to say that the 
        <I>Empress Queen </I>had arrived off Long Island at Six a.m.<B> 
        </B>after a good passage. There was, however, a case of cholera on 
        board, and the New York authorities had consequently been compelled to 
        put the boat in quarantine, and none of the passengers or crew would be 
        allowed to leave her for a period of twelve days.</P>
        <P align=justify>Two days later there was a full column in the papers 
        stating that it had been definitely ascertained that Mr. Booth was 
        really on board the <I>Empress Queen. </I>He had been identified and 
        spoken to by one of the sanitary inspectors who had had to visit the 
        boat. He was being kept under close observation, and there was no 
        possible chance of his escaping. Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard, by whom 
        Booth had been so cleverly tracked down and his escape forestalled, had 
        taken passage on the <I>Oceania, </I>due in New York on the tenth, and 
        would personally arrest Mr. Booth when he was allowed to land.</P>
        <P align=justify>Never before or since have I seen my friend Holmes so 
        astonished as when he had finished reading this announcement. I could 
        see that he was thoroughly mystified, though why he should be so was 
        quite a puzzle to me. All day he sat coiled up in an easy chair, with 
        his brows drawn down into two hard lines and his eyes half closed as he 
        puffed away at his oldest brier in silence.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Watson," he said once, glancing across at me, "it's 
        perhaps a good thing that I was asked to drop that Sheffield case. As 
        things are turning out I fancy I should only have made a fool of 
        myself."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Why?" I asked.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Because I began by assuming that somebody else wasn't 
        one—and now it looks as though I had been mistaken."</P>
        <P align=justify>For the next few days Holmes seemed quite depressed, 
        for nothing annoyed him more than to feel that he had made any mistake 
        in his deductions or got onto a false line of reasoning.</P>
        <P align=justify>At last the fatal tenth of September, the day on which 
        Booth was to be arrested, arrived. Eagerly but in vain we scanned the 
        evening papers. The morning of the eleventh came and still brought no 
        news of the arrest, but in the evening papers of that day there was a 
        short paragraph hinting that the criminal had escaped again.</P>
        <P align=justify>For several days the papers were full of the most 
        conflicting rumours and conjectures as to what had actually taken place, 
        but all were agreed in affirming that Mr. Lestrade was on his way home 
        alone and would be back in Liverpool on the seventeenth or 
        eighteenth.</P>
        <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
        <P align=justify>On the evening of the last named day Holmes and I sat 
        smoking in his Baker Street rooms, when his boy came in to announce that 
        Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard was below and would like the favour of a 
        few minutes' conversation.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Show him up, show him up," said Holmes, rubbing his 
        hands together with an excitement quite unusual to him.</P>
        <P align=justify>Lestrade entered the room and sat down in the seat to 
        which Holmes waved him, with a most dejected air.</P>
        <P align=justify>"It's not often I'm at fault, Mr. Holmes," he began, 
        "but in this Sheffield business I've been beaten hollow."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Dear me," said Holmes pleasantly, "you surely don't 
        mean to tell me that you haven't got your man yet."</P>
        <P align=justify>"I do," said Lestrade. "What's more, I don't think he 
        ever will be caught!"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Don't despair so soon," said Holmes encouragingly. 
        "After you have told us all that's already happened, it's just within 
        the bounds of possibility that I may be able to help you with some 
        little suggestions."</P>
        <P align=justify>Thus encouraged, Lestrade began his strange story to 
        which we both listened with breathless interest.</P>
        <P align=justify>"It's quite unnecessary for me to dwell upon incidents 
        which are already familiar," he said. "You know of the discovery I made 
        in Sheffield which, of course, convinced me that the man I wanted had 
        sailed for New York on the <I>Empress Queen. </I>I was in a fever of 
        impatience for his arrest, and when I heard that the boat he had taken 
        passage on had been placed in quarantine, I set off at once in order 
        that I might actually lay hands upon him myself. Never have five days 
        seemed so long.</P>
        <P align=justify>"We reached New York on the evening of the ninth, and I 
        rushed off at once to the head of the New York police and from him 
        learned that there was no doubt whatever that Mr. Jabez Booth was indeed 
        on board the <I>Empress Queen. </I>One of the sanitary inspectors who 
        had had to visit the boat had not only seen but actually spoken to him. 
        The man exactly answered the description of Booth which had appeared in 
        the papers. One of the New York detectives had been sent on board to 
        make a few inquiries and to inform the captain privately of the 
        impending arrest. He found that Mr. jabez Booth had actually had the 
        audacity to book his passage and travel under his real name without even 
        attempting to disguise himself in any way. He had a private first-class 
        cabin, and the purser declared that he had been suspicious of the man 
        from the first. He had kept himself shut up in his cabin nearly all the 
        time, posing as an eccentric semi-invalid person who must not be 
        disturbed on any account. Most of his meals had been sent down to his 
        cabin, and he had been seen on deck but seldom and hardly ever dined 
        with the rest of the passengers. It was quite evident that he had been 
        trying to keep out of sight, and to attract as little attention as 
        possible. The stewards and some of the passengers who were approached on 
        the subject later were all agreed that this was the case.</P>
        <P align=justify>"It was decided that during the time the boat was in 
        quarantine nothing should be said to Booth to arouse his suspicions but 
        that the pursers, steward, and captain, who were the only persons in the 
        secret, should between them keep him under observation until the tenth, 
        the day on which passengers would be allowed to leave the boat. On that 
        day he should be arrested."</P>
        <P align=justify>Here we were interrupted by Holmes's boy, who came in 
        with a telegram. Holmes glanced at it with a faint smile.</P>
        <P align=justify>"No answer," he said, slipping it in his waistcoat 
        pocket. "Pray continue your very interesting story, Lestrade."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Well, on the afternoon of the tenth, accompanied by 
        the New York chief inspector of police and detective Forsyth," resumed 
        Lestrade, "I went on board the <I>Empress Queen </I>half an hour before 
        she was due to come up to the landing stage to allow passengers to 
        disembark.</P>
        <P align=justify>"The purser informed us that Mr. Booth had been on deck 
        and that he had been in conversation with him about fifteen minutes 
        before our arrival. He had then gone down to his cabin and the purser, 
        making some excuse to go down also, had actually seen him enter it. He 
        had been standing near the top of the companionway since then and was 
        sure Booth had not come up on deck again since.</P>
        <P align=justify>"'At last,' I muttered to myself, as we all went down 
        below, led by the purser, who took us straight to Booth's cabin. We 
        knocked but, getting no answer, tried the door and found it locked. The 
        purser assured us, however, that this was nothing unusual. Mr. Booth had 
        had his cabin door locked a good deal and, often, even his meals had 
        been left on a tray outside. We held a hurried consultation and, as time 
        was short, decided to force the door. Two good blows with a heavy hammer 
        broke it from the hinges, and we all rushed in. You can picture our 
        astonishment when we found the cabin empty. We searched it thoroughly, 
        and Booth was certainly not there."</P>
        <P align=justify>"One moment," interrupted Holmes. "The key of the 
        door-was it on the inside of the lock or not?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"It was nowhere to be seen," said Lestrade. "I was 
        getting frantic for, by this time, I could feel the vibration of the 
        engines and hear the first churning sound of the screw as the great boat 
        began to slide slowly down towards the landing stage.</P>
        <P align=justify>"We were at our wits' end; Mr. Booth must be hiding 
        somewhere on board, but there was now no time to make a proper search 
        for him, and in a very few minutes passengers would be leaving the boat. 
        At last the captain promised us that, under the circumstances, only one 
        landing gangway should be run out and, in company with the purser and 
        stewards, I should stand by it with a complete list of passengers, 
        ticking off each one as he or she left. By this means it would be quite 
        impossible for Booth to escape us even if he attempted some disguise, 
        for no person whatever would be allowed to cross the gangway until 
        identified by the purser or one of the stewards.</P>
        <P align=justify>"I was delighted with the arrangement, for there was 
        now no way by which Booth could give me the slip.</P>
        <P align=justify>"One by one the passengers crossed the gangway and 
        joined the jostling crowd on the landing stage and each one was 
        identified and his or her name crossed off my list. There were one 
        hundred and ninety-three first-class passengers on board the <I>Empress 
        Queen, </I>including Booth, and, when one hundred and ninety-two had 
        disembarked, his was the only name which remained!</P>
        <P align=justify>"You can scarcely realize what a fever of impatience we 
        were in," said Lestrade, mopping his brow at the very recollection, "nor 
        how interminable the time seemed as we slowly but carefully ticked off 
        one by one the whole of the three hundred and twenty-four second-class 
        passengers and the three hundred and ten steerage from my list. Every 
        passenger except Mr. Booth crossed that gangway, but he certainly did 
        not do so. There was no possible room for doubt on that point.</P>
        <P align=justify>"He must therefore be still on the boat, we agreed, but 
        I was getting panic-stricken and wondered if there were any possibility 
        of his getting smuggled off in some of the luggage which the great 
        cranes were now beginning to swing up onto the pier.</P>
        <P align=justify>"I hinted my fear to detective Forsyth, and he at once 
        arranged that every trunk or box in which there was any chance for a man 
        to hide should be opened and examined by the customs officers.</P>
        <P align=justify>"It was a tedious business, but they didn't shirk it, 
        and at the end of two hours were able to assure us that by no 
        possibility could Booth have been smuggled off the boat in this way.</P>
        <P align=justify>"This left only one possible solution to the mystery. 
        He <I>must</I> be still in hiding somewhere on board. We had had the 
        boat kept under the closest observation ever since she came up to the 
        landing stage, and now the superintendent of police lent us a staff of 
        twenty men and, with the consent of the captain and the assistance of 
        the pursers and stewards, etc., the <I>Empress Queen </I>was searched 
        and re-searched from stem to stern. We didn't leave unexamined a place 
        in which a cat could have hidden, but the missing man wasn't there. Of 
        that I'm certain—and there you have the whole mystery in a nutshell, Mr. 
        Holmes. Mr. Booth certainly <I>was </I>on board the <I>Empress Queen 
        </I>up to, and at, eleven o'clock on the morning of the tenth, and 
        although he could not by any possibility have left it, we are 
        nevertheless face to face with the fact that he wasn't there at five 
        o'clock in the afternoon."</P>
        <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
        <P align=justify>Lestrade’s Face, as he concluded his curious and 
        mysterious narrative, bore a look of the most hopeless bewilderment I 
        ever saw, and I fancy my own must have pretty well matched it, but 
        Holmes threw himself back in his easy chair, with his long thin legs 
        stuck straight out in front of him, his whole frame literally shaking 
        with silent laughter. "What conclusion have you come to?" he gasped at 
        length. "What steps do you propose to take next?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"I've no idea. Who could know what to do? The whole 
        thing is impossible, perfectly impossible; it's an insoluble mystery. I 
        came to you to see if you could, by any chance, suggest some entirely 
        fresh line of inquiry upon which I might begin to work."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Well," said Holmes, cocking his eye mischievously 
        at<B> </B>the bewildered Lestrade, "I can give you Booth's present 
        address, if it will be of any use to you?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"His what!" cried Lestrade.</P>
        <P align=justify>"His present address," repeated Holmes quietly. "But 
        before I do so, my dear Lestrade, I must make one stipulation. Mr. 
        Jervis has treated me very shabbily in the matter, and I don't desire 
        that my name shall be associated with it any further. Whatever you do 
        you must not hint the source from which any information I may give you 
        has come. You promise?"</P>
        <P align=justify>"Yes," murmured Lestrade, who was in a state of 
        bewildered excitement.</P>
        <P align=justify>Holmes tore a leaf from his pocket book and scribbled 
        on it: Mr. A. Winter, c/o Mrs. Thackary, Glossop Road, Broomhill, 
        Sheffield.</P>
        <P align=justify>"You will find there the present name and address of 
        the man you are in search of," he said, handing the paper across to 
        Lestrade. "I should strongly advise you to lose no time in getting hold 
        of him, for though the wire I received a short time ago—which 
        unfortunately interrupted your most interesting narrative—was to tell me 
        that Mr. Winter had arrived back home again after a temporary absence, 
        still it's more than probable that he will leave there, for good, at an 
        early date. I can't say how soon—not for a few days, I should 
think."</P>
        <P align=justify>Lestrade rose. "Mr. Holmes, you're a brick," he said, 
        with more real feeling than I have ever seen him show before. "You've 
        saved my reputation in this job just when I was beginning to look like a 
        perfect fool, and now you're forcing me to take all the credit, when I 
        don't deserve one atom. As to how you have found this out, it's as great 
        a mystery to me as Booth's disappearance was."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Well, as to that," said Holmes airily, "I can't be 
        sure of all the facts myself, for of course I've never looked properly 
        into the case. But they are pretty easy to conjecture, and I shall be 
        most happy to give you my idea of Booth's trip to New York on some 
        future occasion when you have more time to spare.</P>
        <P align=justify>"By the way," called out Holmes, as Lestrade was 
        leaving the room, "I shouldn't be surprised if you find Mr. Jabez Booth, 
        <I>alias </I>Mr. Archibald Winter, a slight acquaintance of yours, for 
        he would undoubtedly be a fellow passenger of yours, on your homeward 
        journey from America. He reached Sheffield a few hours before you 
        arrived in London and, as he has certainly just returned from New York, 
        like yourself, it's evident you must have crossed on the same boat. He 
        would be wearing smoked glasses and have a heavy dark moustache."</P>
        <P align=justify>"Ah! " said Lestrade, "there <I>was </I>a man called 
        Winter on board who answered to that description. I believe it must have 
        been he, and I'll lose no more time," and Lestrade hurried off.</P>
        <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
        <P align=justify>"Well, Watson, my boy, you look nearly as bewildered as 
        our friend Lestrade," said Holmes, leaning back in his chair and looking 
        roguishly across at me, as he lighted his old brier pipe.</P>
        <P align=justify>"I must confess that none of the problems you have had 
        to solve, in the past, seemed more inexplicable to me than Lestrade's 
        account of Booth's disappearance from the <I>Empress Queen. "</P></I>
        <P align=justify>"Yes, that part of the story is decidedly neat," 
        chuckled Holmes, "but I'll tell you how I got at the solution of the 
        mystery. I see you are ready to listen.</P>
        <P align=justify>"The first thing to do in any case is to gauge the 
        intelligence and cunning of the criminal. Now, Mr. Booth was undoubtedly 
        a clever man. Mr. Jervis himself, you remember, assured us as much. The 
        fact that he opened banking accounts in preparation for the crime twelve 
        months before he committed it proves it to have been a long-premeditated 
        one. I began the case, therefore, with the knowledge that I had a clever 
        man to catch, who had had twelve months in which to plan his escape.</P>
        <P align=justify>"My first real clues came from Mrs. Purnell," said 
        Holmes. "Most important were her remarks about Booth's auditing work 
        which kept him from home so many days and nights, often consecutively. I 
        felt certain at once, and inquiry confirmed, that Mr. Booth had had no 
        such extra work at all. Why then had he invented lies to explain these 
        absences to his landlady? Probably because they were in some way 
        connected, either with the crime, or with his plans for escaping after 
        he had committed it. It was inconceivable that so much mysterious 
        outdoor occupation could be directly connected with the forgery, and I 
        at once deduced that this time had been spent by Booth in paving the way 
        for his escape.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Almost at once the idea that he had been living a 
        double life occurred to me, his intention doubtless being to quietly 
        drop one individuality after committing the crime and permanently take 
        up the other—a far safer and less clumsy expedient than the usual one of 
        assuming a new disguise just at the moment when everybody is expecting 
        and looking for you to do so.</P>
        <P align=justify>"Then there were the interesting facts relating to 
        Booth's picture and books. I tried to put myself in his place. He valued 
        these possessions highly; they were light and portable, and there was 
        really no reason whatever why he should part with them. Doubtless, then, 
        he had taken them away by degrees and put them someplace where he could 
        lay hands on them again. If I could find out where this place was, I 
        felt sure there would be every chance I could catch him when he 
        attempted to recover them.</P>
        <P align=justify>"The picture couldn't have gone far for he had taken it 
        out with him on the very day of the crime ... I needn't bore you with 
        details ... I was two hours making inquiries before I found the house at 
        which he had called and left it—which was none other than Mrs. 
        Thackary's in Glossop Road.</P>
        <P align=justify>"I made a pretext for calling there and found Mrs. T. 
        one of the most easy mortals in the world to pump. In less than half an 
        hour I knew that she had a boarder named Winter, that he professed to be 
        a commercial traveler and was from home most of the time. His 
        description resembled Booth's save that he had a mustache, wore 
        glasses.</P>
        <P align=justify>"As I've often tried to impress upon you before, 
        Watson, details are the most important things of all, and it gave me a 
        real thrill of pleasure to learn that Mr. Winter had a cup of chocolate 
        brought up to his bedroom every morning. A gentleman called on the 
        Wednesday morning and left a parcel, saying it was a picture he had 
        promised for Mr. Winter, and asking Mrs. Thackary to give it to Winter 
        when he returned. Mr. Winter had taken the rooms the previous December. 
        He had a good many books which he had brought in from time to time. All 
        these facts taken in conjunction made me certain that I was on the right 
        scent. Winter and Booth were one and the same person, and as soon as 
        Booth had put all his pursuers off the track he would return, as Winter, 
        and repossess his treasures.</P>
        <P align=justify>"The newly taken photo and the old blotter with its 
        telltale note were too obviously intentional means of drawing the police 
        onto Booth's track. The blotter, I could see almost at once, was a 
        fraud, for not only would it be almost impossible to use one in the 
        ordinary way so much without the central part becoming undecipherable, 
        but I could see where it had been touched up.</P>
        <P align=justify>"I concluded therefore that Booth, <I>alias </I>Winter, 
        never actually intended to sail on the <I>Empress Queen, </I>but in that 
        I underestimated his ingenuity. Evidently he booked <I>two </I>berths on 
        the boat, one in his real, and one in his assumed name, and managed very 
        cleverly to successfully keep up the two characters throughout the 
        voyage, appearing first as one individual and then as the other. Most of 
        the time he posed as Winter, and for this purpose Booth became the 
        eccentric semi-invalid passenger who remained locked up in his cabin for 
        such a large part of his time. This, of course, would answer his purpose 
        well; his eccentricity would only draw attention to his presence on 
        board and so make him one of the best-known passengers on the boat, 
        although he showed so little of himself.</P>
        <P align=justify>"I had left instructions with Mrs. Thackary to send me 
        a wire as soon as Winter returned. When Booth had led his pursuers to 
        New York, and there thrown them off the scent, he had nothing more to do 
        but to take the first boat back. Very naturally it chanced to be the 
        same as that on which our friend Lestrade returned, and that was how 
        Mrs. Thackary's wire arrived at the opportune moment it 
      did."</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></FONT><!--msnavigation--></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
